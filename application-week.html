</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This week I've been writing fellowship &amp; grant applications and paper
proposals. I've applied to two places (the DSRG and the Clark) to get
money to go to LA and see the Wilde typescript. Besides these
applications, I also submitted an abstract to a special edition of
Digital Humanities Quarterly on Minimal Computing, on my highlighter
tool as a tool that resists the tendency of EdTech to track and
quantify student data.</p>
<p>Writing out the various proposals forced me to see my project within
the space of few sentences, and I struggled here to articulate the
role of "queerness." Here's what I came up with in the intro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the broad field of the Digital Humanities (DH), an emerging
Queer DH explores what is queer about digital methods and media. These
initiatives often critique the practice of using digital tools to
verify, correct, or establish “facts” about cultural materials,
preferring instead to orient technological contexts around speculation
and experimentation. In support of such efforts, my project excavates
the limitations of digital methods that overlook or collapse the
complexity of literary materials to consider how they might open
possibilities for queer scholarship. I examine how the processes of
electronic editing, social reading and archiving tools draw attention
to the ambiguities of queer subjectivity, experience, and
embodiment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main point I was trying to get across is how "queerness" in media
centers on the ways that tools act unexpectedly, give us unexpected or
suprising results---they are "queer" in sense that they diverge from
the "norm". This idiosyncrasy (and it <em>is</em> an idiosyncrasy) of digital
tools results from the condition of being embodied, of their material
and physical existence as hardware and software, a condition that's
often overlooked by what Matt Kirschenbaum calls digital media's
"formal materiality," the illusion that objects on the screen have no
connection to hardware realities. So, in order to explore this
condition, it's necessary to take apart the machine, to look at its
components and software to see how it works. We start to see how
machines are not the flawless, homogenous, objective workers we
thought them to be, we see how they are built by humans.</p>
<p>As we begin to look more closely into computational processes, we also
see the parallels between computational and human cognitive
processing. We start to appreciate how both humans and machines
closely resemble each other, how they both make mistakes and
misreadings. We start to develop a new way of understanding how they
might interact, how they can fit (or mis/fit) together. This is where
queer materiality leads to dis/ability.</p>
<p>It's a strange trajectory of ideas here: first I'm saying that there's
something flawed and messed up about computers, something
fundamentally physical and therefore unpredictable. Then I'm saying
this problem with computers actually reflects the way that humans are
built, the way that human bodies, perception, memory works. <em>Then</em> I'm
saying that this creates new ways of looking at human/computer
interactions. This new way accepts difference, surprise,
strangeness---queerness---as a minimum for interaction.  </p>
<p>This seems to me a very tenuous line of argument, something that can
be easily critiqued and taken down at each step. Especially when
considering the other ways I use queer, which is a reading practice
and a subject matter. Maybe those other understanding of queer build
toward this one about media and bodies?</p>
<p>Another thought---more exciting---that my dissertation chapters can
focus on one part of the above argument:
- first chapter: on reading---there is something fundamentally
  physical and therefore unpredictable about computational
  processes. Creates a critical distance /relationality between reader
  and text.
- second chapter: on editing---this issue with computers actually
  reflects back to a human issue (Caughie: the questioning of
  computing gender leads us back to gender ontology) of fully knowing
  and formalizing ourselves. 
- third chapter: on annotating---this queerness shared across humans
  and computers can guide the way we create/use digital tools, in a
  way that accepts difference, surprise, strangeness as a minimum for
  interaction.
- fourth chapter: archiving---do I need a fourth chapter? Maybe this
  can become some kind of epilogue</p>
