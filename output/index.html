</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Reading over all of the posts on this blog, I'm struck by how my thoughts have revolved around the defining queerness and deploying it for my project. </p>
<p>Early on, I remember being guided by this idea of queerness as something that is not fully intelligible, not able to be fully grasped. Something that can only be apprehended through formal manipulations, abstractions, which the digital provides in structures and objects in digtized formats. </p>
<p>In my research, I was drawn to critics who used the digital to create new forms---pretty much all descending from jerome mcgann---that attend to materiality of the appratus (bode, clement) and affords opportunities for social critique by engaging what is not visible in data (drucker, mandell, klein). I found something really refreshing in the way that they turned to digital methods as a medium, as a method for exploring the mechanism of analysis and critique, its constraints, and the possiblities contained within these constraints. The most exciting thing is how digital methods offer a way formalizing textual data for analysis.  </p>
<p>I tried to apply these methods back to queer studies, without really having a solid sense for what "queerness" was, besides being something that eludes one's grasp. I then sort of developed this idea of "queerness as a constraint," as an enabling constraint like digital formats are an enabling constraint. In my first chapter, I examined butler's performativity as a structure that plays with text analysis; in my second chapter, I examined queer historiography as a structure that plays with text encoding. In my final chapter, I examined theories of the flesh that play with those of electronic media.</p>
<p>Here's an articulation of my project from A good articulation, from 2020, which I think still applies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The progression builds off the notion of touch, then immediately brings in that which is untouchable---queerness and data, and starts to plot how we might move from there, into a criticism that celebrates detachment by turning to the body and abstraction. Bodies engaging with the subject matter through abstraction. By abstracting data, we can move within them and interface with them. Something along those lines. </p>
</blockquote>
<!---
My interests:
- exploring pre-verbal responses to reading in digital annotation tool
- critiquing edtech that tracks and quantifies student performance
- text analysis questions that resist conclusions, finding
  answers. Text analysis as a part of a speculative process, play.
- disability is positioned early on as the logical conclusion of my
  research into queer methodology. Of finding alternative methods of
  human-computer interaction. Looking at computers and humans in their
  physical, sensual dimensions opens up the possibilities for
  interaction.
- critical methods where the critic is aware of their distance from
  the object of study, and at times turns that distance into a
  heuristic. This begins with an interest in different reading
  methods, suspicious vs surface reading, for example. My being drawn
  to Sedgwick's critique of paranoia that only delivers results which
  are imaginable within current knowledge structures, on their
  inability to create something new. The drive to establish or expose
  props up the current system. We need ways of *speculating* and
  *making*.

My worries:
- taking some questions about my work very personally, as resistance
  or attacks. though this is a legitimate thing too.
- insecurity about taking on projects that are too big, like with
  hypothes.is
- instrumentalizing black feminist studies. How to take the flesh in
  black femininist studies as an analogue to media in media
  archaeology without reducing the very violent and physical history
  of the black flesh. How do I talk about the flesh, mobilize ideas
  of the flesh, without feeling like I'm instrumentalizing it?

In a meeting in 2019, M asked me some quesitons to help me whittle
down my motives.


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>How would I summarize my project in one sentence? 
- About looking at ways that technology disrupts our expectations. How
  it prompts the incommensurable. 

What am I most interested in? 
- The materiality of media, and of human bodies. 
</code></pre></div>
