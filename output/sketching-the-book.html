</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So I have been thinking more and more about my dissertation, and what
to do with it. At first, I really resisted the idea of publishing
it. That genre of academic writing, which I purposefully mimed as a
learning exercise, feels inauthentic to me in the end. When I look at
those pages I see an attempt to fit into a type of mold that doesn't
reflect my energy and process as a thinker and a writer. </p>
<p>Something more authentic would be terse, mobile, moving from one idea
to the next, but with a very strong underlying structure. It would not
be long-form (typical of academic writing) but just as deeply
researched. The main body would be clean of references, but the notes
would be encoded in an interesting way, maybe in the margins. I
imagine something between a tutorial and a manifesto, where each
chapter takes up one computational concept, like text analysis or text
encoding, and guides the reader through a queer inflected methodology
for using that tool.</p>
<p>Here's an outline of the chapters:
- text analysis
- data formats 
- interface effects
- artificial intelligence</p>
<p>In analyzing the tools, the chapters would in turn explore concepts
theorized by Queer Studies, Black Feminist Studies, and Trans Studies,
like Gender Performativity, Dis-identifcation, Surface Aesthetics, and
Transphobia. I would want to find perhaps a tighter way of tying these
concepts together, because they do go in all directions. </p>
<p>The main argument of the book is that computational structures create
power structures that reduce the complexity of real world
subjects. But we can resist that reduction by re-deploying its own
logic against it. Taking up the same process but with a slight
difference. This is an old argument, of course. </p>
