<!--- What I want to include on this page:
- what is this website, what it contains
- overview of my project
- who I am
-->

This website contains my ideas toward a dissertation on "Queer Tools."
It houses an original [proposal](../prospectus) for my project, and a
[blog](../index.html) that tracks the development and struggles in my
thinking and writing. In the future, I hope to include drafts of my
chapters, hopefully in a way that enables feedback from readers.

The short pitch of my project is that I'm talking a critical look at a
variety of digital tools to see how they don't work, or work in
unexpected ways, to study life writing by queer authors. I'm
interested in manuscripts, diaries, journals, and memoirs from the
"long 20th century," mostly a handpicked group of modernists and
contemporary authors, including Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Djuna
Barnes, Roland Barthes, Alison Bechdel, Jor
