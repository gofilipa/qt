<!--- What I want to include on this page:
- what is this website, what it contains
- overview of my project
- who I am
-->

This website contains my ideas toward a dissertation on "Queer Tools."
It houses an original [proposal](../prospectus) for my project, and a
[blog](../index.html) that tracks the development and struggles in my
thinking and writing. In the future, I hope to include drafts of my
chapters, hopefully in a way that enables feedback from readers.

The short pitch of my project is that I'm talking a critical look at a
variety of digital tools to see how they don't work, or work in
unexpected ways, to study life writing by queer authors. I'm
interested in manuscripts, diaries, journals, and memoirs from the
"long 20th century," mostly a handpicked group of modernists and
contemporary authors, including Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Djuna
Barnes, Roland Barthes, Alison Bechdel, Jordy Rosenberg, Carmen Maria
Machado, etc. To study these authors, I examine a range of digital
tools used for reading, editing, annotating, and archiving. Each
chapter of this project takes up one of these tools to explore a facet
of this central question: How does digital media facilitate queer
encounters with literature? By "queer," I mean to push against the
idea that these digital methods are somehow more objective, rational,
or verifiable than traditional scholaraly practices.

Besides working on this dissertation, I'm also a [Digital
Fellow](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) for the Graduate Center
Digital Initiatives, where I work on suppporting students and faculty
who want to integrate digital research methods into their work, and an
English Instructor at Hunter College, where I teach [a course on
writing and literature](bit.ly/engl220fall19).
