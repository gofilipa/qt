SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma Act of \\n2021''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed \\n        to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy \\n        Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy \\n        Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP'') to work directly \\n        with parliaments around the world to support the development of \\n        effective, independent, and responsive legislative \\n        institutions.\\n            (2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership \\n        with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional \\n        delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by \\n        State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in \\n        May 2016.\\n            (3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State \\n        assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's \\n        ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of \\n        government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, \\n        2021.\\n            (4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military \\n        declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, \\n        and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the \\n        capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the \\n        democratically elected government and parliament.\\n\\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\\n\\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\\n            (1) due to the Burmese military's seizure of government \\n        through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, \\n        President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not \\n        represented by a democratically elected government;\\n            (2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to \\n        begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military's \\n        actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma's \\n        Parliament, and thereby the country;\\n            (3) the will and determination of those duly-elected \\n        Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to \\n        continue serving as representatives of the people through \\n        alternative methods of communicating and convening should be \\n        lauded; and\\n            (4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, \\n        the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively \\n        nullified the international collaborative relationships that \\n        have supported and strengthened the institution, including the \\n        Burmese parliament's partnership with HDP.\\n\\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\\n\\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\\n            (1) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \\n        (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to--\\n                    (A) condemn the military coup in Burma;\\n                    (B) urge the unconditional release of detained \\n                democratically elected leaders and civil society \\n                members; and\\n                    (C) support a return to Burma's democratic \\n                transition; and\\n            (2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United \\n        States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the \\n        United States at the United Nations to hold accountable those \\n        responsible for the military coup in Burma.\\n\\nSEC. 5. REPORT.\\n\\n    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \\nthe Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs \\nand the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and \\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \\nof the Senate a report on the military coup in Burma, including a \\ndescription of efforts to implement the policy specified in section 4.\\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\\n</pre></body></html>\\n<html><body><pre>\\n[Congressional Bills 117th Congress]\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\n[H.R. 435 Introduced in House (IH)]\\n\\n&lt;DOC&gt;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n117th CONGRESS\\n  1st Session\\n                                H.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Diaper Assistance Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Infants need between 6 to 12 diapers a day. Infants and \\n        toddlers lacking access to clean diapers have a greater risk \\n        for health complications, which require costly and difficult to \\n        access medical care.\\n            (2) Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys indicated that \\n        1 in 3 families in the United States with young children could \\n        not afford an adequate supply of diapers to keep their child \\n        clean, dry, and healthy.\\n            (3) Low-income families pay an even higher than average \\n        price for diapers because they do not have access to money \\n        saving alternatives such as bulk buying or online shopping that \\n        can reduce costs. Low-income families spend about 14 percent of \\n        their income on diapers.\\n            (4) Clean diaper access presents a financial and stressful \\n        burden on families' dependent on child care services. Research \\n        indicates that when diaper need is a barrier to child care, \\n        parents miss an average of 4 workdays a month.\\n            (5) The COVID-19 pandemic has further raised demand for \\n        diapers and strained diaper banks' ability to meet low-income \\n        families' needs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofit \\n        diaper bank distribution only met 5 to 6 percent of diaper \\n        need. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, diaper banks \\n        around the country have experienced double, triple, or greater \\n        increase in demand for diapers due to the pandemic and economic \\n        shutdown. Nonprofits alone cannot fully address this public \\n        health crisis that impacts 1 in 3 families in the United \\n        States.\\n\\nSEC. 3. TARGETED FUNDING FOR STATES FOR DIAPER ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE \\n              SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM.\\n\\n    (a) Increase in Funding for Social Services Block Grant Program.--\\n            (1) In general.--The amount specified in subsection (c) of \\n        section 2003 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397b) for \\n        purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of such section is deemed \\n        to be $1,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2021, of which \\n        $200,000,000 shall be obligated by States in accordance with \\n        subsection (b).\\n            (2) Appropriation.--Out of any money in the Treasury of the \\n        United States not otherwise appropriated, there are \\n        appropriated $200,000,000, which shall be available for \\n        payments under section 2002 of the Social Security Act (42 \\n        U.S.C. 1397a), which shall remain available for expenditure \\n        through December 31, 2022.\\n            (3) Deadline for distribution of funds.--Within 45 days \\n        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \\n        Health and Human Services shall distribute the funds made \\n        available by this subsection, which shall be made available to \\n        States on an emergency basis for immediate obligation and \\n        expenditure.\\n            (4) Submission of revised pre-expenditure report.--Within \\n        90 days after a State receives funds made available by this \\n        subsection, the State shall submit to the Secretary of Health \\n        and Human Services a revised pre-expenditure report pursuant to \\n        subtitle A of title XX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \\n        1397 et seq,.) that describes how the State plans to administer \\n        the funds in accordance with subsection (b).\\n            (5) Deadline for obligation of funds by states.--A State to \\n        which funds made available by this subsection are distributed \\n        shall obligate the funds not later than December 31, 2021.\\n            (6) Deadline for expenditure of funds.--A grantee to which \\n        a State provides funds made available by this subsection (or a \\n        subgrantee of such a grantee) shall expend the funds not later \\n        than December 31, 2022.\\n    (b) Rules Governing Use of Additional Funds.--Funds are used in \\naccordance with this subsection if--\\n            (1) the funds are used to provide through social service \\n        agencies or other nonprofit organizations, diapers and \\n        diapering supplies (including diaper wipes and diaper cream, \\n        necessary to ensure that a child using a diaper is properly \\n        cleaned and protected from diaper rash) to families in need;\\n            (2) the funds are used subject to the limitations in \\n        section 2005 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397d);\\n            (3) the funds are used to supplement, not supplant, State \\n        general revenue funds provided for the purposes described in \\n        paragraph (1); and\\n            (4) the funds are not used for costs that are reimbursable \\n        by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, under a contract \\n        for insurance, or by self-insurance.\\n    (c) Reports.--\\n            (1) Grantees and subgrantees.--Not later than December 31, \\n        2022, each grantee to which a State provides funds made \\n        available by subsection (a) (or a subgrantee of such a grantee) \\n        shall submit a report to the State on the use of the funds so \\n        provided.\\n            (2) SSBG annual report.--A State shall include in the \\n        annual report required under section 2006 of the Social \\n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397e) covering fiscal year 2023, \\n        information detailing how grantees and subgrantees used funds \\n        made available under subsection (a) to distribute diapers and \\n        diapering supplies to families in need.\\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\\n</pre></body></html>\\n<html><body><pre>\\n[Congressional Bills 117th Congress]\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\n[H.R. 464 Introduced in House (IH)]\\n\\n&lt;DOC&gt;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n117th CONGRESS\\n  1st Session\\n                                H.

Res. 135, which established the House Democracy Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP'') to work directly with parliaments around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.(2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016.(3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021.(4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the democratically elected government and parliament.SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.It is the sense of Congress that--(1) due to the Burmese military's seizure of government through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a democratically elected government;(2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military's actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma's Parliament, and thereby the country;(3) the will and determination of those duly-elected Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative methods of communicating and convening should be lauded; and(4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the international collaborative relationships that have supported and strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament's partnership with HDP.SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.It is the policy of the United States to--(1) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to--(A) condemn the military coup in Burma;(B) urge the unconditional release of detained democratically elected leaders and civil society members; and(C) support a return to Burma's democratic transition; and(2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for the military coup in Burma.SEC. 5. REPORT.Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a report on the military coup in Burma, including a description of efforts to implement the policy specified in section 4. </html><html><body><pre>[Congressional Bills 117th Congress][From the U.S. Government Publishing Office][H.R. 435 Introduced in House (IH)]&lt;DOC&gt;117th CONGRESS1st SessionH.

SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Diaper Assistance Act''.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) Infants need between 6 to 12 diapers a day. Infants and toddlers lacking access to clean diapers have a greater risk for health complications, which require costly and difficult to access medical care.(2) Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys indicated that 1 in 3 families in the United States with young children could not afford an adequate supply of diapers to keep their child clean, dry, and healthy.(3) Low-income families pay an even higher than average price for diapers because they do not have access to money saving alternatives such as bulk buying or online shopping that can reduce costs. Low-income families spend about 14 percent of their income on diapers.(4) Clean diaper access presents a financial and stressful burden on families' dependent on child care services. Research indicates that when diaper need is a barrier to child care, parents miss an average of 4 workdays a month.(5) The COVID-19 pandemic has further raised demand for diapers and strained diaper banks' ability to meet low-income families' needs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofit diaper bank distribution only met 5 to 6 percent of diaper need. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, diaper banks around the country have experienced double, triple, or greater increase in demand for diapers due to the pandemic and economic shutdown. Nonprofits alone cannot fully address this public health crisis that impacts 1 in 3 families in the United States.SEC. 3. TARGETED FUNDING FOR STATES FOR DIAPER ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM.(a) Increase in Funding for Social Services Block Grant Program.--(1) In general.--The amount specified in subsection (c) of section 2003 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397b) for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of such section is deemed to be $1,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2021, of which $200,000,000 shall be obligated by States in accordance with subsection (b).(2) Appropriation.--Out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, there are appropriated $200,000,000, which shall be available for payments under section 2002 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397a), which shall remain available for expenditure through December 31, 2022.(3) Deadline for distribution of funds.--Within 45 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall distribute the funds made available by this subsection, which shall be made available to States on an emergency basis for immediate obligation and expenditure.(4) Submission of revised pre-expenditure report.--Within 90 days after a State receives funds made available by this subsection, the State shall submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a revised pre-expenditure report pursuant to subtitle A of title XX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq,.) that describes how the State plans to administer the funds in accordance with subsection (b).(5) Deadline for obligation of funds by states.--A State to which funds made available by this subsection are distributed shall obligate the funds not later than December 31, 2021.(6) Deadline for expenditure of funds.--A grantee to which a State provides funds made available by this subsection (or a subgrantee of such a grantee) shall expend the funds not later than December 31, 2022.(b) Rules Governing Use of Additional Funds.--Funds are used in accordance with this subsection if--(1) the funds are used to provide through social service agencies or other nonprofit organizations, diapers and diapering supplies (including diaper wipes and diaper cream, necessary to ensure that a child using a diaper is properly cleaned and protected from diaper rash) to families in need;(2) the funds are used subject to the limitations in section 2005 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397d);(3) the funds are used to supplement, not supplant, State general revenue funds provided for the purposes described in paragraph (1); and(4) the funds are not used for costs that are reimbursable by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, under a contract for insurance, or by self-insurance.(c) Reports.--(1) Grantees and subgrantees.--Not later than December 31, 2022, each grantee to which a State provides funds made available by subsection (a) (or a subgrantee of such a grantee) shall submit a report to the State on the use of the funds so provided.(2) SSBG annual report.--A State shall include in the annual report required under section 2006 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397e) covering fiscal year 2023, information detailing how grantees and subgrantees used funds made available under subsection (a) to distribute diapers and diapering supplies to families in need. </html><html><body><pre>[Congressional Bills 117th Congress][From the U.S. Government Publishing Office][H.R. 464 Introduced in House (IH)]&lt;DOC&gt;117th CONGRESS1st SessionH.
