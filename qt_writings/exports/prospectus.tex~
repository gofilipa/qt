\#+ Queer Tools

\subsection{Problem Statement: Utility of DH Tools}
\label{sec:orgdd4e67a}
\subsubsection{Humanisitic vs. Scientific Inquiry}
\label{sec:orgf50884d}

There has been much debate about what digital tools can do for the
humanities, and literary studies in particular.\footnote{One way to understand this debate is to place theorists who use
digital tools in literary studies on a spectrum, based on their faith
in the ability of methods such as computation, quantification,
visualization, and encoding to pursue and answer questions about
literature. These theorists take different stances on whether DH tools
facilitate a more objective, or what Franco Moretti calls
“falsifiable," method of criticism, where graphs and other
visualizations might answer questions about literary history and form,
or a more “speculative” mode, championed by Johanna Drucker, who
purposefully skews graphical metrics in order to reflect the ambiguity
and partiality of the data they represent. In between these two
extremes, there are theorists like Andrew Piper and Ted Underwood, who
temper the reductions and rhetoric of "distant reading" by
incorporating close readings and explanations, or Catherine D'Ignazio
and Lauren Klein, whose attempts to recover emotion and emobodiment
are a direct indictment on data science as an exclusionary discipline.} Stephen Ramsay
usefully figures this misunderstanding about what DH tools can do by
opposing humanistic endeavor against scientific inquiry. Ramsay
explains that because literary theorists approach observation as a
phenomenal experience, it is antithetical to the motives and processes
of scientific inquiry. Science aims to discover truth, while the
humanities, and literary critics in particular, make readings, so that
conversations about the literary inheritence might continue. When used
responsibly, computers are “tools… that enable critical engagement,
interpretation, conversation, and contemplation” (x). Drawing from
Lisa Samuels' and Jerome McGann's concept of "deformance," Ramsay
takes constraints of computation as an opportunity for reflection on
the ways that critics change and transform the texts under their
scrutiny. His ultimate concern is how these tools function within a
larger rhetorical process: “The understanding promised us by the
critical act arises not from a presentation of facts, but from the
elaboration of a gestalt, and it rightfully includes the vague
reference, the conjectured similitude, ironic twist, and the dramatic
turn. In the spirit of inventio, the critic freely employs the
rhetorical acts of conjecture---not so that a given matter can be
settled, but in order that the matter might become richer, deeper, and
ever more complicated” (16). Using the heightened objectivity made
possible by the machine to do subjective work.

\subsubsection{Falsifiable --> Reproducibility}
\label{sec:org3de8c2a}

The idea persists that computational methods ought to verify, correct,
or establish facts about literature and literary history and
forms. Recently, the conversation has been reignited by an article by
Nan Z Da in \emph{Critical Inquiry} that asserts a "fundamental mismatch
between the statistical tools that are used and the objects to which
they are applied" (601). Because CLS borrows statistical modeling and
tools from the sciences, Da argues, it has the burden to "show us" the
truth. Da's deems Computational Literary Studies (CLS) ineffective
when its methods fail to reproduce the results of her colleagues. Her
emphasis on the "reproducible" ironically extends Moretti's call for a
"falsifiable criticism." Da explains that "if we are employing tools
whose express purpose is functional rather than metaphorical, then we
must use them in accordance with their true functions" (620).

Micki Kaufmann, *Quantifying Kissinger" Dissertation: "it strikes me
that this is a poweful, non-linear example of the value of
visualization as an ongoing process, rather than a one-time production
process that results in a specific finding."p

\subsection{Proposal}
\label{sec:org61010e5}
\subsubsection{Playing Around}
\label{sec:org43ccc2f}

This project interrogates this assumption that the results of using
digital tools ought to be reproducible. Instead, it prosposes that we
mess around with tools in ways that resist the impulses for fixity,
correction, certainty, verification. Such a method values
experimentation exploration and revels in the inconsistencies, errors,
and idiosyncracies of close reading. It examines the ways that both
human minds and computers are prone to making mistakes, and takes
these ironies as points of inspiration for human-computer
interactions. My goal with this project is to explore how digital
methods and media can be used to engage queer subjectivity, embodiment
and affects in 20th century life writing. I am looking specifically at
digital methods that engage reading and interpretive processes, such
as electronic editing practices and social reading tools. Here, I’m
interested in using the “digital” to mine and/or imagine terrains of
affect and cognition in queer texts. How do the logics and limitations
of technology (fail to) reflect the complexities or queer subjectivity
or gender identity? Is it possible to encode or decode queerness? The
computer and body as cultural objects\ldots{} This examination draws me into
studies of consciousness, where I look at cognitive and embodied
perceptual processes and what they might reveal about the reading
experience. I pose a variety of parallels between human and computer
as starting points to speculate on how the affinities between man and
machine might emerge in the interface between reader and text.

\subsubsection{One Stake: Movement}
\label{sec:orgff21826}

Why do I find reproducability so dangerous? Because of apathy. Being motivated, being moved. This is a politics about movement, It follows both positive and negative movement, not just about despair but about hope.

It is moved by images we cannot touch, places we cannot inhabit, persons we cannot identify. Heather Love and Kelly Caldwell are mobilized by it. Munoz focuses on the animating principle, this 'surplus' that anticipates an illumination, a utopian futurity. It can feel good to feed bad. It's not about necessarily getting up and doing something, but about attending to movement.
One major stake is exploring what digital humanities has to gain from
Queer Theory. 

\subsubsection{Human Thought is not Reproducible, Computers are not Immaterial}
\label{sec:org745dc08}

(Pits-Taylor)

Myths about computation that do not hold on the immaterial level. 

Kirschenbaum's screen essentialism

“Commonplace assumptions about …. Ephemerality, fungibility, and
homogeneity. A forensic perspective furnishes us with two key concepts
for an alternative approach to electronic textual studies: trace
evidence and individualization. Ultimately, electronic data assumes
visible and material form through processes of instrumentation that
suggest phenomena we call virtual are in fact physical phenomena
lacking the appropriate mediation to supplement wave-length optics”
(19).

\subsection{Life Writing by Queer Authors}
\label{sec:org49b7f4b}
\subsubsection{Why life writing?}
\label{sec:org2d85183}

This investigation takes "life writing", which includes autobiography,
memoir, journals, manuscripts, as well as fictionalized autobiography,
biography and roman a clef, as its object of study. I use the term
"life writing" loosely: the body of texts in my study do not adhere to
any conventional criteria of genre, except that all of them either
demonstrate a writing self or an experimental style that reflects the
fragmentary and processural nature of subjecthood. My interest in life
writing emerges from a concern with the ways that literary form shapes
the coherence of queer identity and engages embodied affects in
subjective experience. The focus on composition, particularly in the
manuscripts and journals of Oscar Wilde and Virginia Woolf, explores
how writing is an iterative practice that continually calls into
question the delimitations of embodiment and subjectivity. Readings
from what I call 21st century "memoiresque," including works by Alison
Bechdel, Jordy Rosenberg, and Yiyun Li, function as present day
examples of life writing that continues to pose fresh problems for
understanding queer identity. A recurring theme in my analysis is the
difficulty of categorizing and decoding or encoding queer identity,
especially when affective responses to reading get in the way of
interpreation. I am also wary of overanalyzing and delimiting queer
subjecthood. Is it possible to mark queerness as legible so that it
remains dynamic? How do postmoderns writers approach the differences
bewteen fiction and memoir? Woolf's ficitonal biography, \emph{Orlando},
acts as a fulcrum around which the false distinctions of fiction and
nonfiction, writing and the self, revolve. I wonder if these generic
boundaries are even useful.

\subsection{First Chapter: Touching: Toward a Queer DH}
\label{sec:org2a8e815}

The first chapter, "Toward a Queer DH," proposes what Digital
Humanities methodologies might learn from queer theory. It looks at
specific reading practices by Eve Sedgwick and Heather Love, which
question the proper relationship of the critic to the object of
study. Sedgwick's ideas about "touching/feeling" and Love's notion of
"touching but not touching" pose queer modes of relationality that do
not presume full connections as prerequisite for analysis.\footnote{Both Love and Sedgewick search for critical methods outside the
logic of exposure that guides much of "suspicious reading" from
Foucault onward. Though Sedgwick focuses on reconceptualizing
traditionally negative affects (like shame) into creative resources,
and Love prefers to dwell in the painful past, giving irredeemable and
inconsolable characters full reign over their own darkness, both
critics look at touch as a new way of making connections.} This
chapter engages these techniques with various critical methods, many
from the Digital Humanities, such as distant, surface, and
post-critical reading, and deformative, algorithmic, and speculative
criticism. I pay particular attention to how digital formats and
interfaces might harness queer critical methods, speculating on the
intimate process of engaging with texts on a computer, where users can
manipulate and transform texts in virtually infinite and unique
ways. Examining two digital projects, a text analysis and
visualization web application called \emph{Voyant-Tools}, and a hypertext
novella by Caitlin Fischer, \emph{These Waves of Girls}, I reflect how the
tools work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what Jerome McGann
calls a “prosthetic extension of that demand for critical reflection,”
by which the reader is able to feel her way through the text. In
particular, I examine the haptic and exploratory methods might enliven
the reading process by allowing the reader to play, experiment, and
imagine new connections to the textual object.

\subsection{Second Chapter: Editing: Encoding Identity}
\label{sec:org89ea258}

The second chapter poses two contrasting ideas---the instability of
queer identity and subjecthood against the limitations and fixities of
computational methods. How do the abstractions and structures of
digital formats struggle or fail to mark the complexities of embodied
experience? To answer this question, I first review the relation
between queerness and loss, failure and negative affects. Then, I
explore how TEI (the Text Encoding Initiative), an encoding standard
or "markup language" for electronic editig, struggles to portray the
complexity of the data it represents. Here, I demonstrate how TEI
might be used to mark up the manuscript of Oscar Wilde's \emph{The Picture
of Dorian Gray}, which was twice edited by Wilde in ways that
minimized homoerotic content, among other changes. I question how TEI
as a standard enables editors to mark up such revisions, given the
hierarchical structure of XML (TEI's parent language) and the
available relevant "tags" for marking up manuscripts. I bring my
investigation into conversation with other critics and teachers who
have found difficulty with their own deployments of TEI: Pamela
Caughie, who's attempts to encode gender in Lili Elbe's memoir, \emph{Man
Into Woman}, turn a question of about technical difficulty back to the
difficulty of pinning down sexual identity: "Can ontologies ever
capture the complex, multi-layered, dynamic nature of gender
identities?” Throughout my conversation about \emph{Dorian Gray}, I bring
up examples of 21st century queer memoirs who have experimented with
alternative ways of figuring queer identity and subjecthood. This
chapter ends by delving into the complex question of gender ontology
and sexual identity, which are never fully legible despite our tools.

\subsection{Third Chapter: Teaching: Social Annotation}
\label{sec:orgd6cd8aa}

The third chapter questions how digital tools might facilitate
embodied interactions with text. To begin to answer this question, I
examine biological processes of perception and analogies between man
and machine. I take the figure of cyborg to explore
biological-mechanical intersections, such as neurons and transistors,
memory and RAM, in order to re-present the human as a creative
machine, a thinking/feeling machine. This human-computer engagement,
rather than reduce the differences between humans and machines, allows
me to explore unexpected affinities that emerge in the interface
between reader and text. Understanding how certain perceptual and
computational processes work across biological and mechanical levels,
I argue, will spark our thinking about how humans might interact with
machines. I take up social annotation as a test case, examining a
particular digital annotation tool that I've modified for purposes of
engaging preverbal and nonverbal embodied and affective responses
while reading. This examination ends with a close reading of Virginia
Woolf and Djuna Barnes novels, to see both how their prose evokes some
of the perceptual processes involved in reading and writing as well as
how digital annotation practice helps readers to recognize these
processes. How might formal strategies developed by modernist writers
engage cognitive/affective/embodied processes?

\subsection{Fourth Chapter/Epilogue: Temporalities: Feeling Backward / Feed Forward}
\label{sec:org33db18b}

Language, consciousness/perception, and media are all characterized by a displacement between what we see/experience and how it works/functions. The explanatory gap, forensic vs formal materiality, the instability of the signifier. This displacement creates a space for my speculations.

Lesbian Herstory Archive \& Media Archaeology

Hansen and Love:
Emergent perceptual experiences combined with backward looking
affects. 

Isn't the fractured sign (Tenen) an opportunity for play?

Media and Immediacy: 
Does the pleasure of reading reside more in the collapsing of the interface between reader and text, or in the excavation of the textual conduit? By interface, I mean the invisible encoding or tagging that appends electronic text, as well as the codes that guide interpretation (Barthes)---do we deconstruct or do we pursue narrative desire/closure (Fisher)?
