<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Since Franco Moretti first drew attention to "distant reading," there
has been much debate about what digital tools can do for the
humanities, and literary studies in particular.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Although many DH
practitioners have been careful to situate their methodologies within
the context of humanistic study, there persists an idea that digital
methods ought to verify, correct, or establish facts about literature
and literary history, similarly to the sciences. Clarifying the
distinction, Stephen Ramsay points out that, while scientific inquiry
aims to describe the 'real world,' the humanities approach observation
as a phenomenal experience. Drawing from Lisa Samuels's and Jerome
McGann's concept of "deformative critcism," Ramsay frames the
constraints of computation as an opportunity for reflection on the
ways that critics change and transform the texts under their
scrutiny. He reminds us that digital tools function within a larger,
rhetorical process: “The understanding promised us by the critical act
arises not from a presentation of facts, but from the elaboration of a
gestalt, and it rightfully includes the vague reference, the
conjectured similitude, ironic twist, and the dramatic turn"
(16). However, in continuing to underestimate the role of critical
subjectivity in analysis, critics have begun to double down on the
pretense of objectivity promised by DH methods. Recently, Nan Z. Da
deems Computational Literary Studies ineffective when her own
experiments fail to reproduce or verify the results of her
colleagues. Her emphasis on the "reproducible" extends Moretti's call
from 1983 for a "falsifiable criticism"—both advocating for a
methodology that is as reliable and verifiable as the sciences. Though
Moretti and Da are starkly opposed on the actual efficacy of digital
methods, they both value the objectivity made possible by the machine.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This project interrogates the assumption that the results of using
digital tools ought to be reproducible or falsifiable. Instead, it
proposes that we use tools in ways that resist the impulses for
fixity, correction, certainty, verification. Such a method values
experimentation and exploration, and revels in the inconsistencies,
errors, and idiosyncrasies of close reading. It examines the ways that
both human minds and computers are prone to making mistakes and
misreadings, and takes these ironies as points of inspiration for
re-imagining human-computer interactions. I look at digital methods
that engage reading and interpretive processes, such as electronic
editing practices and social reading tools. Here, I’m interested in
how these methods allow users to mine and/or imagine terrains of
affect in queer life writing and compositional forms, such as memoirs,
journals, and manuscripts. This examination of affect draws me into
studies of consciousness, where I look at cognitive and embodied
perceptual processes and what they might reveal about the reading
experience. I take a variety of parallels between human and computer
as starting points to speculate on how the affinities between man and
machine might emerge in the interface between reader and text. My goal
with this project is to explore how digital methods and media can be
used to engage questions about queer embodied experience and
subjectivity. How do the logics and limitations of technology reflect
the complexities of identity? How might we “encode” or “decode”
queerness?

<h2 id="org005118d"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Queer DH Now</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
As an emerging field, Queer DH is still finding and outing itself,
unlike more popular and established Digital methodologies, like
Computational Literary Studies. Tracing the current trajectory of
Queer DH, Bonnie Ruberg, Jason Boyd, and James Howe point out that
“many of the data-driven initiatives that have earned DH its most
visible accolades eschew rather than engage topics of difference and
identity” (108). In response, these authors constellate some ways that
“queerness” might engage DH research practices, focusing heavily on
speculative or critical making projects that interrogate the
constructed nature of objects and promote play. For example, Zach Blas
and micha cárdenas’s transCoder, a “queer programming anti-language,”
features programming functions like the “destabilizationLoop(),”
inspired by Judith Butler, which “breaks apart any process that acts
as a continuously iterating power” (“Queer Technologies /
transCoder”). Another project that probes the possibilities of
queerness and DH is “Queer OS: A User’s Manual,” created by Fiona
Barnett, Zach Blas, micha cárdenas, Jacob Gaboury, Jessica Marie
Johnson, and Margaret Rhee, who reimagine how various components of an
operating system, such as interfaces, applications and memory, might
work (or not) within an ethos of queerness. The speculative nature of
these projects is a necessary step that allows us to imagine the
emergence of queered technological contexts, but it also overlooks the
ways in which current technological systems already contain elements
of queerness. While these projects address what they perceive to be a
lack of queer analysis and methods in DH, mine looks to the queerness
of our present tools, and to the assumptions about functionality that
queerness evokes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
At stake here is the critic's relation to the object of study. Some DH
critics have already proposed useful models for reading that emphasize
the critic's role in analysis, such as Ramsay's "algorithmic
criticism," McGann and Samuel's "deformative criticism," and Johanna
Drucker's "Speculative Computing." These approaches are careful to
temper the common reductions and rhetoric of "distant reading" by
being explicit about the role of critical self-awareness and the
constructed nature of data in their analysis. In a parallel vein,
Queer Theory has also been exploring new ways of relating to textual
objects in ways that do not delimit them. But, unlike DH, it has been
forced to contend with affect, particularly negative affect, where it
is plagued by what to do with bad feelings that arise when confronting
histories of queer exclusion, repression, and violence. As a result,
according to Eve Sedgwick, critics are compelled to pursue "the
heroic, ‘liberatory,’ inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting
down and attacking prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic
guises” (10). This logic of exposure perpetuates modes of "suspicious"
or "paranoid" reading, in which, according to critics like Sedgwick,
Rita Felski and Heather Love, the goal of demystification closes off
alternative ways and possibilities for responding to. Throughout my
project, Sedgwick's idea of "touching/feeling," looking "beside rather
than beneath," joins forces with Love's idea of "touching withought
touching" to offer a model of relationality that resists the
temptations to verify, establish, or fix knowledge about queer
subjects.2.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
An important figure for this project is the cyborg, that
human-computer engagement offered up by Donna Haraway which embodies
the blurring of boundaries between human and machine and does away
with the old dualisms of natural/artificial and mind/body,
man/machine, etc. In Haraway's imaginary, the dissolution of
categories opens a space for new coalitions and a politics based on
affinity rather than identity. My project deconstructs man and machine
as cultural objects to replace them with the image of the cyborg,
repurposed to explore the illuminating parallels between cognition and
computation. My deconstruction of media and perceptual processes finds
many points of intersection between the biological-mechancial, such as
neurons and transistors, memory and RAM, that are used to spur our
thinking about human-machine interfaces. My forays into media
archaeology and studies of consciousness bring me to the boundary
between the material and the immaterial, to the gaps in our knowledge
about how our machines and minds works. In tracing the relationship
between the material and the immaterial, I speculate on how words mark
us, trigger our emotions, memories, to create aesthetic, affective
reading experiences.

<h2 id="orgf061485"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Life Writing by Queer Authors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
This investigation takes life writing, which includes autobiography,
memoir, fictionalized autobiography, biography and roman a clef, as
well as compositional forms like journals and manuscripts, as its main
focus of study. I use the term "life writing" loosely, without
adhering to any conventional criteria of genre, besides demonstrating
a writing self or an experimental style that reflects the fragmentary
and processural nature of subjecthood. My interest in life writing
emerges from a concern with the ways that literary form shapes the
coherence of queer identity and engages embodied affects and
experience. Woolf's fictional biography, Orlando, acts as a fulcrum
around which the false distinctions of fictionality and biography,
writing and the self, revolve. The focus on composition, particularly
in the manuscripts and journals of Oscar Wilde and Virginia Woolf,
highlights how writing is an iterative practice that continually calls
into question the constructions of embodiment and
subjectivity. Readings from what I call the "memoiresque," including
21st century works by Alison Bechdel, Jordy Rosenberg, and Yiyun Li,
function as present day examples of life writing that continue to pose
fresh problems for understanding identity and affect. A recurring
theme in my analysis is the difficulty of categorizing and decoding or
encoding queer identity, especially when affective responses to
reading get in the way of interpretation, or overanalysis delimits
queer subjecthood. Is it possible to mark queerness as legible while
keeping it dynamic?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
The first chapter, "'Touching but not Touching:' Toward a Queer DH,"
lays out what Digital Humanities methodologies might learn from queer
theory. It looks at specific reading practices by Eve Sedgwick and
Heather Love, which question the proper relationship of the critic to
the object of study. Sedgwick's ideas about "touching/feeling" and
Love's notion of "touching but not touching" pose queer modes of
relationality that do not presume full connections as prerequisite for
analysis. This chapter engages these techniques with various critical
methods, many from the Digital Humanities, such as distant, surface,
and post-critical reading, and deformative, algorithmic, and
speculative criticism. I pay particular attention to how digital
formats and interfaces might harness queer critical methods,
speculating on the intimate process of engaging with texts on a
computer, where users can manipulate and transform texts in virtually
infinite and unique ways. Examining two digital projects, a text
analysis and visualization web application called Voyant-Tools, and a
hypertext novella by Caitlin Fischer, These Waves of Girls, I reflect
how these tools work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what McGann
calls a “prosthetic extension of that demand for critical reflection,”
by which the reader is able to feel her way through the text. In
particular, I question how the haptic and exploratory activity of
working with these tool might enliven the reading process by allowing
the reader to play, experiment, and imagine new connections to the
textual object.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
The second chapter, "Editing: Encoding Identity," examines two
contrasting ideas—the instability of queer identity and subjecthood
against the limitations and fixities of computational methods. How do
the abstractions and structures of digital formats struggle or fail to
mark the complexities of embodied experience and identity? To answer
this question, I first review the relation between queerness and
negative affects like loss, failure and shame. Then, I explore how TEI
(the Text Encoding Initiative), an encoding standard or "markup
language" for electronic editing, struggles to portray the complexity
of the data it represents. Here, I demonstrate how TEI might be used
to mark up the manuscript of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray,
which was repeatedly edited by Wilde in ways that minimized homoerotic
content. I question how TEI as a markup standard enables editors to
register such revisions, given the hierarchical structure of XML
(TEI's parent language) and the availability of relevant "tags" for
marking up manuscripts. I bring my investigation into conversation
with other critics who have stumbled across productive failures with
their own deployments of TEI. For example, Pamela Caughie's attempts
to encode gender in Lili Elbe's memoir, Man Into Woman, turn the issue
of technical difficulty back to the difficulty of pinning down sexual
identity, leading her to question whether "ontologies [can] ever
capture the complex, multi-layered, dynamic nature of gender
identities” (1). Throughout my conversation about Dorian Gray, I bring
up examples of 21st century queer memoirs that experiment with
alternative ways of figuring queer identity and subjecthood. This
chapter ends by emphasizing the complex question of gender ontology
and sexual identity, which are never fully legible despite our tools.

<h3 id="org990cc98"><span class="section-number-3">7.3</span> Teaching: Social Annotation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">
<p>
The third chapter, "Teaching: Social Annotation," questions how
digital annotation tools might facilitate embodied interactions with
text. To begin to answer this question, I examine biological processes
of perception and analogies between man and machine. I take the figure
of cyborg to explore biological-mechanical intersections in order to
re-present the human as a creative machine, a thinking/feeling
machine. This human-computer engagement, rather than reduce the
differences between humans and machines, allows me to explore
unexpected affinities that emerge in the interface between reader and
text. Interrogating the ways that certain perceptual and computational
processes work across biological and mechanical levels sparks my
thinking about human-machine interactions. I take up social annotation
as a test case, examining a particular digital annotation tool that
I've modified for purposes of engaging preverbal and nonverbal
responses while reading. This chapter ends with a close reading of
Virginia Woolf and Djuna Barnes’s novels, to see how their prose
evokes some of the perceptual processes involved in reading and
writing as well as how digital annotation practice helps readers to
recognize these processes. I highlight how these writers' formal
strategies engage cognitive, affective, and embodied reading
processes.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-4">
<p>
The fourth chapter, "Queer Temporalities: Feeling Backward / Feed
Forward," explores how displacements across our understanding of
media, perception, and language affects our engagement with literary
objects. Here, various displacements between how we see/experience
digitized literary and cultural objects and how they work/function
offer a model for thinking about how we interact with these
objects. In digital media, there is a central displacement between
what we see on the screen and what is inscribed in the computer’s
hardware—what Matt Kirschenbaum refers to as the levels of formal and
forensic materiality. Within the neuroscientific and philosophical
debates about consciousness, the central displacement is the
“explanatory gap," or the idea that the physiological processes of the
body, such as the neurons firing in the brain, cannot explain the
quality of sensation that is being experienced by each
individual. With language, displacement inheres in the stubborn
instability of the signifier, which is passed through words, syntactic
structures and sound to signify meaning. This chapter examines how the
digitization practices of textual objects engage these displacements
to open up our experience and interpretation of them. I look at the
examples of the Lesbian Herstory Archive digitization efforts and
"Comparing Marks: A Versioning Edition of Virginia Woolf's 'A Mark on
the Wall,'" a digital resource of print witnesses of Woolf's short
story across time. I find in these examples an occasion for thinking
through how emergent perceptual experiences (Mark Hansen's idea of
"Feed Forward") might contend with backward looking or negative
affects of queer theory (Love's model of "Feeling Backward").

These theorists take different stances on whether DH tools
facilitate a more objective, or what Franco Moretti calls
“falsifiable," method of criticism, where graphs and other
visualizations might answer questions about literary history and form,
or a more “speculative” mode, championed by Johanna Drucker, who
purposefully skews graphical metrics in order to reflect the ambiguity
and partiality of the data they represent. In between these two
extremes, there are theorists like Andrew Piper and Ted Underwood, who
temper the reductions and rhetoric of "distant reading" by
incorporating close readings and explanations, or Catherine D'Ignazio
and Lauren Klein, whose attempts to recover emotion and emobodiment
are a direct indictment on data science as an exclusionary discipline.
