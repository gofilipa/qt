/The desire to write is the desire to fool you, seduce you. Here I
am - again - always getting the girl, saying the right thing or (toss
this in for effect) something deliciously, winsomely wrong. Look over
there - that's me, at four&#x2026;/
</p>

<p>
Caitlin Fisher's electronic work, <i>These Waves of Girls</i>, tempts the
reader through its pages with links to seductive phrases like "the
desire" or "that's me, at four&#x2026;"  ("desire_to_write.htm"). Though
they are associative in nature, supporting the work's de-centralized
formal structure, the links also defer narrative coherence within the
story, a sexual coming of age of a young lesbian woman named
Tracey. Clicking through a few episodes, the text reveals itself to
be, like much of the "hypertext fiction" of the time,
disorienting. The links offer a profusion of narrative paths that
disrupt the relationship between cause and effect, halting the
narrative progression in what James Pope describes as "a baffling
range of choices for movement which actually led to a stifling of
movement altogether" (11).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./videos/erotic.gif" alt="erotic.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In addition to dogging this perpetual deferral of narrative
coherence, the reader also follows the narrator's elusive promise of
sexual discovery, of which she only ever gets part. One highly
eroticized scene, for example, uses linking to cast the object of
Tracey's desire into doubt. Here, the 15-year-old Tracey performs a
gymnastics "beam routine" for an older man:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'_I don’t want to have sex_,’ I say. ‘Not with you.’
</p>

<p>
But then, not wanting to disappoint, ‘I could do my <span class="underline">beam routine</span>.’  
</p>

<p>
I take off my clothes and, fifteen, mount the line of the carpet to
perform my entire junior beam routine, handstand press, two
backhandsprings included. <span class="underline">He jerks off</span>. Dismount.  
</p>

<p>
I hurry into my clothes and head home to Vivian (_who loves me, but not
as much as I love her_). For years I worry that the shoe salesman was
really disappointed, <span class="underline">stuck with a fifteen year old virgin gymnast</span>
rather than a real bad girl. "Beamroutine8.htm"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The beam routine performance enacts a tension between touch and desire
that drives not only the narrative story but also the reader as she
clicks her way through the links. In compensating for the sex act, the
visual performance of beam routine suggests a desire that is
inaccessible to touch in two ways. First, on the level of narrative
form, the object of desire is cast into doubt by the phrase, "I don't
want to have sex, not with you," instead implying her friend Vivan, to
whom Tracey declares her love earlier in the episode ("Our third
daiquiris arrive and, my hand hot on her waist, "I tell her I love
her" (“beamroutine5.htm”)), as the object of desire. However, on the
level of format, desire's referent is destabilized by the text's
associative structure. The link to this same sentence, "I don't want
to have sex," leads to a page about another love object, Jennie
Winchester:
</p>
<div class="source">
<p>
I’m in bed with <span class="underline">Jennie</span> Winchester and I realize she wants me to undo
her pants. She needs to be home by 11:00 and needs to leave my place
by 10:45. I’m kissing her but opening my eyes at intervals to catch
the clock. At exactly 10:43 I unbutton her Levis and shove my hand
inside, barely undoing the zipper. “I’m in bed…”
</p>

</div>
<p>
The association between Jennie and Vivian, both of whom are depicted
as highly desirable partners throughout the work, and the phrase "I
don't want to have sex," throws Tracey's desire into doubt. The links
here create a disorienting effect where the reader constantly loses
context even as she familiarizes herself with the events of the
story. Here, the difficulty in "grasping" the story on a physical
level, on the level of format, in clicking through the various
episodes, continually proves desire to be a moving target on the level
of narrative form. The links thus reinforce a frustrated relationship
to touch across the work, where the reader clicks through a story she
will never fully grasp, to read a story about a desire that is never
fully defined. The reader’s confusion in navigating through <i>Waves</i>,
in re-interpreting fragments that had been previously integrated,
reinforces desire, and queer desire in particular, as something
elusive, a condition that is not fully intelligible.
</p>

<p>
I open with this work because it illustrates a foundational assumption
for this dissertation&#x2013;that digital media abstracts complex elements
of queer identity, desire, and experience in text into formal
possibilities for analysis. In <i>Waves</i>, for example, where desire is
distributed across a network structure, the network becomes a formal
device for exploring queer desire. This text puts into practice
post-structuralist principles about the destabilization and
de-centering of literary narrative in a continually branching network
that shifts and scrambles the reader's sense of direction.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
Despite this apparent disorder, however, movement across the text is
highly constrained by standards that rule all network connections,
what Alexander Galloway refers to as network "protocol." Protocol
operates mostly out of view, taking the form of technical standards
like HTML that control the connection between pages in the story. The
tension between this controlling structure and free movement within it
recalls a condition of the network where, according to Galloway,
"protocol is synonymous with possibility" (168). The same rules that
confine and determine movement can also be used to subvert expected
behavior in the network, to seek out what hackers call an exploit.
</p>

<p>
This project examines digital media for their constraints,
particularly the ways they abstract textual expressions of sex,
sexuality, and gender into digital forms. Then, I explore how these
constraints might engage theories and concepts from the field of Queer
Studies. The network story format as a controlling structure, for
example, shares in the same principles that also influence the
inception of Queer Studies with Judith Butler's <i>Gender Trouble:
Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i> in 1990. Butler's work
establishes a denaturalization of sex, gender, and sexuality, famously
exposing these categories as social constructions that precede and
determine subjectivity rather than express it.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Her work lays the
groundwork for Queer Studies's fixation with seeking out exploits that
make resistance possible within the matrix of power. Bringing this
fixation to <i>Waves</i>, I would explore how network dynamics engage
categories and norms that define and delineate sexuality in this
text. How might the subject, who into intelligibility through the matrix of
discourse, relate to protocol as a controlling structure?

<h3 id="org23f54a7"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> <i>Queer DH</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This work is situated within an emerging field at the intersection of
Digital Humanities (DH) and Queer Studies called <i>Queer DH</i>. While
much of DH scholarship is enticed by what Stephen Ramsay describes as
"the heightened objectivity made possible by the machine," or social
science methodologies that verify, correct, or establish knowledge,
Queer DH emphasizes instead how digital tools and methods might
productively complicate the stability and legibility of knowledge (x).
In doing so, Queer DH projects generally take one of two approaches:
the first imagines alternative digital tools that reflect the
complexity and nuances of real-world objects and phenomena, while the
second approach deconstructs and critiques existing tools, maintaining
that queerness is inherent to computational logic.
</p>

<p>
The first approach often consists of speculative or critical making
projects that do not work in a functional sense. Rather, these
projects problematize the constructed nature of technical objects. For
example, Zach Blas and micha cárdenas’s computer program,
<i>transCoder</i>, contains programming functions inspired by Queer Theory,
such as the "destabilizationLoop," which "breaks apart any process
that acts as a continuously iterating power," and "nonteleo()" which
"strips any program of a goal-oriented result"
("libraries.txt"). According to the authors, this pseudo-code project
explores how "cultural layer of queerness&#x2026; acts upon and mutates
mutually with the computer layer of algorithms, binary logic, data
structures, code, software, and digitization" ("about.txt"). Another
example of this speculative strand of Queer DH is "Queer OS," a
project that posits a theoretical operating system Kara Keeling's call
for an operating system "take[s] historical, sociocultural, conceptual
phenomena that currently shape our realities in deep and profound
ways, such as race, gender, class, citizenship, and ability&#x2026; to be
mutually constitutive with sexuality and with media and information
technologies" (Keeling, "Queer OS"). This operating system, which
imagines computational tools that "[do] not yet exist and may never
come to exist [&#x2026; do] not yet function and may never function"
includes an interface that "disappears but is not naturalized," and
"promiscuous" applications that "move and interact across platforms,
devices, users, and geographical regions unrestricted" (Barnett et
al). This project, the authors explain, goes beyond the desire to
understand the workings of computation: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While our queer impulse may be to explode this [black] box, to lay
bare its inner workings in a gesture of radical revelation, this
desire to access the truth of the machine in that hardware, those
circuits, these gates and switches is rooted in a drive toward depth,
essence, and resolution that is antithetical to a QueerOS&#x2026; a more
productive interface would be expansive, proliferating the
relationality allowed for by the inter-face, its inter-activity, its
nature as that which is between or among, that which binds together,
mutually or reciprocally. "Interface"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Speculative projects like <i>transCoder</i> and "Queer OS" share a
suspicion that the "drive toward depth" in deconstructive analysis
undermines the playful, elusive nature of a queer ethos.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to this speculative approach, another strand of Queer DH
explores how technological systems and tools already engage queer
concepts or methods of analysis. For example, work by Jacob Gaboury
explores how "NULL" values evoke a distinctly queer logic, a "refusal
to cohere, to become legible" (“Becoming NULL”). In database
computing, NULL values stand in place for data that is missing but
cannot be equated to zero, which represents a quantity of
nothing. The NULL value identifies a presence or existence without
giving any more information away, enacting simultaneously a "retreat
from representation sits at the heart of queerness," and "a queer
technics lying at the heart of the database form," ("Becoming
NULL"). Moving from the database to data formats, Textual scholar
Julia Flanders explores the "queerability" of the TEI (Text Encoding
Initiative), a "markup language" for adding descriptive tags to
textual data. Flanders deconstructs what she calls the data structure,
an ordered and branching hierarchical format with strict naming
conventions and boundaries for its data. Despite the rigidity of the
TEI structure, which requires discrete data, Flanders argues that it
offers a possibility for dissent, for expressing smooth information,
through nesting and customization. According to scholars like Gaboury
and Flanders, it is from within the structuring logics of computer
software itself that queerness finds the space to operate.
</p>

<p>
Cutting between these approaches, this project first takes a
deconstructive look at digital tools to seek out its constraint, that
is, an effect that reduces or collapses the nuances of queer identity
and experience into computable components. Then, I experiment with how
this reductive aspect might be re-worked to bring back the details of
queer identity and experience. Each chapter of my dissertation takes
up a different constraint and explores how it can be re-deployed to
reflect the multiplicity, fluidity, and dynamicity of queerness as it
has been theorized by Queer Studies. Here I take the necessary
disambiguation of programming logics and data structures, which
process literary text into fixed and legible formats, toward revealing
the complex and ambiguous forms of queer identity and experience. For
example, in my second chapter on the TEI, or "text encoding," I take
the rigid and hierarchical format of text encoding framework as an
opportunity to think productively about hierarchical power structures.
In the careful and minute work of encoding a text, where each element
of is tagged within a document hierarchy, the editor grapples against
the limitations of the compulsory categorization and containerization
of data. To work within the limitations of the document hierarchy, I
borrow from historiographical methods that represent absent or
obscured data within totalizing structures. This close and careful
work with text encoding allows me to make the connection between
hierarchical data structures and power dynamics, offering an
opportunity for rethinking my usage of the text encoding tool to
foreground that which has been excluded from the system.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
In order to seek out the computational constraints of each tool, this
work unpacks some common assumptions about software and data. The
first assumption is that software is politically neutral. Rather, as
my analysis attempts to demonstrate, software encodes social ideology,
specifically, hegemonic ideas for handling and organizing
difference. For example, Tara McPherson's work traces how the
operating system (OS), the foundational software that supports a
computer's basic functioning, develops alongside 1960s and 1970s
discourses on racial equality. She argues that "the organization of
information and capital" in OS development resonates in the
neoliberalist discourses that "distanc[ed] the overt racism of the
past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive radicalism"
(30). These systems, which partition and simplify complex processes
into discrete components, evoke the ways that identity politics
cordones off social groups into manageable units. While this
organization works for identity politics, it also suggests how
"Certain modes of racial visibility and knowing coincide or dovetail
with specific ways of organizing data" (McPherson 24). She offers an
example with the "rules" of UNIX (used to power MAC and Linux systems)
philosophy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. 
</p>

<p>
Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by
demonstration that nothing else will do. 
</p>

<p>
Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and
debugging easier&#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can
be stupid and robust. 26
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions, while the rules of "Transparency" and
"Representation" flatten nuance, ambiguity, and "raw" data into
legible forms. McPherson explains that these rules correspond to
ideological values for partitioning and organizing difference so that
components can be independently modified without affecting the whole
system. Moving to 21st century computing, hegemonic social ideologies
spread into data gathering, surveilliance, and quantification
practices. As computational power grows, the emphasis on efficiency
perpetuates social stratifications from previous eras. As Ruha
Benjamin asserts, "the road to inequity is paved with technical
fixes," where newer technologies reproduce bias and discrimination
under the guise of objectivity and progressivism (7). Benjamin
explores how innovations in tracking, labelling, and monetizing data
extend racist paradigms into new tools, such as databases for
financial services that associate "black names" with criminality
(Benjamin 5).<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> Neutrality works by obscuring the principles
driving tool development, as well as those who design and carry out
those principles. Benjamin explains that "bias enters through the
backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6).

Another assumption has to do with data. This project resists the
assumption that data can be gathered or processed in a "raw" or
unaltered state. Because data always undergoes a transformation from
real-world objects and phenomena into electronic format, its
complexity and nuance is always already compromised. As a result, data
structures like tabular and hierarchical formats represent data that
has already been reduced. As Johanna Drucker explains, each piece of
data carries with it the result of many interpretive decisions to
varying degrees of opacity: "the graphical presentation of supposedly
self-evident information&#x2026; conceals these complexities, and the
interpretative factors that bring the numerics into being, under a
guise of graphical legibility" (par. 23). To highlight the reductions
of data, a term that deceptively connotes that which is "given,"
Drucker proposes thinking of data as "capta," suggesting that which is
taken. Drucker experiments with turning graphical metrics like lines
and bars on a graph into expressive forms that break, blur, or bleed
into one another. Here, objects are not discrete entities, but
interact with the other objects in the visualization.

Unlike technological processes that seek to transform and manage
information about real-world objects and phenomena into computable
data, queer methods of analysis often seek to surface that which
eludes capture or categorization. This dissertation defines queerness
as an incommensurable quality that cannot be defined, captured, or
fixed. According to José Esteban Muñoz, queer subjectivity is defined
by a <i>gap</i> in identification, which he calls "disidentification,"
where subjectivity emerges in the failure to adhere to social
expectations (<i>Disidentifications</i> 5).<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Within this gap, minority
subjects find alternative pathways to connect with majority culture,
"read[ing] onesself and one's own life narrative in a moment, object,
or subject that is not culturally coded to 'connect' with the
disidentifying subject" (<i>Disidentifications</i> 12). The experience of
disidentification enables incommensurable elements of queerness to
surface. I take this term "incommensurable" from Latina feminist
philosopher Ofelia Schutte, who defines it as "a residue of meaning
that will not be reached in cross-cultural endeavors" (56). Drawing
from feminist postcolonial and poststructuralist concepts of alterity
and difference, Schutte theorizes ambiguity as politically potent tool
for cross-cultural communication. Schutte gives an example of how the
incommensurable emerges in conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In cross-cultural communication, each speaker may "say" something that
falls on the side of the "unsaid" for a culturally differentiated
interlocutor. Such gaps in communication may cause one speaker's
discourse to appear incoherent or insufficiently organized. To the
culturally dominant speaker, the subaltern speaker's discourse may
appear to be a string of fragmented observations rather than a unified
whole. 62
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The point of isolating incommensurability is not to try to grasp or
translate the vestige of lost meaning, but to recognize that gap as a
space that constitutes queer experience and subjectivity. Schutte
proposes that one embrace the strangeness of communication, attending
to gaps and elisions, to the ways in which, for example, "the other's
speech, or some aspect of it, resonates&#x2026; as a kind of strangeness,
as a kind of displacement of the usual expectation" (56). As a moment
of failure, where meaning does not transfer, incommensurability
describes a productive effect of the embodied experience of
disidentificaiton. At its most extreme, incommensurability can
manifest as what Chicana theorist Gloria Anzaldúa describes as <i>el
choque</i>, a bodily experience of collision between two opposing
forces. In the experience of the choque, the subject receives opposing
cultural messages that incite a physical upheaval. Such moments of
incommensurability, from the subtle and strange to the tumultuous,
enable queerness to retain a quality of elusiveness&#x2013;an elusiveness
which cannot be measured, which resists the capture of technological
protocols and processes.

This dissertation poses the incommensurable qualities of queer
identity and experience against the necessary disambiguiation of
technological processes. First, through digital methods like text
analysis, text encoding, and media archaeology (discussed in more
detail below), I seek out aspects of queerness that resist the
transformation between technical registers, aspects that are
constituted through lack or displacement. Then, I explore how digital
tools might be reworked to engage with this resistance. To handle
forms that resist this transformation, I combine the concepts of
"deformance" from Digital Studies with "queer form" from Queer
Studies. Deformance, coined by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels,
describes the act of distorting, disordering, or re-assembling
literary material, with the goal of estranging the reader from their
familiarity of the text. McGann and Samuels explain that while
electronic formats reduce complex literary elements into to computable
components, they also confront the reader with new opportunities for
analysis. By continually subscribing the text to new configurations,
digital tools expose the semantic potentialities of the text's latent
aspects, a quality that McGann refers to as a text's "quantum
poetics," explaining that, "Aesthetic space is organized like quantum
space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements making up the space are
perceived to shift and change, even reverse themselves, when measures
of attention move across discrete quantum levels" (McGann 183). This
project uses deformance to surface a text's "queer form," a term I
borrow from Kadji Amin, Amber Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez to
describe "an aesthetics that moves persistently around the visual,"
"mak[ing] difference a little less knowable, visible, digestible"
(235). Queer form, according to these theorists, "resist[s] the
dictates of transparency normally required of non-normative subjects
by illuminating the unseen" (233). My work seeks out such forms that
figure the contour, boundary, and edge around the elusive identities,
repressed desires, and other coded elements of queerness in text.
</p>

<p>
My dissertation includes a digital component that demonstrates in
practice how these tools reveal, not solutions for understanding or
"fixing" queerness, but opportunities for exploring its shifting
permutations. As a practical application of my research, this digital
component, called the <i>Queer Text Toolkit</i>, explores the interpretive
possibilities of text analysis and text encoding procedures. Here,
users can experiment firsthand with how reductive digital formats and
processes, which collapse stylistic and formal expressions of gender,
sex, and sexuality into computable data, can be redeployed toward
creative exploration. The project consists of two applications, "queer
distant reading" and "queer text encoding," which correspond to my
first two chapters on text analysis and text encoding,
respectively. The "queer distant reading" application is a
command-line application that walks users through text analysis
procedures inspired by Judith Butler’s theory of gender
performativity. Here, users experience firsthand how the process of
iterating over text, which is central to text analysis tasks, draws
from Butler’s formulation of gender as a series of repeated acts that
destabilize binary structures of gender. The application consists of a
Python module containing scripts for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and
visualizing the text which builds from Python libraries for Natural
Language Processing and network analysis. The "queer text encoding"
tool offers an interactive and beginner-friendly Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) workflow for "marking up" homoerotic content in
text. The website interface encourages readers to think productively
about the limitations of discrete labeling protocols and how this work
engages with critical debates about recovery work. The tools consists
of a JavaScript-based web application containing a transcribed and
encoded manuscript of a portion of Oscar Wilde’s <i>The Picture of
Dorian Gray</i>, which Wilde edited to remove suggestions of
homoeroticism. Aimed at an audience of humanist scholars at the
beginning of their technical training, the toolkit offers a blueprint
that lowers the barrier to entry for educators and students using
digital tools to work with queer literature.

Besides offering new digital procedures for studying textual material,
my work also considers how Queer Studies theorizes the relationship
between sex, gender, sexuality, and race. The order of chapters in my
dissertation follows a trajectory for the field of Queer Studies that
increasingly grapples with the role of race in queer identity. My
first chapter on text analysis considers early formulations of
queerness as a discursive phenomenon, exemplified by Judith Butler’s
theory of gender performativity, which was heavily critiqued for
eliding the lived realities of queer embodiment. My second chapter, on
text encoding, weighs various historiographical approaches for
handling absent or obscured elements of the archive. It compares
approaches from queer historiography fand the archive of slavery,
which offer strategies for resisting neoliberal narratives of
"progress" in the wake of mainstream LGBTQ acceptance. My last
chapter, energized by Black and Chicana Feminist thinking that powers
much of Queer of Color Critique, embarks on a close reading of
electronic materiality to explore the role of sensuality in
racialization.
</p>

<p>
My first chapter, "'A Melon, an Emerald, a Fox in the Snow':
Quantifying Gender in Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando: A Biography</i>,"
examines how computational text analysis grapples with gender ontology
in Woolf's novel, <i>Orlando</i>, which features a transgender
protagonist. The chapter begins by tracing how the adoption of
quantitative methods to analyze gender in Literary Studies perpetuates
assumptions of gender as binary. I contrast this "reproducible"
approach with more experimental ones that use quantitative methods to
deconstruct social categories of gender and race. Then, the middle
portion of the chapter draws connections between computer programming
and gender theory. First, it delves into the python programming
language, focusing on the principle of iteration that drives cleaning
and regularizing tasks, as well as the transformation of words into
numerical representations for quantitative processing, with the goal
of bringing out the iterative quality of working with python code. It
then moves to Judith Butler’s concept of gender performativity, which
posits how gender expression might subvert traditional social
structures through repeatedly "performing" gender constraints in ways
that deviate from the norm. Taking this shared quality of iteration
between python and gender, I propose a text analysis methodology that
interweaves, or iterates through, distant and close reading. Turning
to Woolf’s text, I demonstrate how this method of text analysis leads
to a plurality of significations for gender terms in the novel,
revealing how language and gender are closely coordinated in the
narrative. I conclude by considering the limitations of this method,
which poses gender as a discursive phenomenon, and its place within a
larger trajectory of Gender Studies since Butler's text, which
inaugurated the field.
</p>

<p>
My second chapter, "'Where there is Spectacular Passion, they would
Suggest Something Vile': Encoding Queer Erasure in Oscar Wilde’s <i>The
Picture of Dorian Gray</i>" explores the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
standard, an electronic editing tool that allows researchers to "mark
up," or tag, textual elements, to encode the homoerotic elements that
Wilde edited during his revisions of <i>Dorian Gray</i> (1890). My analysis
in this section finds that the TEI works best with data which is
discrete and bounded, rather than smooth data. Like my critique of
text analysis, this computational constraint reveals a connection to
queerness: As a labeling tool, the TEI surfaces moments where queer
themes, which are plural and permeable in this text, threaten to spill
over the bounds of its data structure. I close this first section by
proposing a custom editorial workflow that encourages editors to tag
the homoerotic elements in a way that surfaces some of their
elusiveness. Finally, in an extended conclusion, I delve deeper into
the mutually reinforcing nature of dominance structures across data
formats and text encoding practices. Here, I draw from Queer of
Color's Critique on Queer Studies and Black Feminist scholarship on
the archive of slavery to energize a radical re-thinking of editorial
practices. I close by highlighting examples of current TEI projects
that deploy collaborative and minimalist practices to challenge the
structuring modes of textual editing and the TEI data format.
</p>

<p>
Whereas the first two chapters are about deconstructing digital tools
for text analysis and text encoding, my third chapter, "Sex, Flesh,
Skin: A Media Archaeological Reading of <i>Dawn</i> and <i>skinonskinonskin</i>"
engages a close reading of electronic media. This chapter juxtaposes
two unlikely texts—-a hypertext work from 1999, <i>skinonskinonskin</i> by
<i>Entropy8Zuper!</i>, and a science fiction novel from 1987, <i>Dawn</i> by
Octavia Butler—-to unpack the role of media and mediation across
technological and physiological systems. Though these works present
vastly different narrative worlds, not to mention physical formats,
they both trouble the boundary between materiality and abstraction, in
one case through stacks of computer hardware and software, and in
another through depictions of bodily and mental processes. My analysis
takes the concept of materiality, expressed by hardware and human
flesh, as a ground for understanding how physical registers interact
with symbolic ones. Drawing from thinkers in Chicanx Studies and Black
Feminist Studies, I explore how sensuality across media environments
might suggest a capacious mode for theorizing new forms of social
relation.
</p>

<p>
Moving from language to embodiment, my proposed trajectory of Queer
Studies strategically poses queerness as something that eludes
definition, representation, or recovery. For queerness, as Muñoz
argues, is "not yet here," but perpetually on the horizon (1). At the
end of this project, queerness remains a target beyond reach, a fount
for future subversions, exemplified with the term "queer" itself,
which Butler famously says is "never fully owned, but always and only
redeployed, twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction
of urgent and expanding political purposes" (173). Emphasizing the
nebulous and shifting nature of this term, this work offers an
approach for studying queer texts that does not fully circumscribe to
a general methodology. The goal, as I try to demonstrate with the
<i>Queer Text Toolkit</i> application, is not to build reproducible schemas
and models for analyzing queerness. Rather, it is to harness opacity
and unintelligibility as resources for resisting inclusion into what
Muñoz describes as "the ossifying effects of neoliberal ideology"
(22). My project therefore posits queer form as a kind of technology
of resistance, which digital tools can help to surface. I hope this
experimental work will encourage the further developments for reading
our queer literary heritage, that, as Butler says, "begin, without
ending, without mastering, to own—and yet never fully to own—the
exclusions by which we proceed" (25).
