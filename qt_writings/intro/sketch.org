** Rough outline for chapter:

*** DONE hook - /Waves/
    CLOSED: [2023-07-06 Thu 11:38]
- Hyperlink structure: associative but also disorienting on a formal
  level (creating structure while disrupting causal
  relations/progress). 
- In playing with this narrative elusiveness, the links **reinforce a
  frustrated relationship to touch** operating in two levels in the
  work, where the reader clicks through a narrative to encounter a
  story she will never fully grasp, to read a story about a desire
  that is never fully satisfied. 
  - Thinking more deeply about hyperlink structure and the kind of
    formal possibilities it creates, how it draws from poststructural
    ideas about decentralization, nonlinearity, contingency, deferral
    of meaning.

*** DONE intervention
    CLOSED: [2023-07-06 Thu 11:38]
- Digital processes reduce complexity of queerness 
- But they can be reworked
- When computation and coding start to determine how we engage with
  texts, what kinds of analysis or experience do they make possible? A
  question I will return to at the end of this introduction.

*** DONE Queer DH
    CLOSED: [2023-07-07 Fri 11:43]
- Tension: is queerness inherent to digital tools, or do we need to
  work it into the tool?
- Where is queerness located in the digital? 

*** DONE the digital is reductive 
    CLOSED: [2023-07-08 Sat 11:53]
- history of interface: tools are not neutral (McPherson, Benjamin)
- in DH, raw data as unknowable: something we cannot fully grasp


*** DONE queer subjects and affects
    CLOSED: [2023-07-10 Mon 12:49]
- Queerness is an incommensurable quality, begins with a feeling if
  "disidentification" - a feeling of difference from the majority,
  which manifests as a choque. 
- the incommensurable is that which cannot be pinned down. 
- The choque opens a site for engaging with the disambiguation of the
  machine.  

*** DONE Queer Form: reductive but reworkable
    CLOSED: [2023-07-10 Mon 12:49]
- "queer form": digital abstraction amplifies the sensual
- (from proposal) the digital reduces complexity, evacuates queerness,
  but can also be reworked.

*** chapter trajectory
- critique of race, implicit whiteness
- discursivity -> affect -> embodiment.
- Affect studies not enough.
- future of queer studies: a target beyond reach. Strategic dynamism,
  fluidity.

In Queer Studies, non-normative bodies and desires have been theorized
into formal conceptualizations of performativity, negativity, affect,
and flesh, to name a few. These theorizations are abstractions--they
are schemas--created to figure the possibility of resistance against
the oppressive forces that drive heteronormative society.

*** sensual fullness of a lack
- Returning to the question about /Waves/: How does its structure
  relate to queerness? 
- A lack of fulfillment/total understanding draws on this idea that
  queerness strategically lacks a teleology.
    - Insert: /Confessions/ reading?
    - Munoz: queerness is not here. Queerness is a structuring mode of
      desiring. 
    - What does this gain us? A way of reading touch that is more
      concerned with exploring the potential of a touch rather than
      verifiable contact. The sensual fullness of a lack. 

TEXT:

The reader’s confusion in navigating through /Waves/, in
re-interpreting fragments that had been previously integrated,
reinforces desire, and queer desire in particular, as something
elusive, a condition that is not fully intelligible. Clicking
(touching) her way through the narrative, the reader is repeatedly
reminded of her removal from the story, in her inability to grasp the
story. This work thus literalizes the connection between touch, its
frustration, and queer desire.

It is interesting that this medium makes the story accessible through
touch (the “click” on the hyperlinks) while not giving full visual
access to the individual narratives like a traditional print work
(which is a phenomenon exaggerated in the ticker tape). 

** diss workshop notes
*** 9.2.20: Overview for diss workshop
Touching,'" lays out what Digital Humanities methodologies might learn
from Queer Theory. This chapter looks at specific reading practices by
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Heather Love, which question the proper
relationship of the critic to the object of study. Sedgwick's ideas
about "touching/feeling" and Love's notion of "touching without
touching" pose queer modes of relationality that do not presume full
connections as prerequisite for analysis. This chapter engages these
techniques with various critical methods from the Digital Humanities,
including distant, surface, and post-critical reading, and
deformative, algorithmic, and speculative criticism. I pay particular
attention to how digital formats and interfaces might facilitate queer
critical methods, and I speculate on the intimate process of engaging
with literature on a computer, where users can manipulate and
transform text in virtually infinite and unique ways. Comparing three
very different kinds of digital projects based on text manipulation,
including the text analysis web application /Voyant-Tools/, the text
encoding archive, /Women Writers Online/, and a hypertext novella by
Caitlin Fischer, /These Waves of Girls/, I explain how these tools
work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what Jerome McGann calls a
“prosthetic extension of that demand for critical reflection,” by
which the reader is able to feel her way through the text (18). In
particular, I find that the haptic and exploratory activity of working
with these tools enlivens the reading process by allowing the reader
to play, experiment, and imagine new connections to the textual
object.

*** 11.4.20: Overview for diss Workshop

This chapter--- at the most basic level--- is *an exploration of
distant reading methods*, and how distant reading methodology can
*function within a queer studies ethic*. Not even function, but how
they can align and do mutually reinforcing work. 

I begin by looking into the *parallels in the way that queerness and
data are treated*, in how they are both highly constructed,
"structured" according to dominant cultural assumptions. A lot of this
is because they are handled discursively. 

    - for queer theory, also because of the attempts to "redeem" or
      "resolve" queer experience & suffering. (I'm still working on
      the of this section, bringing the two into alignment).

    - for digital humanities, and this is the part that I sent you,
      which is a critique of certain strains of distant reading. This
      section is basically to say that some practitioners are not
      being critical enough about their data and methods. 

Then, the solution I propose---to approach these concepts from an
affective standpoint. To pay attention to the body, embodiment, touch,
sensation. (which will later come out in emphasis on speculation,
play, etc in distant reading)

The bulk of the chapter looks at distant reading that is aware of its
methodology. I propose some examples that emphasize *performativity*,
*opacity*, and *provisionality*. 

    - Performance: this is using *distant reading in a speculative way*,
      to where the process is more important than the
      product. Visualizations are supposed to be "played" rather than
      "explained".
        - To demonstrate this value in practice, I turn to the work of
          Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement, building off Jerome
          McGann, "imagining what we don't know". Also builds of
          Barad's ideas of quantum entanglement to discuss how critics
          are entangled with their objects of study.

    - Views/Opacities: about using distant reading to find what has
      been ignored/silenced. Looking specifically for the gaps in the
      record, what Klein calls "the image of absence". Looking at ways
      that categories co-constitute each other. Richard Jean So:
      Whiteness is only coherent when you compare it to blackness.

    - Provisionality: (not really relevant to distant reading, more in
      other methods like text encoding). The idea that metadata/tags
      must make room for the provisional, the shifting. 


VERY BRIEFLY: this section emphasizes that we need to be critical
    of distant reading tools for the way they reduce/transform
    data. This introspection will lead to more interesting
    interventions.


** intro to touch as reading method 
This section establishes the condition of being continually thwarted,
frustrated, eluded, as an affect of suspension or displacement that is
central to the experience of queerness, an affect called the
"untouchable."

*** touch intersects queer and digital, abstracting sense
At the intersection of queerness and the digital, touch operates by
abstracting its object through the intermediary of the sensible. This
process of abstraction compensates for the core condition of
queerness, which is untouchable, unknowable, and inexpressible.

*** /Waves/: queerness (story) is frustrating closure, eluding touch
The reader’s confusion in navigating through /Waves/ relates to the
work’s central theme of narration as seduction, piquing the reader's
interest in the story, propelling her through hyperlinks across the
various nodes, and repeatedly frustrating her desire for closure or
resolution, in a way that reinforces an approach toward queerness as
something elusive, a process that will never be complete.
 
*** Munoz's queerness as lack
Because queerness is "not yet here," it calls for something else,
expanding sensibility of feeling to include sensations beyond the
immediate, the readily sensible.

*** /confessions/: queerness and the denial of touch
In /Confessions/, maintaining the gap between sight and touch
stimulates the senses beyond what's possible within normative
expectations of sexual desire.


** the problem: queerness as untouchable, overreading
- This section deconstructs the state of queerness as being
  untouchable. 

Disidentification brings on a class of affects which point to the
element of incommensurability. We need to approach the incommensurable
as something that cannot be complete.

We conclude here that the proper position is hesitation, restraint. An
awareness of the need for hesitation, while also embracing
embodiment. The challenge is to regain touch without resolving it.

How do we touch without presuming full connections? We see Anzaldua's
standing at both sides at once, and Love's touching at a distance.

*** toward a reading method of the untouchable
This chapter will unpack a reading method that approaches queerness as
being "untouchable."

*** DisID points to the incommensurable: schutte 
Minority subjects struggle to be read into majoritarian systems of
identification, and rather experience disidentification, which
manifests as a choque, a collision of feelings, revealing an
incommensurable element, which cannot be resolved or verified.

*** TODO draft reading tries to resolve incommens
The illusion that we can gain sufficient knowledge into queer
experience, that such experiences are “commensurable,” drives certain
reading practices that critics describe as “paranoid” or “suspicious.

Visibility is a trap -- violence?

*** TODO revise paraonoia: sedgwick
Paranoid reading practices deliver results that are imaginable within
given knowledge structures, and close out other opportunities for
analysis.

*** TODO draft Scott & Kazanjian on overreading
the way that literary critics approach vision vs other fields

*** Paranoia and replication: haraway
We find parallels in epistemological methods from disciplines of
science (anthro) in which paranoia replicates assumptions. 

*** TODO add Barad on replication / representationalism
Barad makes a point about sciences being driven by replication. My
inquiry intersects with feminist scientific efforts

*** TODO refine paranoia and recovery: hartmann
For the historian of slavery, recovery is impossible within the terms
(language) of the dominant culture---schutte's incommensurability:
language cannot approximate the reality of experience.

*** Heather Love's queerness as failure, impossible
For Love, identification is about finding the moment when the subject
turns away: "Queer history has been an education in absence" (50.)
This moment of turning away characterizes queerness as something raw,
which cannot be captured.

*** TODO revise hesitation, critical distance is necessary: lowe
To avoid paranoid methods we develop a critical distance, we turn to
the ways that "touch" can be distanced. 

*** TODO revise the dimensions of touch: anzaldua
The challenge is to regain touch without resolving it, to touch
without presuming full connections
    
*** TODO refine /feeling backward/, touching at a distance 
Love offers a model of "feeling backward" which is a way for critics
to connect with queer subjects in a way that keeps objects out of the
critic's reach. 


** solution: abstraction, formalization, opacity
The harm of paranoia comes from a subject/object divide, where one
takes control/dominance over the other. But what if we found
alternative ways of making connections? This involves play and
speculation. It involves /formalizing what cannot be touched/ into a
touchable format. Playing with vantages, provisionality, performance!

*** TODO refine reparative reading is active
looking at reading as reparative opens up the way we understand
epistemology as about movement and performance, rather than
knowledge. 

*** TODO cut Waves on movement/performance/ ./
As I follow this disorienting narrative, I similarly enter into cycles
of desire and frustration. This affective reaction is only possible
through the formal structure of the narrative. 

*** TODO draft QPOC on opacity, recuperating absence
Hartmen's "critical fabulation" & Amber Musser's "surface aesthetics":
POC theorists have shown us how subjectivity is never quite
attainable, exists on a surface level. 

*** TODO add Confessions on opacity
the marbled page as an example of what cannot be said. Formal
experiments to present a self that is multiple, fragmented,
unreachable. We can only play with the pieces.
*** TODO revise invisibility is good, allows queers avoid being seen
As disidentified, queer subjects remain outside of the confines of the
visible. To gain visibility within the dominant system only reproduces
visibility within the terms of that system. 

*** TODO draft Toward a Queer Form
Writing the self is connected to form. Always. The form is
multiple. The form makes subjectivity opaque, but in the act of
abstraction, making it opaque, we can touch it and play around with
it. 

*** TODO draft Frontera on vitality to deformance?
the book as living and structured -- we are touching an abstraction

--> signposting: will see the equivalent of touching distantly in
deformance.


** on reproducible criticism
This section sets up the conversation about how digital methods
evacuate complexity and difference, by going into the history of
technological development and revealing the assumptions and values
encoded into the technology. It then takes a critical look at some
examples of distant reading to see how they simmilarly perpetuate
their users' assumptions. This practice is contrasted with
DH practitioners like Drucker who deliberately skew metrics and
equivocate the results from analysis.

The argument is that some distant reading practitioners do not take a
critical enough stance toward their data and methods. That they
overlook the ways that they collapse their data into whatever best
fits their needs, that they make reductions and transformations.

*** contextualize development of digital tech
This section presents a narrative of technological history that
emphasizes how innovations come out of cultural assumptions and are
more about perpetuating current systems of control than reaching
toward new ones.

The internet is more about control than freedom. A technology credited
with democratizing information, communication, and access actually
arose from a national security consideration, to improve military
communication. Since then, the internet stealthily works to
standardize communication and expose its users to data gathering.

Operating systems, which make possible the running of computers, are
built by white men and display their cultural values in the ways that
they want to simplify complex problems.  

Today, the development of surveillance tech furthers this legacy,
presenting blackness as something marked or other to whiteness. 

*** Underwood reproduces assumptions about binary gender
Assuming gender as a binary concept will create relationships of
opposition, a case in point of how the critic's entanglement
bakes results into analysis.
