* My critical approach

Chapter one: 

- Critique of Distant Reading, "falsifiable criticism" which is
  "reproducible". And generative reading of DR that attends to the
  ways that computation can access marginalization.

- Judith Butler's idea of performativity and how it aligns with
  iterativity in Python. Bringing these two together allows us to
  understand how gender theory can open up the way we think about text
  analysis.

---> to this, I might add a discussion of 

Chapter two:

- Critique of Textual Editing, which asserts that the goal of the
  editor is to bring to the surface the intentions of the author. 

- Critique of Queer Historiography, which debates the extent to which
  historians can know or label queerness in the past.

- Heather Love's idea of "feeling backward," to account for queer
  affects without attempting to pin them down, redeem them. 

---> to this, I might add a discussion of Queer Negativity, and a
     meditation on the role of trauma in creating queerness.
