This dissertation looks at new ways of reading queer bodies and
experience within technological contexts. How do digital tools and
platforms change the way we interact with affect (associated with
queer experience) within texts? What about the digital allows us to
create sensational reading experiences? Kn other words, how does media
touch us, and how might we touch what we read?

This chapter proposes a reading methodology that leverages the
critic's relation to the text to open possibilities for interpretation
and connections to the textual material. It explores the ways that
reading practices across two different fields intertwine, and how this
creates a new method for reading queer narratives in digital
contexts. 

** not overdetermining queer subjects
In some queer theory and digital humanities runs a similar hesistation
not to overdetermine the content of what we read. For queer theory,
this hesitation pushes against the trend of finding pain in order to
redeem it. This reading practice (also known as "suspicious reading")
seeks to expose prohibition and repression, sometimes with the goal of
affirming queer subjects or recuperating their losses. Reading is
oriented around revealing these aspects about queer experience---the
pain and shame of the closet, for example---and turning those aspects
into sites of political resistance, liberation, or pride.

** Heather Love's /Feeling Backward/
In resisting the temptations to redeem or console psychic suffering,
Heather Love offers an alternative reading strategy,
"feeling-backward." This strategy allows queer subjects to remain with
their bad feelings. She focuses on feelings such as "nostalgia,
regret, shame, despair, ressentiment, passivity escapism, self-hatred,
withdrawal, bitterness, defeatism, and loneliness," which are tied to
"the historical impossibility of same-sex desire" (4). She examines
the burdened protagonists from famous modernist texts like Walter
Pater's /The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry/ (1873), Radclyffe
Hall's /The Well of Loneliness/ (1928), Willa Cather's /My √Åntonia/
(1918). Love argues that the shame and stigma experienced by these
characters ought to be reclaimed rather than resolved. Instead of
turning negative histories into sites of resistance or affirmation,
these hurting characters ought to have reign over their own
darkness. And this darkness must be where the critic will meet them.

Reading, for Love, is a "play of recognitions" (CITATION). A way of
identifying, but not fully. Fully identifying would be a
consolation. Rather, Love looks to the ways that identity unsettles
and shatters. This mode of relationality does not presume a full
connection between the critic and subject. In doing so, it opens up
possibilities for understanding, recognition, play, experimentation. 

** how do deal with assimilation 
For those that would argue that negative feelings are no longer
relevant in today's world, Love responds that the advent of
assimilation, of popular acceptance, only creates more problems for a
group that has come into being as abject. /(the corrolary for digital
studies is the proliferation of data, of information, digitization)/
Queer assimilation and apparent rise in acceptance across popular
culture and mass media contradicts the reality of shame and stigma
that everyday queers experience, a contradiction that breeds ever more
shame: "Of course, same-sex desire is not as impossible as it used to
be; as a result, the survival of feelings such as shame, isolation,
and self-hatred into the post-Stonewall era is often the occasion for
further feelings of shame. The embarrassment of owning such feelings,
out of place as they are in a movement that takes pride as its
watchword, is acute" (4). What do we do with these residual feelings
of shame?

How should queer criticism orient itself? Love shows that critics face
a contradiction, brought on by the reality of negative feelings and
psychic costs of being queer in a homophobic society. The narrative
trajectory of queer progress runs counter to the residual pain of
being queer. Criticism is stuck in the middle of this ambivalence,
between affirming its pride and bemoaning its suffering: "We are not
sure if we should explore the link between homosexuality and loss, or
set about proving that it does not exist" (Love 3).
