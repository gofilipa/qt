This dissertation looks at new ways of reading queer bodies and
experience within technological contexts. How do digital tools and
platforms change the way we interact with affect (associated with
queer experience) within texts? What about the digital allows us to
create sensational reading experiences? In other words, how does media
touch us, and how might we touch what we read?
</p>

<p>
This chapter proposes a reading methodology that leverages the
critic's relation to the text to open possibilities for interpretation
and connections to the textual material. It explores the ways that
reading practices across two different fields intertwine, and how this
creates a new method for reading queer narratives in digital
contexts.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-1">
<p>
In some queer theory and digital humanities runs a similar hesistation
not to overdetermine the content of what we read. For queer theory,
this hesitation pushes against the trend of locating or identifying
with pain in order to redeem it or expose its workings. This reading
practice (which has been called "suspicious reading" or "paranoid
reading"<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>) seeks to expose prohibition and repression, often with
the goal of affirming queer subjects or recuperating their
losses. Reading is oriented around revealing these aspects about queer
experience (the pain and shame of the closet, for example) and turning
those aspects into sites of political resistance, liberation, or
pride. [NEEDS A QUOTE, SEDGWICK, THAT EXPLAINS PARANOID READING]

<h3 id="org567b5d3"><span class="section-number-3">0.2</span> Heather Love's <i>Feeling Backward</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-2">
<p>
In resisting the temptations to redeem or console psychic suffering,
Heather Love offers an alternative reading strategy,
"feeling-backward." This strategy opens a space for bad feelings
without trying to recuscitate, justify, or transform them. She focuses
on feelings such as "nostalgia, regret, shame, despair,
<i>ressentiment</i>, passivity escapism, self-hatred, withdrawal,
bitterness, defeatism, and loneliness," which, according to Love, are
tied to "the historical impossibility of same-sex desire" (4, emphasis
original). She examines the burdened protagonists from famous
modernist texts like Walter Pater's <i>The Renaissance: Studies in Art
and Poetry</i> (1873), Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of Loneliness</i> (1928),
Willa Cather's <i>My Ántonia</i> (1918), and Sylvia Townsend Warner's
<i>Summer Will Show</i>. Love argues that the shame and stigma experienced
by these characters ought to be recognized rather than
resolved. Instead of turning negative histories into sites of
resistance or affirmation, these hurting characters might have full
reign over their own darkness. And this darkness must be where the
critic will meet them.

<h4 id="org6e008d5"><span class="section-number-4">0.2.1</span> identification is risky</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-0-2-1">
<p>
As readers, identifying with literary subjects is dangerous and
seducticve. Identities within texts are not stable across time and
place, and acts of identification might collapse or overlook the
complexity of experience. For queer readers in particular,
identification often emerges from a desire to recognize something that
affirms queer experience in the present. Love describes queer critics,
"Like demanding lovers [who] promise to rescue the past when in fact
they dream of being rescued themselves" (33). Reading in this sense is
a search for community, for similitude, a link between past and
present. When identification is possible, however, it can be
shattering. In "The Torment of Queer Literature," Kelly Caldwell
explains the quandry of reading James Baldwin's <i>Giovanni's Room</i> as a
transgender woman: "what if the only available act of identification
is one of stigma and shame? Embracing queerness is often embracing
abjection. Sometimes identification is loss and despair" (par. 4). For
many readers, the more redemptive or celebratory narratives offer no
consolation. Caldwell explains the choice: "Either read a book like
Giovanni’s Room at the risk of recognizing David’s denial and
repression as my own, or read a book that celebrates queer lives and
sex boldly and end up despising my own cowardice" (par. 17).
</p>

<h4 id="orge202d2d"><span class="section-number-4">0.2.2</span> queerness is a failed project, which is why it's so tempting.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-0-2-2">
<p>
The more hopeless and resistant queer subjects make for more tempting
identifications. Love explains how these subjects remain beyond the
reader's grasp: "As queer readers we tend to see ourselves as reaching
back toward isolated figures in the queer past in order to rescue or
save them. It is hard to know what to do with texts that resist our
advances" (8). The reason that these subjects remain so unreachable
has to do with the nature of queerness itself, which represents
absence, loss, and failure. Love illustrates this quality by evoking a
Greek myth, Orpheus and Eurydice, in which the lover botches his
beloved's rescue by looking back at her as they exit the
underworld. Love quotes from Maurice Blanchot's account of the story
in "The Gaze of Orpheus," to describe what Orpheus searches for in the
prohibited and doomed glance backward:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Not to look would be infidelity to the measureless, imprudent force
of his movement, which does not want Eurydice in her daytime truth and
in her everyday appeal, but wants her in her nocturnal obscurity, in
her distance, with her closed body and sealed face&#x2014;wants to see her
not when she is visible, but when she is invisible, and not as the
intimacy of familiar life, but as the foreignness of what excludes all
intimacy, and wants, not to make her live, but to have living in her
the plenditude of death" (50).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Orpheus's downfall is his desire for a glimpse at what cannot be
grapsed, what remains beyond the light. This desire is not for
"daytime truth" but for "noctural obscurity," which is always receding
at the moment of pursuit. Like Eurydice, queerness emerges only to
slip away, turning its face from the parched gaze. Can we be blamed
for looking for that which cannot be grasped? No, because queerness
has always been structured by that which is not, by what Love calls
"impossible love" (24). She reminds us that "Queer history has been an
education in absence" (50). In learning failure and loss, queer
readers can only identify with what they have been taught to recognize
as untouchable. Full identification, like Eurydice in the daylight, is
prevented by design.
</p>

<h4 id="orga3fa7eb"><span class="section-number-4">0.2.3</span> identifying, but not fully. HERE:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-0-2-3">
<p>
Love proposes a way out of the quandry: "Rather than attempt to
'overcome' identity, I want to suggest a mode of historiography that
recognizes the inevitability of a 'play of recogniztions,' but that
also sees these recognitions not as consoling but as shattering"
(45). Reading, for Love, can enact a "play of recognitions," that is,
a way of identifying, but not fully. Full identification would be a
consolation, redemptive. Rather, Love looks to the ways that identity
unsettles and dissolves.
</p>


<p>
This mode of relationality does not presume a
full connection between the critic and subject. In doing so, it opens
up possibilities for understanding, recognition, play,
experimentation.

<h3 id="orge82e270"><span class="section-number-3">0.3</span> data reduction / queer assimilation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-3">
<p>
For those that would argue that negative feelings are no longer
relevant in today's world, Heather Love responds that the advent of
assimilation, of popular acceptance, only creates more problems for a
group that has come into being as abject. <i>(the corrolary for digital
studies is the proliferation of data, of information, digitization)</i>
Queer assimilation and apparent rise in acceptance across popular
culture and mass media contradicts the reality of shame and stigma
that everyday queers experience, a contradiction that breeds ever more
shame: "Of course, same-sex desire is not as impossible as it used to
be; as a result, the survival of feelings such as shame, isolation,
and self-hatred into the post-Stonewall era is often the occasion for
further feelings of shame. The embarrassment of owning such feelings,
out of place as they are in a movement that takes pride as its
watchword, is acute" (4). What do we do with these residual feelings
of shame?
</p>

<p>
How should queer criticism orient itself? Love shows that critics face
a contradiction, brought on by the reality of negative feelings and
psychic costs of being queer in a homophobic society. The narrative
trajectory of queer progress runs counter to the residual pain of
being queer. Criticism is stuck in the middle of this ambivalence,
between affirming its pride and bemoaning its suffering: "We are not
sure if we should explore the link between homosexuality and loss, or
set about proving that it does not exist" (Love 3).
