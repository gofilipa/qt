"Spend more time on these exciting questions around the limitations of
TEI, and on the topics in the last section and conclusion. Not much
space is given to the TEI approach the author is using in Wilde’s text
in comparison to the other sections, and what the author’s original
customisation of TEI achieves. I would suggest a reframing of the
article to focus more on how the tagging releases textual meanings
within this text in reference to Wilde’s revisions, how TEI offers new
methods to read these revisions and their potential forms, how the
themes that characterise the revisions operate and contribute to the
markup, and how this visualises queer form and its slippery affects or
coded elements within the text. The close attention to the varied
physical pen strokes and marks on the pages within Wilde’s revisions
and the parallels with the conceptual homoerotic elements of the edits
is highly interesting and would benefit from more exploration within
the article."

While the author’s central research question (Julia Flanders’ do we
need to queer markup or is markup already queerable?) is clear and
effectively explored, article would benefit from clearer illustration

Similarly, the author makes too much use of phrases such as “Now I
turn…” (p.7) and “Now I will describe…” (p.20). These are unnecessary
filler phrases and make the article feel over-signposted at

Literary and textual scholars have long speculated over Wilde's
intentions as he wrote and revised his famous novel, <i>The Picture of
Dorian Gray</i> (1891). Among the more striking changes to the manuscript
(<i>MS</i>) is the suppression of homoeroticism between the three main
characters: the painter Basil Hallward, his subject Dorian Gray, and
their friend, Lord Henry Wotton.

This project examines in detail Wilde's revisions to the <i>MS</i>'s
homoerotic elements by using a digital tool that allows researchers to
mark and describe each revision. I follow the electronic editing
standard called the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to encode or "mark
up" the deletions, additions, and alterations that Wilde makes to
obscure the /MS/’s homoerotic content. Text encoding with TEI (as
explained further below) allows researchers to isolate and describe in
detail various features of textual data. In analyzing these changes, I
draw from debates in the fields of Textual Scholarship and Queer
Historiography, which inform my approach for handling homoerotic
subject matter within digital contexts. I draw out a parallel debate
from within these fields about what to do with what Electronic Editing
scholar Jerome McGann calls our “textual inheritance.”<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The
parallel debate across these fields allows me to carve out a
methodology for working with TEI to analyze queer literary material.

This project endeavours to answer a question that plagues the emerging
field of Queer Digital Humanities, or "Queer DH." As TEI and Literary
Scholar Julia Flanders asks--<i>do we need to queer markup or is markup
already queerable?</i> By "already queerable," Flanders refers to TEI's
inherent "extensibility," which allows researchers to create custom
TEI tags that suit the particular needs of their projects. The
potential for customization, according to Flanders, allows researchers
to "imagine descriptive systems for identity that would operate in
specific contexts (rather than totalizing contexts)&#x2026; with
appropriate places for saying 'there is also something incontestable
here.'"<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Flanders question interrogates markup's place between two current
approaches in Queer DH: first, the approach that wants to disrupt
formal systems by imagining alternative ones; and second, the approach
in which queerness is built into computing, is inherent in
computational logic. The first approach tends to center around
speculative or critical making projects that problematize the
constructed nature of technical objects. For example, Zach Blas and
micha cárdenas's <i>transCoder</i>, a "queer programming anti-language,"
features programming functions inspired by Judith Butler like the
"destabilizationLoop()" that "breaks apart any process that acts as a
continuously iterating power." Another project that probes the
possibilities of queering digital tools is "Queer OS: A User’s
Manual," which is a set of guidelines that describe how various
components of an operating system, such as interfaces, applications,
and memory might function unexpectedly within an ethos of
queerness.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> As literary scholars Pamela Caughie and Sabine Meyer
point out, "Data will always be contextual, limited, and only
proximate to any individual identity," and therefore runs against the
fundamental elusiveness of the complex gender ontologies.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> The
other side of the debate explores how current technological systems
and tools already contain elements of queerness and encourage queer
modes of analysis. For example, work by Jacob Gaboury explores how the
NULL value in computation signals a "refusal to cohere, to become
legible" as a built-in option in computational systems. Gaboury
explains how the NULL value "corresponds with the epistemological
condition of queerness as an excessive illegibility collapsed into an
unwieldy frame, an aberrant third-ness within an otherwise normative
system of relations."<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> And literary scholars like Marion Thain
have found in TEI's strict tagging structure the potential for marking
the complex multiplicity of queer identity.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>

<p>
In attempt to cut between these debates, this paper identifies one
major constraint in using TEI within a "queer encoding"
practice. TEI's constraint is that it works best with data that is
discrete, rather than smooth or ambiguous data, like the homoeroticism
in this text. To engage the rigid structure of the TEI against the
text's homoerotic elements, I extend the TEI, offering my own
customization that marks Wilde's alterations and deletions according
to homoerotic themes which include “intimacy,” “beauty,” “passion” and
“fatality.” I find that the fixed nature of the TEI as a naming and
bounding tool allows me to trouble the boundaries of queerness in this
text. This experiment in "queer encoding" bases the challenge of
marking homoerotic elements as a foundation for theorizing queer
engagements with computational methods. The payoff of working with
markiup is that it brings researchers to reconsider their roles in
these acts of labelling: to probe the the impulses and tensions
between fixity and fluidity.

</p>

<p>
The debates over editorial approaches in the field of Textual
Scholarship offer an interesting parallel to those in Queer
Historiography on the question of what to do with materials from the
past. To answer this question, Textual Scholarship and Queer
Historiography offer what I call "productive" and "restorative"
approaches toward their subject matter. In Textual Scholarship, these
approaches contrast across editorial practices that increasingly
delimit the purpose and purview of the editor as a recoverer or
preserver of texts, and those practices that permit the authority of
the editor as an enabler of textual readings. The history of Textual
Criticism first tends toward the restorative approach, which is about
"correcting" or aligning text with a prior witness. Then, spurred by
the advent of digital technology and the popularization of digital
tools, editing more about finding ways to multiply the text's
potential forms and readings.

</p>

<p>
The "restorative approach" begins with the work of Ronald B. McKerrow,
a leading twentieth-century Shakespearean scholar, who maintains that
the goal of scholarly editing is to preserve authorial
intention.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> McKerrow's influential model for "copy-text" editing, which
establishes the base-text for editing on an early witness that most
closely resembles the author's original intention, eventually gives
way to Walter W. Greg's approach that expands critics' purview to more
than a single witness.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> Fredson Bowers and Thomas Tanselle advance
Greg's work, emphasizing the influence of authorial intention and
favoring the "eclectic edition," which depends heavily on the editor's
judgment to determine authorial intention from multiple
sources.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> Tanselle in particular places a high value in the editor who
is the only one able to recognize and handle inevitable textual
corruption. Guiding Tanselle's position is his claim that a text is
vessel for the ideal "work" that can only be realized by the editor:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of
it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in
sound waves&#x2026; its medium is neither visual nor auditory. The medium
of literature is the words (whether already existent or newly created)
of a language; and arrangements of words according to the syntax of
some language (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses
or punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are
reported by voice or in writing.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tanselle explains that act of inscription involves physical tools that
ultimately corrupt the pure ideas "in the mind" of the writer. Thus,
the writer requires an editor who remains sufficiently distant from
the creation and transcription of the text to objectively intimate its
true intention.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of the 20th century, D.F. McKenzie claims that no
single text, regardless of scrupulous editing by the critic, can
represent an "ideal" version. McKenzie examines how text, which
includes sound and electronic media, takes on new forms and meanings
in in their reprinting and reproduction, what he calls the "sociology"
of texts. According to McKenzie, the book is never a single object,
but a product of a number of human agencies and mechanical techniques
that are historically situated: "Every society rewrites its past,
every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have any continuing life
at all, at some point every printer redesigns them."<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup> Building
on McKenzie's ideas, Jerome McGann explores how this sociological
perspective might be expanded into digital editing environments, where
electronic formats create opportunities for presenting textual
variation. McGann explains that textual criticism in print format is
limited because it must conform to its object of study&#x2014;to the linear
and two dimensional form of the codex. By contrast, digital editions
can be designed for complex, reflexive, and ongoing interactions
between reader and text. McGann notes that his work on the digital
<i>Rossetti Archive</i> brought him to repeatedly reconsider his earlier
conception and goals, explaining that the archive "seemed more and
more an instrument for imagining what we didn’t know."<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup> McGann's
approach replaces Tanselle's fidelity toward authorial intention with
a drive to harness the potentiality of textual variation. The
transformation of literary material into electronic format becomes a
vehicle for a critical analytical method that McGann and Lisa Samuels
call "deformative criticism." Deformative criticism works by
distorting, disordering, or re-assembling literary material,
continually subscribing the text to new configurations, in order to
estrange the reader from her familiarity of the text. This
estrangement forces the reader to encounter the text in a new way and
discover new insights about its formal significance and meaning.

<p>
There are two competing approaches to Queer Historiography that
parallels the "restorative" and "productive" approaches that I've
highlighted in Textual Scholarship. In Queer Historiography, critics
debate the extent to which they in the present might adequately know
queerness in the past. On the "restorative" side, there is the "Queer
Historicist" position, advocated by scholars like David Halperin and
Valerie Traub, who maintain that homosexuality is historically
constructed, that it means something different today than it does in
the past, and that we can get at what it means by tracing the
discussions about sex and sexuality over time.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup> On the
"productive" side are the "unhistoricists," including Jonathan
Goldberg, Madhavi Menon, and Carla Freccero, who are wary of
historiographical methods that demarcate queer subjectivity across
history in ways that imply progress.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> They maintain that although
one can not fully know what "queer" is or has meant, one may pursue a
method of <i>homohistory</i>, "with all its connotations of sameness,
similarity, proximity, and anachronism" (Goldberg, Menon
1609). Goldberg and Menon caution that historiographical methods that
attempt to pin down "queer" throughout history have the effect of
normalizing queerness: "to produce queerness as an object of our
scrutiny would mean the end of queering itself, a capitulation to
teleology" (1608).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-3-0-2">
<p>
Heather Love refocuses this debate to examine the relationship between
the critic and the object of study. Love explains that for the queer
critic, "Queer history has been an education in absence: the
experience of social refusal and of the denigration of homosexual love
has taught us the lessons of solitude and heartbreak" (52). Her
methodology takes negative affects like shame, anger, disgust, hatred,
disappointment as phenomena that cannot be resolved, recuperated, or
rescued by the queer historian regardless of how hard she
tries. Rather than attempt fix the past, Love offers the methodology
of "feeling backward," an accounting of "the social, psychic, and
corporeal effects of homophobia" (2). In "feeling backward," Love is
interested in exploring the way that subjects turn away or refuse the
critic's attempt to "redeem" or "rescue" them: "I want to suggest a
mode of historiography that recognizes the inevitability of a 'play of
recognitions' but that also sees these recognitions not as consoling
but as shattering" (45). She gives the example of the myth of Orpheus
and Eurydice, pointing out that Orpheus <i>prefers</i> to behold Eurydice
in the darkness of the Underworld rather than in the
sunlight <sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup>. Love explains that this is a crucial lesson for queer
critics::
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[Eurydice's] specific attraction for queer subjects is an effect, I
want to argue, of a historical experience of love as bound up with
loss. To recognize Eurydice as desirable in her turn away is a way of
identifying through that loss. Such an approach would be consistent
with an important aspect of contemporary queer politics, which has
tended to define community not as constituted by a shared set of
traits, but rather as emerging from a shared experience of social
violence. 51
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although Orpheus intends to rescue her, bringing Eurydice into the
light of day would transform her into something else, something less
desirable.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-3-0-3">
<p>
Like Textual Scholarship, the field of Queer Historiography is plagued
by the problem of what to do with the materials from the
past. Although the impulse that Love describes of the queer theorist
to "rescue" queer figures from the past evokes Tanselle's aim to
"recover" the ideal text in scholarly editing, Love knows this rescue
is impossible. She explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Such is the relation of the queer historian to the past: we cannot
help wanting to save the figures from the past, but this mission is
doomed to fail. In part, this is because the dead are gone for good;
in part, because the queer past is even more remote, more deeply
marked by power's claw&#x2026; Such a rescue effort can only take place
under the shadow of loss and in the name of loss; success would
constitute failure. 51
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Taking this impossibility as inspiration, one might rethink what to do
with, or how to access or preserve, the queer textual
inheritance. Love suggests how to begin&#x2013;by paying attention to
negative and elusive affects without trying to convert or transform
them to something more intelligible or palatable. Accepting queerness
as that which eludes containment, however, may also encourage the
critic to plumb the ways that queerness continues to escape critical
analysis. One may, borrowing from McGann, explore the ways that
technological tools offer opportunities for analyzing text by impose
new formal structure and configurations on that text. TEI, as a markup
language, is one such tool that allows me to experiment with the
potential of marking and delimiting queerness.

<p>
Using the TEI allows me to explore an alterative to debates about
Wilde's intensions with revising the story's homoerotic
elements. Textual scholars like Donald Lawler, Joseph Bristow, and
Nicolas Ruddick claim that Wilde's changes to the manuscript fit
within a larger project of aestheticization Wilde undertook as he
composed and revised the novel. The events behind the creation of
<i>Dorian Gray</i> begin in the summer of 1889, when the story is first
solicited from Wilde by the editor of <i>Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine</i>,
and ends in the spring of 1891, when it is finally published in book
format by Ward, Lock, and Company. In August 1889, Wilde agrees to
write a story for John Marshall Stoddart, an American publisher from
J.B. Lippincott Company in Philadelphia. Presumably, Wilde works on
the manuscript until April or May of 1890, when it is typed and
revised before being mailed to Stoddart’s offices in Philadelphia. The
surviving manuscript and typescript indicate that Wilde revises his
work multiple times, and that Stoddart excises some 500 words from the
typescript before it is published in <i>Lippincott's</i> on June 20,
1890.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup> This first printing of "The Picture of Dorian Gray," which
spans 98 pages over 13 chapters, was widely criticized for its
seemingly ambiguous stance on an immoral protagonist. Joseph Bristow,
the editor of <i>The Variorum Edition of</i> Dorian Gray, explains that
"[Wilde’s] narrative struck the [reviewers] as a work that appeared
'corrupt', displayed 'effeminate frivolity', and dealt 'with matters
only fitted for the Criminal Investigation Department/.'"<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup> Wilde
would spend the next several days defending his work in letters to the
editors, entering into a public correspondence with them.<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
A few months later, in the early spring of 1891, Wilde publishes a
"Preface" to "The Picture of Dorian Gray" in <i>The Fortnightly
Review</i>. The "Preface," according to scholar Barbara Leckie, "advances
an art-for-art’s sake position that attempts to remove the novel from
the debate by severing the connection between art and society
and&#x2026; denying the moral force of literature.”<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup> In a list of
concise aphorisms, the "Preface" makes claims such as, "Those who find
ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being
charming. This is a fault" and "To reveal art and conceal the artist
is art’s aim."<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup> By these complex and incisive statements, Leckie
asserts that "Wilde's strategy is to refocus on art and disparage the
focus on the reader by saying that the reader is the one who makes a
work immoral."<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21">21</a></sup> Similarly, textual scholar Donald Lawler argues
that "the 'Preface' relates to the novel only obliquely by subverting
the standards of Philistine art criticism and holding up aesthetic
beauty and artistic effect as the only legitimate criteria of critical
evaluation."<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22">22</a></sup> Though Wilde may have seen the "Preface" as an
opportunity to indict those readers and critics who impose a moral
judgement on Dorian, the message is perhaps buried in paradox and
contradictions. The effect may be to confuse and distract some readers
from realizing that they are the objects of Wilde’s critique. Nicolas
Ruddick points out that "the obvious contradiction between the
retained episode of the poisonous yellow book and the prefatory
aphorism beginning 'There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book'
would be offered as one of the delicious paradoxes that might bother
only the small-minded."<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23">23</a></sup> Wilde subsequently works on revising
the <i>Lippincott’s</i> version of the story for publication by Ward, Lock
&amp; Company in April 1891. This new edition contains 20 chapters
including the "Preface." Here, Wilde continues to delete and alter
passages that express moments of intimacy and romantic passion between
the characters. According to the editor of the <i>Uncensored Edition</i> of
<i>Dorian Gray</i>, Victor Frankel, significant deletions include passages
with explicit homosexual references, promiscuous or illicit
heterosexuality, and "anything that smacked generally of
decadence."<sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24">24</a></sup> Wilde also revises the ending of the novel in order
to "heighten Dorian’s monstrosity toward the novel’s conclusion,
making clearer the suggestion that Dorian’s destruction of the
portrait was only an attempt to destroy 'the evidence' against
him."<sup><a id="fnr.25" class="footref" href="#fn.25">25</a></sup> In doing this, Frankel argues, Wilde aimed to bring "the
novel to a moral conclusion that he thought would silence his
critics."<sup><a id="fnr.26" class="footref" href="#fn.26">26</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The textual scholarship on <i>Dorian Gray</i> generally agrees that Wilde
supresses the moral of the story by aestheticizing the text. The
moral, according to Wilde himself in one of his letters to the <i>St
James Gazette</i>, is that "all excess, as well as all renunciation,
brings its own punishment."<sup><a id="fnr.27" class="footref" href="#fn.27">27</a></sup> Bristow argues that Wilde obscures
the moral from the story’s early stages, when he was preparing it for
publication in <i>Lippincott’s</i>: “In keeping with the manuscript, in the
typescript Wilde proved reluctant&#x2026; to preserve any statements that
might lend unnecessary emphasis to what might be viewed as the
implicit moral of the tale.’”<sup><a id="fnr.28" class="footref" href="#fn.28">28</a></sup>. In addition to emphasizing
Dorian's immorality, Lawler adds another purpose to Wilde's
revisions&#x2014;the quality of the writing. According to Lawler, “By
Wilde’s shifting his emphasis in the <i>Lippincott’s</i> and in the Ward,
Lock &amp; Company <i>Dorian Gray</i> from homosexual passion to aesthetic
interest, Basil’s culpability is Dorian’s fall from grace is muffled
and reduced finally to that of the author of the detested
painting.”<sup><a id="fnr.29" class="footref" href="#fn.29">29</a></sup> He also adds that “in most cases the offensive
passages shown above in the notes were cut because of their mawkish
and sentimental writing as much for their affront to contemporary
moral standards.”<sup><a id="fnr.30" class="footref" href="#fn.30">30</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Upending these claims about morality and style, Ruddick offers another
perspective on Wilde’s treatment of the homosexual content. Examining
the differences between the <i>DG90</i> and <i>DG91</i>, Ruddick argues that
<i>DG90</i> is the “aesthetically superior” text, because it does a better
job than <i>DG91</i> maintaining a coherence between the story’s two
morals. The two parables concern the dangers of vanity and the
liberalization of homosexuality: while the overt parable “dramatize[s]
the disastrous consequences of the preference of the beautiful at the
expense of the good”, the covert parable, by contrast, “explores the
destructive effects of the clandestine or closeted life.”<sup><a id="fnr.31" class="footref" href="#fn.31">31</a></sup>
According to Ruddick, while <i>DG90</i> creates a disjunction between what
he calls the “overt” and “covert” parables, of the story, the
revisions in <i>DG91</i> fail to resolve this flaw. Ruddick contends that
Wilde, in <i>DG91</i>, “chose the route of suppression,” reducing the
homoerotic elements and including a preface defending art from the
moral judgements of the bourgeois critic. <sup><a id="fnr.32" class="footref" href="#fn.32">32</a></sup> Ruddick explains
that the two parables appear to associate vanity and closeted
homosexuality with corruption: “the appalling changes to Dorian’s
painted image in <i>DG90</i> strongly suggest that the unspeakable
practices indulged in by the protagonist are unspeakable in
themselves.”<sup><a id="fnr.33" class="footref" href="#fn.33">33</a></sup> So, according to Ruddick, Wilde’s later story
emphasizes a moral that warns against the dangers of vanity at the
expense of one about the liberalization of homosexuality.
</p>

<p>
The question over Wilde's purpose and intention in revising plays up
against the ways that we might work productively with the revisions,
to create something that informs its queerness. My work with the TEI
allows me to explore precisely how marking up queerness engages with
such debates.

TEI (short for Text Encoding Initiative), is an
electronic editing standard for transcribing and editing textual
elements so that computers can "read" them. In more technical terms,
TEI is a "markup language," that enables users to "mark up" aspects of
literary texts that they think are important, like structural elements
(chapters, paragraphs, line breaks), physical details about the text
(revisions, illegible text) or conceptual elements (like persons or
places). All texts are implicitly encoded (or marked up) in the sense
of punctuation, capitalization, disposition of letters around the
page, even the spaces between words. Created specifically for working
with literary material, TEI offers a set of guidelines for
transcribing and editing print text or manuscripts into electronic
format. Maintained by the TEI Consortium, the guidelines contains
rules for using various "tags" to mark up certain textual elements,
such as <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> to indicate a line of text, <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>, to indicate
deleted text, and <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>, for a reference to a person. Below is an
image of TEI text, in this case the manuscript from Mary Shelley's
<i>Frankenstein</i>, digitized and encoded by the Shelley-Godwin Archive
(see Fig. 4).

The above excerpt also includes a <code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> tag and <code>@hand</code>
attribute, which indicate whose "hand" is reponsible for each section
of text. This is valuable information for a text that was composed by
Mary Shelley, and co-edited by her husband, Percy Shelley. For
example, in line 8 of the above TEI excerpt, one can see that Percy
Shelley makes an addition within the <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> tag.

<p>
As in the above example, TEI documents resemble an ordered hierarchy
or nested tree structure, with the one "root" component and several
"branches" that divide into smaller components, which David
J. Birnbaum describes as "nodes." This hierarchical nature of the TEI
means that all elements in the text must be contained within this
bounded structure, where one cannot overlap elements, but only nest
them. Note in the below example, where the <code>&lt;emphasis&gt;</code> tags are
contained within the <code>&lt;sentence&gt;</code> tags:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
&lt;sentence&gt;This is &lt;emphasis&gt;bad&lt;/sentence&gt;form.&lt;/emphasis&gt; 
&lt;sentence&gt;This is &lt;emphasis&gt;good&lt;/emphasis&gt;form.&lt;/sentence&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Though the strict tagging structure of TEI forces encoders to
categorize or label textual elements in a way that contains
overlapping data, it also encourages them to address more fixed and
disambiguated textual elements. Perhaps the most useful aspect about
TEI is its customizability. As an extension of XML, or eXtensible
Markup Language, specifically made to render humanities textual data,
TEI is can be "extended" or customized to suit the needs of each
encoding project. Users may create their own tags to describe the
particular elements they wish to encode. <i>The Women Writers Project</i>,
directed by Julia Flanders, adequately frames how TEI's inherent
extensibility can address textual ambiguity. According to the <i>WWP</i>:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
Unlike many standardization efforts, the TEI &#x2026; explicitly
accommodat[es] variation and debate within its technical
framework. The TEI Guidelines are designed to be both modular and
customizable, so that specific projects can choose the relevant
portions of the TEI and ignore the rest, and can also if necessary
create extensions of the TEI language to describe facets of the text
which the TEI does not yet address.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Because TEI is built from a language that allows its users to build
their own version of that language, there is potential for
representing the elements necessary to a project by customizing these
elements on a project-by-project basis.

<p>
In order to be standardizable and sustainable across a variety of
contexts, TEI imposes a certain fixity on textual data. However, the
enforcement of standards for encoding text has its drawbacks, in
particular to encoding queer elements. As queer studies scholars (and
humanists in general) well know, textual data is open to
interpretation, and there are always elements that cannot be contained
within rigid categories or delimitations. There are a number of
projects that explore the potential of TEI for what Julia Flanders
calls "queer encoding." The encoding of queer gender, for example, is
one interesting case study. Julia Flanders explains that the
<code>&lt;person&gt;</code> tag, which describes persons referenced within a text, is
limited to one gender identity for each person. For scholars working
to encode multiple or diverse sexual identities, this data structure
creates obstacles. For example, Pamela Caughie and Sabine Meyer
attempt to encode gender identity in <i>Man Into Woman</i>, the life
narrative of Lili Elbe, also known as the Danish artist Einer Wagner
who undertook one of the first gender affirming surgeries in 1930. The
attempt to mark up Elbe's complex gender ontology brought Caughie and
Meyer against this structural limitation of the TEI, that the "sex"
attribute cannot accomodate the plural sexualities and sexual
identities:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[T]he deeper we got into mark-up, the more evident it became that the
categories and hierarchies available to us were inadequate for our
task&#x2026; to identify a male subject who at times presents himself as
masquerading as a woman, at others as being inhabited by one, and who
eventually becomes a woman, in a life history narrated retrospectively
from the perspective of Lili Elbe. 231
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interestingly, the limitations of the TEI forced these scholars to
consider the ways that computation works on a deeper level to reify
gender as essential. In this project, the fixity that the TEI imposes
upon the Elbe as a queer subject brought out the ways that gender is
situational and relational across this text.
</p>

<p>
Other scholars have found advantage in TEI's data structure. While TEI
is strict about what constitutes a person&#x2013;as an entity with one sex,
for example&#x2013;it also enables an approach toward personhood as
multiple. Like Caughie and Meyer, Marion Thain also works with a
complex writing subject, the late-19th-century English poet, Michael
Field. Thain works to encode the diaries of Michael Field, which is a
pen name for the lesbian couple, Katharine Bradley and Edith
Cooper. According to Thain, Michael Field signifies "the assumed names
of two separate women, as well as appearing to signify one single male
identity."<sup><a id="fnr.34" class="footref" href="#fn.34">34</a></sup> The TEI enables the encoding of multiple identities,
which is central for understanding the queerness of the diaries:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[T]he proliferation and slipperiness of names is no mere childish
caprice but a core part of the articulation of queer: an unhinging of
'given' or apparently predetermined identity through a strategy that
articulates identity as constantly shifting, constructed, and
performative. Text encoding can, in a simple but powerful way, help us
explore and map this crucial strand of queer identity construction
across the diary.<sup><a id="fnr.35" class="footref" href="#fn.35">35</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thain's approach harnesses the hierarchical nature of the TEI to list
the various references to each personage within the <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>
tag. This <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> tag allows Thain to "render searchable words
not in the text but intimately tied to it. This is not a small issue
in a diary in which Katharine Bradley herself is referred to by more
than 20 different names."<sup><a id="fnr.36" class="footref" href="#fn.36">36</a></sup> By encoding each identity to its
proper personage, TEI enables Thain to solve the manage the of
multiple identities in this text.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-4-0-5">
<p>
Why do Caughie and Meyer struggle to encode Elbe's identity while
Thain appears to succeed with Field? The answer is that Elbe's
identity is <i>plural</i>, while Field's is <i>multiple</i>, and the TEI works
best when data, like Fields's, is discrete. As Flanders points out,
markup, as a tool for naming, bounding, and containment, works best
with information that can be separated into distinct components,
rather than smooth information with vague boundaries.<sup><a id="fnr.37" class="footref" href="#fn.37">37</a></sup> In other
words, as long as identities are distinct and contained within
specific entities, TEI can encode them. Thain explains that Michael
Field's identity "do[es] not pretend to record the life of a single
male, as two different hands record the experience of two clearly
differentiated people."<sup><a id="fnr.38" class="footref" href="#fn.38">38</a></sup> Elbe's identity, by contrast, is not
multiple as much as it is plural, containing several identities whose
relationship to each other is ambiguous or continually shifting within
one entity. Elbe's relation to gender is smooth, best described
qualitatively, as one that alternatively "masquerades" or "inhabits"
simultaneous gender ontologies. While a queerness like Fields's might
be delineated and contained, in Elbe's there is a quality of blending
which the markup, by its nature, means to separate and fix.

<p>
For Wilde's text in particular, the rigid structure of the TEI tags
offer an opportunity for exploring the potential of bounding and
labelling as an exercise in "queer encoding." I have created a
customization to experiment with semantic labelling against the
demands for fixity and structure within the TEI schema. My
customization registers physical and conceptual changes to the
manuscript by creating two new attributes to mark the revisions. Fist,
to mark the physical traces of Wilde's pen as he struck out portions
of the text, I created the new attribute, "strokes" (<code>@strokes</code> in
formal TEI notation), and set its value to a number. Most often, Wilde
uses one or two strokes of his pen, although sometimes, the strokes
are too heavy or thick to enumerate. For example, in the below image
(Fig. 6), where Wilde revises the phrase "look of pain" to "expression
of perplexity," Wilde's pen nearly blots out the word "look," while
the word "pain" only has one stroke. In this case, I set the
<code>@strokes</code> attribute to the value, "inconclusive."
</p>

<p>
<img src="./fig_5.png" alt="fig_5.png" />
Figure 5: Close-up image of detail on MS 9 from The Morgan Library and
Museum. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to <code>@strokes</code>, I also created the new attribute,
<code>@implication</code>, and set its value to a number of recurring themes from
the deleted text. The themes include: "intimacy," "beauty," "passion,"
and "fatality," with the additional values of "inconclusive" or
"illegible" to describe ambiguous elements.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, I detail my encoding work on the <i>MS</i>. This
customization allows me to mark the ways that homoeroticism has been
elided or transformed as Wilde prepared the text for publication. That
being said, solidifying a formal method for marking queer elements is
not the goal of this particular project. Rather, my goal is to use TEI
to probe the limitation of such a formal method. Love points out that
any attempt to affix queerness in the past "can only take place under
the shadow of loss&#x2026; success would constitute failure" (Love, 2009,
p. 51). My work in using the attributes surfaces a formal quality of
indeterminacy&#x2013;the "data structure" for the homoerotic elements is
fuzzy or blurred, with boundaries that resist demarcation. Wilde's
revisions constitute a spectrum of smooth information, rather than
discrete. Here, the difficulty was in engaging the boundedness of the
TEI elements, which must encapsulate data, with the indistinctiveness
of the queerness of the text. To add another layer of complexity, the
strokes also engage with the content of the revisions. Several
instances of smooth information, to be captured within a fixed data
structure. In order to mark up this text, I have to make imposing
decisions on the data.

<p>
The evocative opening scene, which consists of a lively dialogue
between Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton, sets the tone, reveals
character dynamics, and lays out the conflict for the ensuing
story. In these first few pages, Basil comes across as a sympathetic,
sensitive, albeit slightly exasperated artist, who confides to his
close friend the powerful influence that Dorian Gray has had upon his
life and work. Lord Henry, by contrast, appears as an affable and
witty gentleman aesthete, who counters Basil’s confessional utterances
with offbeat and pardoxical observations. 
</p>

<p>
A few patterns emerge from the revisions across these pages, which
coalesce into a list of themes: intimacy, beauty, passion, and
fatality. 
</p>

<p>
First, the revisions work to stifle the emotional tension and physical
affection in the dialogue between Basil and Lord Henry, replacing it
with a lighter or more neutral tone. Because these revisions generally
work to shore up the friendship between Basil and Lord Henry,
conveying the fondness in their rapport, they are encoded according to
the theme of "intimacy." 
</p>

<p>
Second is the theme of beauty, which mostly concerns revisions where
Dorian is reformulated from a romantic object into an artistic subject
for Basil's painting. 
</p>

<p>
Third is the theme of passion, which is &#x2026;.. 
</p>

<p>
Fourth, and finally, the theme of fatality, which heavily focus on
moments when Basil struggles or hesistates to explain Dorian's
influence on his life. Basil conveys a devotion to Dorian which is
melodramatic and borders on self-destructive.
</p>

<p>
But as will be clear, demarcating the individual themes is challenging
work. There are blurrings between the themes: 
</p>

<p>
intimacy &#x2013;&gt; fatality: when such moments get too emotionally intense.
beauty &#x2013;&gt; passion: when descriptions of beauty are infused with an erotic charge.
passion &#x2013;&gt; fatality:

</li>

<li><a id="org2a7df51"></a><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> engaging intimacy and fatality<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-5-0-6">
<p>
I will begin with the revisions that suppress suggestions of intimacy
between Basil and Lord Henry. In the manuscript, Wilde’s pen slashes
through evidence of physical contact, such as on page nine, which
describes Basil “taking hold of [Lord Henry’s] hand.” 
</p>

<p>
However, the sense of intimacy between Basil and Lord Henry is
inextricable with a hint of fatality. In diminishing the sense of
intimacy between the two friends, Wilde also mitigates a foreboding in
their conversation, replacing tense pauses with laughter or exchanging
dramatic statements and descriptions with more playful ones. Two
particularly striking moments depict Basil’s struggle to convey why he
cannot exhibit Dorian’s portrait. In the first, Lord Henry encourages
Basil to explain his hesitation. Prior to any revisions, the dialogue
in the manuscript reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry hesitated for a moment. ‘And what is that?’ he asked, in a
low voice. ‘I will tell you,’ said Hallward, and a look of pain came
over his face. ‘Don’t if you would rather not,’ murmured his
companion, looking at him” (MS 9). 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The revised version in the manuscript, incorporating the deletions and
interlinear additions, reads: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry laughed. ‘And what is that?’  he asked. ‘I will tell you,’
said Hallward, and an expression of perplexity came over his face. ‘I
am all expectation Basil,’ murmured his companion, looking at him” (MS
9).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, several changes mitigate the emotions of the scene. First,
rather than hesitate, Lord Henry laughs, and he no longer speaks “in a
low voice": the effect is to overwrite a previously intimate moment
with levity. Basil also exchanges his emotional misery for mental
confusion when “a look of pain” becomes “an expression of
perplexity”. And lastly, Lord Henry, rather than sympathizing with his
friend’s difficulty and releasing him from the obligation to explain
himself, instead encourages him to speak, “I am all expectation,
Basil”. Together, these changes work to lighten the mood of the scene
and obscure Basil’s internal suffering.

In using the TEI to encode this passage, I struggled to disambiguate
the theme of revision. Below is an image of the manuscript page

</p>

<p>
Does the phrase "look of pain" express a sense of passion or fatality?
On the one hand, "pain" is a strong feeling, or passion, associated
with desire. On the other hand, Basil often draws on pain in his
references to the fatality of his attraction to Dorian, as in the
following quote, which was deleted: "I feel, Harry, that I have given
away my whole soul to someone seems to take a real delight in giving
me pain" (MS 23). Adding another layer of complexity to this example,
Wilde uses different kinds of strokes for the same phrase. With TEI,
it is impossible to mark the variations in strokes without separating
the single revision into two instances. Therefore, in marking the
strokes, I opted to use the value "inconclusive."
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org43fc562"></a><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> revise theme of jealousy into fatality? something else?<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-5-0-8">
<p>
As part of allaying the intimacy in the dialogue between Basil and
Lord Henry, Wilde removes suggestions of jealousy between them. At the
end of the first chapter, Basil implores Lord Henry in vague terms to
abstain with regard to Dorian. The original version reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life lovely for
me. Mind, Harry, I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly, and the words
seemed wrung out of him, almost against his will.
</p>

<p>
‘I don’t suppose I shall care for him, and I am quite sure he won’t
care for me,’ replied Lord Henry smiling, and he took Hallward by the
arm, and almost led him into the house. (MS 27, 27B, 28)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this dialogue, the subtextual meaning of Basil’s request—-“Don’t
take [Dorian] away from me”—-reveals itself in Lord Henry’s assurance
that neither he nor Dorian shall “care for” each other. This response
characterizes Basil’s possessiveness over Dorian as a jealous
one. However, the source of Basil’s anxiety changes with the next
revision, where Wilde gives him more lines of explanation and
accordingly alters Lord Henry’s response. The revision thus proceeds:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life absolutely
lovely to me, and that gives my art whatever wonder or charm it
possesses. Mind. Harry, I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly, and the
words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.
</p>

<p>
‘What nonsense you talk,’ said Lord Henry smiling, and, taking
Hallward by the arm, he almost led him to the house. (MS 27, 27B)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this revision, Basil attributes an aesthetic value to Dorian,
asserting Dorian’s importance for his art, giving it “whatever wonder
or charm it possesses.” And Lord Henry’s response moves from
reassurance to dismissal, rejecting Basil’s anxiety as “nonsense”, and
ending the scene on a slightly humorous note. By portraying Dorian as
an artistic subject and asserting Basil’s anxiety about losing that
subject, Wilde evacuates the jealous tension between the two men. And
by transforming Lord Henry’s emotional tone from reassurance to
light-hearted repartee, the interaction loses its intimacy. The effect
is to replace the subtle jealousy and  mutual understanding between
Basil and Lord Henry with a friendly banter.
</p>

<li><a id="org1af6104"></a><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> move to intimacy/fatality<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-5-0-9">
<p>
The next theme, tension, is related to intimacy. It similarly tempers
an intense emotional energy, while also mitigating a sense of anxiety
or foreboding. One example occurs on the next page, when Basil is on
the verge of revealing the reasons behind his attraction for
Dorian. The original dialogue proceeds:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,
and he heard his own breath, with a sense almost of fear. ‘Yes. There
is very little to tell you,’ whispered Hallward, ‘and I am afraid you
will be disappointed. Two months ago&#x2026;’” (MS 10).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The manuscript’s revised version reads: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,
and he wondered what was coming. ‘Yes. There is very little to tell
you,’ whispered Hallward rather bitterly, ‘and I dare say you will be
disappointed. Two months ago&#x2026;’” (MS 10).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, rather than draw attention to Lord Henry’s breathing, Wilde
mentions Lord Henry’s “wonder” about Basil’s pending explanation,
shifting Lord Henry’s sense of anticipation from fear to curiosity. He
also makes slight changes to Basil’s delivery: in the revised version,
Basil speaks “rather bitterly” and uses the expression “I dare say”
rather than “I am afraid”. Both changes diminish the confessional tone
that originally precedes Basil’s revelation about Dorian Gray.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgdddbd48"></a><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> assert that 'beauty' becomes more precise, not less<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-5-0-10">
<p>
Often throughout this chapter, Wilde cuts through individual words and
replaces them with ones that are less precise and suggestive,
distracting from the original connotation. He focuses this type of
revision on Basil’s dialogue, particularly when Basil speaks about his
passionate attachment to Dorian, and the effect of Dorian's beauty
upon his art. Here, Wilde will trade expressive nouns with words that
convey relatively weaker or less specific descriptions. For example,
in the sentence “Every portrait that is painted with passion is a
portrait of the artist, not of the sitter”, Basil replaces “passion”
with “feeling” in the manuscript (MS 9), exchanging the romantic
connotation with a more general one.
</p>

<p>
In addition to "passion," Wilde often replaces the word "Beauty" in
Basil's references to Dorian. Wilde revises: “Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose <i>beauty</i> had so stirred me” to
“Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose
<i>personality</i> had so strangely stirred me” (MS 13, my emphasis). The
replacement of “beauty” with “personality” allows Basil to completely
avoid mentioning Dorian’s physical appearance, and the addition of
“strangely” serves to mystify Dorian’s influence over
Basil. Throughout the chapter, Wilde makes several more revisions of
the word “beauty” that relate directly to Dorian: on page six, he
replaces “Dorian Gray’s beauty” with “Dorian Gray’s good looks”; and
on page 18, he exchanges “the beauty of Dorian Gray” with “the face of
Dorian Gray”. The decisions here to replace “beauty” with references
to Dorian’s “face” or his “good looks” maintain the emphasis on the
physical while muting the suggestive power of “beauty” in the
abstract. In doing so, it rids the text from the connotations that
generally accompany “Beauty,” including the ideal, the charming, and
the alluring, to instead convey more specific descriptions of visual
attractiveness. By redirecting the attention from suggestive “Beauty”
in the abstract and toward Dorian’s specific attributes, these
revisions evacuate his mysterious allure, diminishing the overwhelming
influence that Dorian holds over Basil.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-5-0-11">
<p>
Another pattern in the revisions works to soften the fatality about
Basil's intense and consuming devotion to Dorian.  First, Wilde takes
out Basil’s references to his troubled state of mind. One example
occurs when Basil recounts his first meeting with Dorian to Lord
Henry. In the original version, Basil admits: “I had a strange feeling
that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I
knew that if I spoke to him, I would never leave him till either he or
I were dead. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room” (MS 12). In
the manuscript, Wilde crosses through “never leave him till either he
or I were dead” and adds, in superscript, “become absolutely devoted
to him, and that I ought not to speak to him.” In removing the
reference to Basil’s death, Wilde eliminates the self-consuming
quality of Basil's devotion. He again revises a reference to Basil’s
death a few pages down, when he professes that “I could not live if I
did not see him every day” (MS 17). On the manuscript, Wilde changes
the line to read, “I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day”
(MS 17). Here, Wilde again avoids admitting the extent to which Dorian
has influenced Basil, tempering the fatality in his attachment to
Dorian.

<p>
&#x2013;&gt; the indistinctness of the themes engages the indistinctness of the strokes
</p>

<p>
Closer to the end of the first chapter, Wilde deletes a rather
strangely written passage (see Fig. 1) describing the masochistic and
jealous qualities of Basil’s attachment. When explaining to Lord Henry
the nature of his devotion, Basil confesses:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to someone
seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. I seem quite adjusted
to it. I can imagine myself doing it. But not to him, not to him. Once
or twice we have been away together, then I have had him all to
myself. I am horribly jealous of him of course. I never let him talk
to me of the people he knows. I like to isolate him from the rest of
life, and to think that he absolutely belongs to me. He does not, I
know. But it gives me pleasure to think that he does, Harry! MS 23
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the manuscript, Wilde crosses out everything after "a real delight
in giving me pain" up to "But it gives me pleasure to think it does,
Harry!" In doing so, he removes suggestions of Basil’s complicity in
his suffering. By withdrawing these lines, Wilde stifles the
destructive connotations of Basil’s fatalistic devotion to Dorian.

My final example concerns a longer passage (see Figs. 2 &amp; 3) that was
heavily revised in the manuscript. The treatment of this passage
crystallizes the various patterns of revision seen so far—-removing
signs of intimacy, diminishing tension in dialogue, references to
Dorian's beauty and Basil's passion and fatality. The passage in the
manuscript bears quoting in full. Prior to any revisions, it reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘You remember that landscape of mine&#x2026; It is one of the best things I
have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it,
Dorian Gray sat beside me, and as he leaned across to look at it, his
cheek just brushed my cheek. The world becomes young to me when I hold
his hand, as when I ask him the [illegible].’
</p>

<p>
‘Basil, this is [illegible] you must not talk [illegible] [illegible]
his power, [indecipherable] to make yourself the [illegible] slave! It
is worse than wicked, it is silly. I hate Dorian Gray.’
</p>

<p>
Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the garden. A
curious smile curled his lips. He seemed like a man in a dream. After
some time he came back. ‘You don’t understand, Harry…’ he
said. ‘Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more
present in my work then when no image of him is there. He is simply a
suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the curves
of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain
colours. That is all.’
</p>

<p>
‘Then why won’t you exhibit his picture?’
</p>

<p>
‘Because I have put into it the romance of which I have never dared to
speak to him. He knows nothing about it, but the world might guess it,
where there is merely love, they would see something evil, where there
is spectacular passion, they would suggest something vile.' <i>MS</i> 20-21
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many of these lines are crossed out, some so heavily, that entire
phrases are illegible, as indicated by the tags. What remains legible,
however, suffices to draw some conclusions about Wilde’s revision
practice. In the first paragraph, the section from “and as he leaned
across” to the end of the paragraph is crossed out in a likely attempt
to remove evidence of physical intimacy (“his cheek just brushed my
cheek”) and suggestions of romance (“the world becomes young to me
when I hold his hand”). While some of this paragraph is legible, the
next one, by contrast, is almost completely blotted out. From what I
can gather, it consists mostly of Lord Henry’s condemnatory and
jealous protestations&#x2013;"his power," "to make yourself the&#x2026; slave!"
and "I hate Dorian Gray." In striking through these lines, Wilde
obscures Lord Henry’s exasperation about Basil succumbing to Dorian’s
charms. Most of the third paragraph eludes erasure, and is preserved
in the manuscript: here, Basil finally explains the precise influence
that Dorian has upon his art&#x2013;as an ideal that inspires and stimulates
beauty in the natural world. Subsequently, in the final paragraph,
Wilde again obscures much of language, particularly this revelatory
line: "where there is merely love, they would see something evil,
where there is spectacular passion, they would suggest something
vile." With this admission, Basil’s meaning throughout the passage
attains clarity: Dorian Gray inspires a powerful, romantic attraction
in Basil that suffuses all of his work with beauty and wonder.

</p>

<p>
More examples occur across the themes of intimacy and affection. In
the below passage (see Fig 8), Wilde revises the phrase "and as he
leaned across to look at it, his cheek just brushed my cheek" to "and
as he leaned across to look at it, his hair just touched my hand" (MS
20). Due to its physical nature, I categorized this particular phrase
as "affection." However, because it is part of a longer passage, I
modified my label to "passion," which is a more general term that
includes other revisions done in the same sentence, such as "The world
becomes young to me when I hold his hand" (MS 20).
</p>

</p>

<p>
To fix these ambiguities, I could tag them with both or even multiple
values. But such tagging would dilute the analytical utility of the
TEI, which is meant to be decisive rather than exhaustive. On the
other hand, I could be even more specific, employing qualitative
markers that are ever more precise, "tenderness" in addition to
"affection," or "ardor" and "devotion," in addition to "passion," for
example.  However, the more specific the tags, the less possibility of
finding connections between them, and the more demarcated the
possibilities for analysis.
</p>

<p>
Together, the changes between the different textual witnesses suggest
that Wilde had a deliberate purpose in revising the first chapter of
the story. It appears that the revisions work to obscure or diminish
the homosexual and homoerotic elements by turning Dorian into an
aesthetic object. They achieve this goal in three ways: first, by
removing the negative connotations of Basil’s attachment to Dorian,
particularly the consuming intensity of his devotion; second, by
easing the tension surrounding his dialogue with Lord Henry, sometimes
lightening the heavier moments with a touch of comedy; and finally, by
emphasizing Dorian as an ideal subject for art, expanding his appeal
from the romantic and the physical toward a spiritual influence that
inflects his surroundings. In these ways, the revisions turn something
troubling and potentially fatal into a celebration of ideal
beauty. This result also accords with Ruddick’s claim, that the
revisions emphasize a moral that warns against the dangers of vanity
at the expense of a moral about the liberalization of
homosexuality. It seems that, by tempering Basil’s passion and
aestheticizing Dorian, Wilde is able to remove the negative
consequences of passion and replace them with the ones of worshipping
beauty. However, while the earliest version of the story appears to
associate homosexuality and vanity with corruption, it also warns
against interpreting passion as a negative quality. Indeed, Basil
makes precisely this argument when he explains to Lord Henry his
reason for not exhibiting the portrait: “where there is merely love,
they would see something evil, where there is spectacular passion,
they would suggest something vile” (MS 21). This line, struck from the
manuscript, leaves one with the suspicion that Wilde may have silenced
the homosexual themes for the same reason that Basil could not exhibit
his portrait.

<h3 id="org4c7e8e2"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> Conclusion: Toward A Queer Form</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
My approach in customizing the TEI is to handle queer elements in a
such way that engages the lessons from queer history. This approach
attends to the slippery themes that elude containment, such as
intimacy and affection, or passion and fatality. Heather Love's
characterization of queerness as "always bound up with loss," enables
textual scholars to accept that queerness is, like Eurydice, already
turning backward (51). That the attempt to "rescue" or "recover"
certain textual elements will only lead to inevitable failure. TEI in
particular encourages the encoder to impose a level of fixity on
text. Therefore, I have tried to tag the homoerotic elements in a way
that enables them to retain some of their elusiveness, without
attempting to pin down or transform their elusiveness into something
more intelligible and palatable.
</p>

<p>
My question, moving forward, is how do we label something as fixed and
at the same time maintain its fluidity? How might we approach tagging
as a way of releasing textual meaning, rather than attempting to
"recover" or "rescue" what is turning backward within the composition
history? Drawing from Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuel's idea of
deformance, we might look at the formalizations produced by this TEI
schema not for what it reveals about Wilde's intentions, but for how
it releases potential readings of the composition history. Such an
approach would redeploy the categorization and labelling of markup
toward speculative experimentation, exploring what Kadji Amin, Amber
Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez describe as “queer form”— “the range of
formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies that make difference a
little less knowable, visible, and digestible.” Keeping a critical
awareness of the TEI limitations, one might use the tool to mark and
visualize queer form, particularly the elusive affects, repressed
desires, and other coded elements of queerness within this text. When
grappling with the strict structure of the TEI, running up against
what can and cannot be encoded, one recognizes what escapes or eludes
our structures for understanding and analyzing queerness to rework
those forms into new configurations.
