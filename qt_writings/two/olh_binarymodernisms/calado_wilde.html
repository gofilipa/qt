                  <p class="grid">Literary and textual scholars have long speculated about Wilde’s intentions
                     for revising the homoerotic content of his famous novel, <i>The Picture of
                        Dorian Gray</i> (1891). More recently, electronic editing standards
                     enable scholars to explore textual composition histories within a digital space.
                     This project uses the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) method, an electronic
                     editing tool that allows researchers to ‘mark up’, or tag, textual
                     elements. Using the TEI, I mark up the first chapter of Wilde’s manuscript
                     of <i>Dorian Gray</i>, which introduces the story’s three main
                     characters, Basil Hallward, Lord Henry Wotten, and Dorian Gray. Drawing from
                     debates in Textual Scholarship and Queer Historiography, I question how
                     electronic editing with the TEI might register or ‘rescue’ the queer
                     affects of this text. My work here pushes against what I identify as TEI’s
                     main constraint, which is its limitation for handling data that is discrete,
                     rather than smooth or ambiguous data, like the homoeroticism of this text. I
                     conclude by proposing a TEI customization that marks Wilde’s revisions
                     according to the four affects of ‘intimacy’, ‘beauty’,
                     ‘passion’ and ‘fatality’. As an experiment in
                     ‘queer encoding’, this customization shows the limits of the strict
                     data structure of the TEI for engaging the fluidity and complexity of queerness
                     in the text.</p>

      <div id="article1-body" class="body">
         <div class="section"><a id="d5e65"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p id="d5e67">In the first scene of the novel, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1891),
               the painter Basil Hallward confesses to his friend Lord Henry Wotton why he cannot
               exhibit the portrait of the eponymous hero. Basil admits, ‘Where there is
               merely love, they would see something evil, where there is spectacular passion, they
               would suggest something vile’ (Wilde, 1889–90: 21). This striking line,
               among many others that carry homoerotic innuendos, never appears in print. It is
               excised during Oscar Wilde’s revision process, along with other suggestions of
               homoeroticism between the three main characters of the story. The textual
               scholarship on this revision process generally agrees that Wilde neutralizes
               Basil’s erotic fascination with Dorian by transforming it into aesthetic
               appreciation. In particular, Nicolas Ruddick argues that Wilde aestheticizes Dorian
               in order to emphasize a moral about the dangers of vanity at the expense of another,
               more covert moral about the liberalization of homosexuality. Ruddick explains that,
               while the moral about vanity ‘dramatize[s] the disastrous consequences of the
               preference of the beautiful at the expense of the good’, the other moral about
               homosexuality ‘explores the destructive effects of the clandestine or closeted
               life’ (<a href="#B22">Ruddick, 2003: 126, 128</a>).
               According to Ruddick, the novel’s famous portrait indexes the convergence of
               the two morals: ‘the appalling changes to Dorian’s painted image …
               strongly suggest that the unspeakable practices indulged in by the protagonist are
               unspeakable in themselves’ (129).</p>
            <p id="d5e75">To interrogate Wilde’s treatment of the homoerotic elements, this paper
               examines his revisions across the first chapter of the manuscript of <i>The
                  Picture of Dorian Gray (1889–90)</i>. I use an electronic editing
               tool called the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI, explained further below) to register
               and describe Wilde’s revisions. My project uses the TEI ‘markup’
               not only to examine the nature of Wilde’s revisions, but also the potential
               for technological tools to engage queerness in textual data. In doing so, it
               endeavors to answer a question that provokes the emerging field of Queer Digital
               Humanities, or Queer DH. As literary and electronic textual scholar Julia Flanders
               asks: ‘do we need to queer markup, or is markup already queerable?’
               (<a href="#B7">2017</a>). Flanders’s question
               considers the TEI’s place between two current approaches in Queer DH: the
               first approach wants to disrupt formal systems by imagining alternative ones, and
               the second, by contrast, maintains that queerness is built into computing and is
               inherent in computational logic. The first approach consists of speculative or
               critical making projects that problematize the constructed nature of technical
               objects. For example, Zach Blas and micha cárdenas propose a speculative
               codebase disrupts the expected functionality of computational programs. This
               project, <i>transCoder</i>, describes hypothetical computer programs such
               as the ‘destabilizationLoop’, which ‘breaks apart any process that
               acts as a continuously iterating power’ and ‘nonteleo()’, which
               ‘strips any program of a goal-oriented result’ (<a href="#B3">Blas and cárdenas: 2007–2012</a>). Another project that
               probes the possibilities of queering digital tools is ‘Queer OS: A
               User’s Manual’, which describes how various components of an operating
               system might function within an ethos of queerness. For example, ‘Queer
               OS’ reconceives how a digital interface ‘might seek out
               self-modification as its ontological premise… transform[ing] both the user and
               the system’ (<a href="#B2">Barnett et al., 2016</a>). Such
               work imagines technological systems and projects that ‘[do] not yet exist and
               may never come to exist [… do] not yet function and may never function’
               (<a href="#B2">Barnett et al., 2016</a>). The other side of
               the debate explores how current technological systems and tools already contain
               elements that encourage queer modes of analysis. For example, work by Jacob Gaboury
               explores how the ‘NULL value’ in computation signals a ‘refusal to
               cohere, to become legible’ as a built-in option in computational systems.
               Gaboury explains how the NULL value ‘corresponds with the epistemological
               condition of queerness as an excessive illegibility collapsed into an unwieldy
               frame, an aberrant third-ness within an otherwise normative system of
               relations’ (<a href="#B10">Gaboury, 2018</a>). In another
               project, ‘The Queer History of Computing’, Gaboury exposes and
               interrogates the ways in which technology creates opportunities for resisting
               conscription within its systems. Gaboury asserts that ‘there exists a
               structuring logic to computational systems that, while nearly totalizing, does not
               account for all forms of knowledge, which excludes certain acts, behaviors, and
               modes of being’ (<a href="#B9">Gaboury, 2013: para.
                  13</a>). According to Gaboury, it is from within this structuring logic that
               queerness finds the space to operate.</p>
            <p id="d5e102">In an attempt to cut between these debates, this project first searches for a
               structural constraint within the TEI format, and then works through this constraint
               to analyze the homoerotic elements in Wilde’s manuscript revisions. As such,
               this project aligns with another that uses the TEI to destabilize our current
               understanding of Wilde’s textual and historical legacy. Jason A. Boyd’s
               Texting Wilde Project uses the TEI to mark up the biographical information,
               particularly references to persons, places, and events, in writings about
               Wilde’s life. Its goal is to reveal the historical discrepencies and
               inaccuracies across Wilde’s biography. Boyd points out that ‘Our
               knowledge of “Oscar Wilde” is not comprised of a corpus of pure and
               simple facts that allows us an unmediated apprehension of a real person separated
               from us by only time, but rather this knowledge is comprised of a densely complex
               and often contradictory accretion of texts’ (<a href="#B5">Boyd, 2014: para. 1</a>).</p>
            <p id="d5e107">Similar to Boyd, my project also uses the TEI to complicate the understanding of
               Wilde’s textual legacy. It identifies one major constraint of the TEI: that it
               works best with data that is discrete, rather than smooth data, like the
               homoeroticism obscured by Wilde’s pen. Here, I apply the rigid constraint of
               the TEI data structure towards marking up and analyzing this text’s
               homoeroticism, which I group into the general themes of ‘intimacy’,
               ‘beauty’, ‘passion’, and ‘fatality’, as well as
               the pen strokes that Wilde used to strike these elements from the text. The
               functionality of the TEI as a tool that bounds and labels data into discrete
               elements allows me to explore the indeterminate boundaries of these queer themes in
               the text. The strict nature of this tool compels literary researchers like myself
               to
               see how working with textual data in electronic formats will surface that which
               evades their grasp.</p>

            <p id="d5e110">To inform my approach for handling homoerotic subject matter within digital contexts,
               I bring two fields, Textual Scholarship and Queer Historiography, into conversation.
               The debates within these fields allow me to carve out a methodology for digitizing
               what electronic editing scholar Jerome McGann calls our ‘textual
               inheritance’ (<a href="#B19">McGann, 2001: xi</a>). Here,
               I identify a parallel debate between what I term the ‘restorative’ and
               ‘productive’ approaches to Textual Scholarship and Queer Historiography.
               In the field of Textual Scholarship, the restorative approach promotes editorial
               practices that increasingly delimit the role of the editor as a recoverer or
               preserver of texts, while the productive approach empowers the editor as an enabler
               of potential textual readings. The history of Textual Scholarship first tends toward
               the restorative approach, beginning with the work of Shakepearean scholar Ronald B.
               McKerrow, who maintains that the goal of scholarly editing is to preserve authorial
               intention. McKerrow’s influential model for ‘copy-text’ editing,
               which establishes the base-text for editing on an early witness that most closely
               resembles the author’s original intention, eventually gives way to Walter W.
               Greg’s approach that expands the purview of critics to more than a single
               witness. Subsequently, Fredson Bowers and Thomas Tanselle advance Greg’s work,
               proposing the ‘eclectic edition’ as the format that enables the editor
               to distil authorial intention from multiple sources.<a href="#n1">1</a> Tanselle, in particular, enshrines the role of the editor as the only
               figure capable of realizing the ‘work’ in its ideal form:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e118"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e119">Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without questioning the
                  constitution of a particular written or oral text of it are behaving as if the
                  work were directly accessible on paper or in sound waves … its medium is
                  neither visual nor auditory. The medium of literature is the words (whether
                  already existent or newly created) of a language; and arrangements of words
                  according to the syntax of some language (along with such aids to their
                  interpretation as pauses or punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not
                  they are reported by voice or in writing. (<a href="#B23">Tanselle, 1989: 16–17</a>)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e124">Because the act of inscription involves physical tools that corrupt the
               writer’s pure ideas, the writer requires an editor whose distance from the
               creation of the work enables his objective evaluation of its intention.
               Tanselle’s prioritization of textual recovery exemplifies the restorative
               approach.</p>
            <p id="d5e125">Toward the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, D. F. McKenzie’s ideas about
               ‘the sociology of texts’ challenge the claim that a single text can
               represent an ‘ideal’ version. According to McKenzie, the book is never
               one single object but stems from a number of human agencies and mechanical
               techniques that are historically situated: ‘Every society rewrites its past,
               every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have any continuing life at all, at
               some point every printer redesigns them’ (<a href="#B20">McKenzie, 1986: 25</a>). Jerome McGann expands this sociological perspective
               into digital editing environments, where electronic formats create opportunities for
               presenting textual variation. McGann explains that textual criticism in print format
               is limited because a print text must conform to the linear and two-dimensional form
               of the codex: the same form as its object of study. Digital editions, by contrast,
               can be designed for complex, reflexive, and ongoing interactions between reader and
               text. McGann notes that his work on the digital <i>Rossetti Archive</i>
               brought him to repeatedly reconsider his earlier conception and goals, explaining
               that the archive ‘seemed more and more an instrument for imagining what we
               didn’t know’ (<a href="#B19">McGann, 2001: 82</a>).
               McGann’s approach counters the traditional fidelity toward authorial intention
               with a drive to harness the potentiality of textual variation. The transformation
               of
               literary material into electronic format becomes a vehicle for a critical analytical
               method that McGann and Lisa Samuels call ‘deformative criticism’, which
               works by distorting, disordering, or re-assembling literary material in order to
               estrange the reader from their familiarity of the text. Continually subscribing the
               text to new configurations, this estrangement confronts the reader with new insights
               about its formal significance and meaning. For that reason, deformative criticism
               encourages a productive approach to editing.</p>

         <div class="section"><a id="d5e138"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">Queer Historiography</h2>
            <p id="d5e140">Two competing approaches in the field of Queer Historiography parallel the
               ‘restorative’ and ‘productive’ approaches from Textual
               Scholarship. Susan McCabe defines ‘Queer Historicism’ as the
               ‘critical trend of locating “identifications” (rather than
               identity), modes of being and having, in historical contexts’ (<a href="#B18">McCabe, 2005: 120</a>). In this field, critics
               often debate the extent to which they, in the present, can adequately describe queer
               identifications from the past. On the ‘restorative’ side, there is the
               Queer Historicist position advocated by scholars like David Halperin and Valerie
               Traub, who maintain that homosexuality is historically constructed; that
               ‘queerness’ means something different today than it did in the past, and
               that we can get at its meaning by employing a Foucauldian genealogical method that
               traces its meaning over time. Halperin, in particular, characterizes homosexual
               identity as a modern cultural production: ‘no single category of discourse or
               experience existed in the premodern and non-Western worlds that comprehended exactly
               the same range of same-sex sexual behaviors … that now fall within the
               capacious definitional boundaries of homosexuality’ (<a href="#B13">Halperin, 2000: 88</a>). By contrast, the
               ‘unhistoricists’, including Jonathan Goldberg and Madhavi Menon, are
               wary of demarcating queer subjectivity across history in ways that imply progress.
               These scholars maintain that the attempt to define ‘queer’ would
               subscribe queerness to heteronormative teleology, which has the effect of
               normalizing (and therefore evacuating) queerness: ‘to produce queerness as an
               object of our scrutiny would mean the end of queering itself’ (1609, 1608). In
               response to this unhistoricist position, Valerie Traub maintains that
               ‘queer’ depends on historical specificity:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e148"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e149">Queer’s free-floating, endlessly mobile, and infinitely subversive
                  capacities may be strengths—allowing queer to accomplish strategic
                  maneuvers that no other concept does—but its principled imprecision
                  implies analytic limitations … if queer is intelligible only in relation
                  to its social norms, and if the concept of normality itself is of relatively
                  recent vintage (Locherie), then the relations between queer and the changing
                  configurations of gender and sexuality need to be defined and redefined. (<a href="#B26">Traub, 2013: 33</a>)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e154">According to Traub, queerness requires historical specificity in order to be legible.
               If applied ahistorically, the term ‘queer’ would lose its descriptive
               value. This position aligns the historicists with the restorative impulse in Textual
               Scholarship, while the unhistoricist refusal to circumscribe such a definition
               recalls the productive approach.</p>
            <p id="d5e155">Heather Love refocuses this methodological debate to emphasize the relationship
               between the critic and the object of study. Love makes the argument that, although
               the queer historian cannot validate the queerness of the past, the project of queer
               history must continue. Love explains that ‘Queer history has been an education
               in absence: the experience of social refusal and of the denigration of homosexual
               love has taught us the lessons of solitude and heartbreak’ (<a href="#B17">Love, 2009: 52</a>). Her methodology takes negative
               affects like shame, anger, disgust, hatred, disappointment as phenomena that cannot
               be resolved, recuperated, or rescued by the queer historian because queer subjects
               will always fail to fit within contemporary conceptions of identity and desire.
               Rather than attempt to ‘fix’ the past, however, Love offers the
               methodology of ‘feeling backward’, an accounting of ‘the social,
               psychic, and corporeal effects of homophobia’ (2). By ‘feeling
               backward’, Love is interested in exploring the way that subjects turn away or
               refuse the critic’s attempt to ‘redeem’ or ‘rescue’
               them: she offers the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, pointing out that Orpheus
               <i>prefers</i> to behold Eurydice in the darkness of the Underworld
               rather than in the sunlight.<a href="#n2">2</a> Although Orpheus
               intends to rescue her, bringing Eurydice into the light of day would transform her
               into something fully accessible and therefore less desirable. This is a crucial
               lesson for queer critics: ‘[Eurydice’s] specific attraction for queer
               subjects is an effect, I want to argue, of a historical experience of love as bound
               up with loss. To recognize Eurydice as desirable in her turn away is a way of
               identifying through that loss’ (<a href="#B17">Love, 2009:
                  51</a>).</p>
            <p id="d5e169">Plagued by the problem of what to do with the past, the critic’s impulse to
               ‘rescue’ queer figures evokes Tanselle’s aim to recover the ideal
               text in scholarly editing. Love, however, asserts that this rescue is
               impossible:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e170"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e171">Such is the relation of the queer historian to the past: we cannot help wanting
                  to save the figures from the past, but this mission is doomed to fail. In part,
                  this is because the dead are gone for good; in part, because the queer past is
                  even more remote, more deeply marked by power’s claw… Such a rescue
                  effort can only take place under the shadow of loss and in the name of loss;
                  success would constitute failure. (<a href="#B17">Love, 2009:
                     51</a>)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e176">Perhaps this impossibility allows the critic to rethink how she might preserve the
               queer textual inheritance: accepting queerness as something that eludes containment
               compels her to explore how queerness escapes certain kinds of analyses. Love
               suggests ‘a mode of historiography that recognizes the inevitability of a
               “play of recognitions” but that also sees these recognitions not as
               consoling but as shattering’ (<a href="#B17">Love, 2009:
                  45</a>). By ‘play of recognitions’, Love means the inevitable
               ‘search for roots and resemblances’ enacted by the critic when she
               encounters queer subject matter (45). I propose that this method of attending to
               elusive affects, without trying to transform them into something more palatable, can
               apply to digital contexts and toward productive ends. One may, borrowing from McGann
               and Samuel’s idea of deformance, reconceive textual editing as a formal
               experiment. The TEI can be used to explore how electronic editing tools impose new
               formal structures on queer subject matter. This allows one to take the attempt at
               recovery and, rather than aim for resolution, multiply the potential readings of
               textual elements. Using the TEI in this way allows researchers to direct
               ‘queer encoding’ practices toward enacting what Kadji Amin, Amber
               Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez describe as ‘queer form’, or
               ‘the range of formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies that make difference
               a little less knowable, visible, and digestible’ (<a href="#B1">2017: 235</a>).</p>
            <p id="d5e184">My work encoding Wilde’s revisions to the manuscript plays against the
               long-standing ‘recovery’ project about Wilde’s intentions as he
               revises <i>Dorian Gray</i> into the periodical and book versions. Textual
               scholars like Donald Lawler, Joseph Bristow and Nicolas Ruddick claim that
               Wilde’s revisions work toward the overall goal of aestheticizing the text.
               This project of aestheticization begins in the manuscript which is eventually
               published, in periodical form, in <i>Lippincott’s Monthly
                  Magazine</i> on June 20, 1890.<a href="#n3">3</a> This
               first printing of ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’, which spans 98 pages
               over 13 chapters, was widely criticized in the press for its seemingly ambiguous
               stance on an immoral protagonist. Bristow explains that ‘[Wilde’s]
               narrative struck the [reviewers] as a work that appeared “corrupt”,
               displayed “effeminate frivolity”, and dealt “with matters only
               fitted for the Criminal Investigation Department”’ (<a href="#B28">2000: xviii</a>). Wilde spends the next several
               days defending his work in letters to the editors, entering into a public
               correspondence with them.<a href="#n4">4</a> A few months later,
               in the early spring of 1891, Wilde publishes a ‘Preface’ that makes such
               claims as ‘Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt
               without being charming. This is a fault’ and ‘To reveal art and conceal
               the artist is art’s aim’.<a href="#n5">5</a> Scholar
               Barbara Lecklie asserts that, by these complex and incisive statements,
               ‘Wilde’s strategy is to refocus on art and disparage the focus on the
               reader by saying that the reader is the one who makes a work immoral’ (2013:
               173). Similarly, Lawler argues that ‘the “Preface” … hold[s]
               up aesthetic beauty and artistic effect as the only legitimate criteria of critical
               evaluation’ (<a href="#B15">1988: 16</a>). The
               ‘Preface’ is included in the subsequent iteration of <i>Dorian
                  Gray</i>, published in a book version by Ward, Lock &amp; Company in April
               1891. According to the editor of the <i>Uncensored Edition</i> of
               <i>Dorian Gray</i>, Victor Frankel, Wilde here makes significant
               deletions of passages referencing homosexuality, promiscuous or illicit
               heterosexuality, and ‘anything that smacked generally of decadence’
               (<a href="#B29">2011: 47–48</a>). Wilde also
               ‘heighten[s] Dorian’s monstrosity toward the novel’s
               conclusion’ to bring the story ‘to a moral conclusion that he thought
               would silence his critics’ (Frankel, 2011:30).</p>

               and <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tags indicate deleted text. Through this
               level of detail, TEI facilitates deep and complex description of textual material
               that facilitates scholarly research. This excerpt also includes a
               <code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> tag and <code>@hand</code>
               attribute, which indicate whose ‘hand’ is responsible for writing each
               section of text: a valuable piece of information for a text co-edited by
               Shelley’s husband, Percy Shelley.</p>
            <p id="d5e259">TEI documents resemble an ordered hierarchy containing a nested tree structure, with
               one ‘root’ component and several ‘branches’, known as
               ‘nodes’. The TEI requires all elements in the text to be contained as
               discrete nodes within this bounded structure, and elements cannot overlap unless the
               inner element is fully nested within an outer element. Though the strict tagging
               structure of the TEI forces encoders to organize textual elements as discrete,
               ordered data, it also enables them to create their own labels for the elements.
               Perhaps the most useful aspect about the TEI is this customizability, which it
               inherits from its parent language, eXtensible Markup Language (XML). As an
               ‘extensible’ language, TEI users can create their own tags to describe
               the particular elements they wish to encode. <i>The Women Writers Project
                  (WWP)</i>, directed by Julia Flanders, adequately frames how TEI’s
               inherent extensibility can address textual ambiguity. According to the
               <i>WWP</i>:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e267"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e268">Unlike many standardization efforts, the TEI … explicitly accommodat[es]
                  variation and debate within its technical framework. The TEI Guidelines are
                  designed to be both modular and customizable, so that specific projects can
                  choose the relevant portions of the TEI and ignore the rest, and can also if
                  necessary create extensions of the TEI language to describe facets of the text
                  which the TEI does not yet address. (<a href="#B8">Flanders,
                     1999–2021</a>)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e273">Because TEI is built from a language that allows its users to build their own version
               of that language, there is potential for representing the elements necessary for a
               project by customizing these elements on a project-by-project basis.</p>
            <p id="d5e274">As queer studies scholars may know, however, some textual elements will resist
               containment within any kind of category. Accordingly, there are a number of projects
               that explore the potential of the TEI for ‘queer encoding’, such as the
               encoding of queer gender. The <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> tag, which
               describes persons referenced within a text, is limited to one value for gender,
               which creates obstacles for scholars working to encode multiple or diverse sexual
               identities. Pamela Caughie and Sabine Meyer, for example, use the the TEI to encode
               <i>Man Into Woman</i>, the life narrative of Danish painter Lili Elbe,
               who undertook one of the first gender affirming surgeries in 1930. The attempt to
               mark up Elbe’s complex gender ontology brings Caughie and Meyer against this
               structural limitation of the TEI:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e281"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e282">[T]he deeper we got into mark-up, the more evident it became that the categories
                  and hierarchies available to us were inadequate for our task… to identify
                  a male subject who at times presents himself as masquerading as a woman, at
                  others as being inhabited by one, and who eventually becomes a woman, in a life
                  history narrated retrospectively from the perspective of Lili Elbe. (Caughie and
                  Meyer, 2018: 231)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e283">The TEI forces these scholars to consider the ways that computation works on a deeper
               level to reify gender as essential. In particular, the fixity that the TEI imposes
               upon Elbe as a queer subject brings out the ways that gender is situated and
               relational across this text.</p>
            <p id="d5e285">Other scholars find advantage in the TEI’s strict data structure. While the TEI
               limits what constitutes a person—as an entity with one sex, for
               example—it also enables an approach toward personhood as multiple. Like
               Caughie and Meyer, Marion Thain also works to encode the diaries of a complex
               writing subject: the late 19th-century English poet, Michael Field. Michael Field
               is
               a pen name for the lesbian couple, Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, which
               signifies ‘the assumed names of two separate women, as well as appearing to
               signify one single male identity’ (<a href="#B24">Thain,
                  2016: 228</a>). Fortunately for Thain, the TEI enables the encoding of
               distinct identities, which is central for understanding the queerness of the
               diaries:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e290"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e291">[T]he proliferation and slipperiness of names is no mere childish caprice but a
                  core part of the articulation of queer: an unhinging of ‘given’ or
                  apparently predetermined identity through a strategy that articulates identity
                  as constantly shifting, constructed, and performative. Text encoding can, in a
                  simple but powerful way, help us explore and map this crucial strand of queer
                  identity construction across the diary. (<a href="#B24">Thain,
                     2016: 233</a>)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e296">Thain’s approach harnesses the hierarchical nature of the TEI to list the
               various references to each personage within the
               <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> tag. This
               <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> tag allows Thain to ‘render
               searchable words not in the text but intimately tied to it. This is not a small
               issue in a diary in which Katharine Bradley herself is referred to by more than 20
               different names’ (<a href="#B24">Thain, 2016: 233</a>). By
               enabling Thain to encode multiple names for each writer of the text, the TEI data
               structure enables Thain to manage the problem of queer identity in this text.</p>
            <p id="d5e305">Why do Caughie and Meyer struggle to encode Elbe’s identity while Thain appears
               to succeed with Fields’? While a queerness like Fields’ might be
               delineated and contained, in Elbe’s there is a quality of blending which the
               markup, by its nature, means to separate and fix. As Flanders points out, markup is
               a tool for naming, bounding, and containment, and therefore registers information
               in
               distinct components (<a href="#B7">Flanders, 2017</a>).
               Fields’ identity is multiple yet distinct: the diaries proffer ‘two
               different hands [that] record the experience of two clearly differentiated
               people’ (<a href="#B24">Thain, 2016: 229</a>). By
               contrast, Elbe’s identity is plural, containing several identities whose
               relationship to each other is ambiguous or continually shifting within one entity.
               Elbe’s relation to gender is best described qualitatively, as one that
               alternatively ‘masquerades’ or ‘inhabits’ simultaneous
               gender ontologies (Caughie and Meyer, 2018: 231).</p>

            <p id="d5e318">For Wilde’s text in particular, I created a customization that explores the
               potential of semantic labelling against the demands for fixity and structure within
               the TEI schema. My customization registers physical and conceptual changes to the
               manuscript by creating two new attributes to mark the revisions. First, to mark the
               physical traces of Wilde’s pen as he struck out portions of the text, the
               custom attribute, ‘strokes’ (<code>@strokes</code> in formal
               TEI notation), registers the number of pen strokes through any given section of
               text.<a href="#n6">6</a> Most often, Wilde uses one or two
               strokes of his pen, although sometimes, the strokes are too heavy or thick to
               enumerate. In those cases, I set the <code>@strokes</code> attribute to
               the value ‘inconclusive’. In addition to
               <code>@strokes</code>, the custom attribute
               <code>@implication</code> marks the general theme of revision from a
               list of recurring themes, which include: ‘intimacy’,
               ‘beauty’, ‘passion’, and ‘fatality’, with the
               additional values of ‘inconclusive’ or ‘illegible’.</p>
            <p id="d5e331">In what follows, I detail how this customization registers the elisions of
               homoeroticism in the manuscript as Wilde prepared it for publication. The goal of
               this work is not to establish a formal method for marking queer elements, rather,
               it
               is to surface a resistance in the text: an indeterminacy that resists capture by the
               TEI data structure. Here, the difficulty is in engaging the boundedness of the TEI
               elements, which encapsulate data, with the indistinctiveness of the queerness of the
               text, which resist demarcation. The four themes of ‘intimacy’,
               ‘beauty’, ‘passion’, and ‘fatality’ constitute a
               spectrum of smooth information that threatens the confines of the TEI tags. To add
               another layer of ambiguity, the number of pen strokes also resists easy demarcation:
               they can be difficult to enumerate and their boundaries often fail to map with the
               themes. Therefore, in order to mark up this text, I impose decisions on the
               data.</p>
            <p id="d5e332">The evocative opening scene, which consists of a lively dialogue between Basil
               Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton, sets the tone, reveals character dynamics, and lays
               out some of the conflict for the ensuing story. In these first few pages, Basil
               appears to be a sympathetic, sensitive, albeit slightly exasperated artist, who
               confides in his close friend Lord Henry the powerful influence that Dorian Gray has
               had upon his life and work. Lord Henry, by contrast, appears as an affable and witty
               gentleman aesthete, who counters Basil’s sincerity with offbeat observations
               and paradoxical aphorisms. From the revisions made to this opening scene, a few
               general patterns emerge. First, the revisions work to stifle the emotional tension
               and physical affection in the dialogue between Basil and Lord Henry, replacing it
               with a lighter or more neutral tone. Because these revisions generally shore up the
               friendship between Basil and Lord Henry, conveying fondness in their rapport, they
               are encoded according to the theme of ‘intimacy’. Second are the themes
               of ‘beauty’ and ‘passion’, which mostly concern revisions
               where Dorian is reformulated from a romantic object into an artistic subject for
               Basil’s painting. Third, and finally, is the theme of ‘fatality’,
               which emerges in moments where Basil struggles to explain the consuming and
               self-destructive effects of Dorian’s influence on his life.</p>
            <p id="d5e333">On the theme of intimacy, Wilde’s pen slashes through evidence of physical
               contact between Basil, Lord Henry, and Dorian. This includes the following:
               ‘taking hold of his [Lord Henry’s] hand’ (9), Dorian’s
               ‘cheek just brushed my [Basil’s] cheek’ (20), Basil and Dorian
               ‘sit beside each other’ (22). Additionally, the dialogue between Basil
               and Lord Henry develops intimacy through their tone and subtle mannerisms, which
               facilitates Basil’s confession of his feelings for Dorian. In some cases,
               Wilde diminishes this intimacy in their conversation with the effect of mitigating
               the sense of foreboding that surrounds Basil’s attraction to Dorian. Here,
               Wilde replaces tense pauses with laughter or exchanges dramatic statements and
               descriptions with more playful ones. One such example occurs when Basil struggles
               to
               convey his reasoning for refusing to exhibit Dorian’s portrait:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e334"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e335">‘The reason why I will not exhibit this picture, is that I am afraid that I
                  have shown in it the secret of my own soul.’</p>
               <p id="d5e336">Lord Henry hesitated for a moment. ‘And what is that?’ he asked, in a
                  low voice. ‘I will tell you,’ said Hallward, and a look of pain came
                  over his face. ‘Don’t if you would rather not,’ murmured his
                  companion, looking at him. (9)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e337">The revised version in the manuscript, incorporating the deletions and interlinear
               additions, reads:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e338"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e339">‘The reason why I will not exhibit this picture, is that I am afraid that I
                  have shown in it the secret of my own soul.’</p>
               <p id="d5e340">Lord Henry laughed. ‘And what is that?’ he asked. ‘I will tell
                  you,’ said Hallward, and an expression of perplexity came over his face.
                  ‘I am all expectation Basil,’ murmured his companion, looking at
                  him. (9)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e341">Here, several changes mitigate the emotions of the scene. First, rather than
               ‘hesitate’, Lord Henry ‘laugh[s]’, and he no longer speaks
               ‘in a low voice’. The effect is to overwrite a previously intimate
               moment with levity. Basil also exchanges his facial expression from one of agony to
               confusion when ‘a look of pain’ transforms into ‘an expression of
               perplexity’. Lastly, Lord Henry, rather than sympathizing with Basil or
               excusing his obligation to explain himself, instead encourages him to speak:
               ‘I am all expectation, Basil’. Together, these changes work to obscure
               Basil’s internal suffering with the effect of lightening the mood of the
               scene.</p>
            <p id="d5e342">Another example similarly tempers the intense, emotional energy while also mitigating
               a sense of anxiety or foreboding. It occurs on the following page, where Basil is
               on
               the verge of revealing the reasons behind his attraction to Dorian. The original
               dialogue proceeds: ‘Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s
               heart beating, and he heard his own breath, with a sense almost of fear. “Yes.
               There is very little to tell you,” whispered Hallward, “and I am afraid
               you will be disappointed. Two months ago…”’ (10). The
               manuscript’s revised version reads: ‘Lord Henry felt as if he could hear
               Basil Hallward’s heart beating, and he wondered what was coming. “Yes.
               There is very little to tell you,” whispered Hallward rather bitterly,
               ‘and I dare say you will be disappointed. Two months ago…”’
               (10). Here, rather than draw attention to Lord Henry’s breathing, Wilde
               mentions Lord Henry’s ‘wonder’ about Basil’s pending
               explanation, which shifts Lord Henry’s sense of anticipation from fear to
               curiosity. Wilde also makes slight changes to Basil’s delivery: in the revised
               version, Basil speaks ‘rather bitterly’ and uses the expression ‘I
               dare say’ rather than ‘I am afraid’. Both changes diminish the
               confessional tone that originally precedes Basil’s revelation about Dorian
               Gray. In this change, and in the aforementioned passage, the close rapport, the
               ‘intimacy’, between Basil and Lord Henry enables Basil’s
               confession about the self-consuming qualities of his feelings for Dorian, which
               suggests a connection to the theme of ‘fatality’. The data structure of
               the TEI, however, fails to capture this complicated dynamic because the
               <code>@implication</code> attribute is limited to one value.
               Therefore, the encoder must choose one theme per item of revision, either
               ‘intimacy’ or ‘fatality’.</p>
            <p id="d5e346">Throughout this chapter, Wilde often swaps out words with the effect of diluting or
               diverting their original connotation. He focuses this type of revision on
               Basil’s dialogue, when Basil speaks about his passionate attachment to Dorian
               and the effect of Dorian’s beauty upon his art. Here, Wilde trades expressive
               nouns with words that convey relatively weaker or more generalized ideas. For
               example, in the sentence ‘Every portrait that is painted with passion is a
               portrait of the artist, not of the sitter’, Wilde replaces
               ‘passion’ with ‘feeling’ in the manuscript (9), exchanging
               the romantic connotation of ‘passion’ with the more neutral one of
               ‘feeling’. Additionally, on the theme of ‘passion’, Wilde
               substitutes words and phrases which connote a strong sense of romantic passion for
               ones that instead suggest an aesthetic interest. One line, prior to revision, reads:
               ‘I knew that I had … come across someone whose mere personality was so
               fascinating that it would be Lord over my life, my soul, my art itself’ (11).
               Wilde revises this line to: ‘I knew that I had come face to face with someone
               whose mere personality was so fascinating that it would absorb my nature, my soul,
               my art itself’ (11). Here, Wilde swaps out ‘life’ for
               ‘nature’, with the effect of subscribing Dorian’s influence to his
               ‘nature’, that is, part of his personality or behavior, rather than
               encompassing his ‘life’. Wilde also replaces ‘be Lord over’
               with ‘absorb’, which maintains Basil’s sense of submission to an
               external force without the patriarchal designation in ‘Lord’. These
               changes, which are encoded under the theme of ‘passion’, diffuse a
               consuming quality in Basil’s attraction into a sensitivity to Dorian’s
               aesthetic influence. Like the revisions to the theme of ‘intimacy’, the
               subtle changes of word choice in this section also begin to gesture to the theme of
               fatality, which fully develops over the next several pages.</p>
            <p id="d5e348">In addition to words associated with ‘passion’, Wilde often replaces the
               word ‘beauty’ in Basil’s references to Dorian. In doing so, Wilde
               neutralizes the power of Dorian’s physical allure. For example, Wilde changes
               ‘Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose
               <i>beauty</i> had so stirred me’ to ‘Suddenly I found
               myself face to face with the young man whose <i>personality</i> had so
               strangely stirred me’ (13, my emphasis). The replacement of
               ‘beauty’ with ‘personality’ allows Basil to avoid mentioning
               Dorian’s physical appearance, and the addition of ‘strangely’
               serves to mystify Dorian’s influence over Basil. Throughout the rest of
               chapter, Wilde makes several changes that similarly dilute Dorian’s powerful
               appearance: he replaces ‘beauty’ with ‘good looks’ and then
               with ‘face’ two separate times (6, 18). Finally, in reference to Dorian
               Gray, the word ‘Narcissus’ is replaced with ‘man’ (13). Like
               the previous changes on the theme of ‘passion’, the changes in words
               associated with ‘beauty’ shift the original connotation. Here, the
               decision to replace ‘beauty’ with references to ‘face’ or
               ‘good looks’ maintains the emphasis on the physical while muting the
               suggestive power of ‘beauty’ in the abstract. In doing so, connotations
               about the ideal, the charming, and the alluring, which usually accompany
               descriptions of beauty, are diffused into physical description. This evacuates
               Dorian’s mysterious allure and diminishes the overwhelming influence that he
               holds over Basil.</p>
            <p id="d5e356">Removing associations with beauty and passion is part of Wilde’s larger effort
               of aestheticizing Dorian, transforming him from an erotic object into an aesthetic
               object. At the end of the first chapter, Basil implores Lord Henry to refrain from
               influencing the impressionable youth. The original version reads:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e357"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e358">‘Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life lovely for
                  me. Mind, Harry, I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed
                  wrung out of him, almost against his will.</p>
               <p id="d5e359">‘I don’t suppose I shall care for him, and I am quite sure he
                  won’t care for me,’ replied Lord Henry smiling, and he took Hallward
                  by the arm, and almost led him into the house. (27–28)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e360">Lord Henry’s assurance that neither he nor Dorian shall ‘care for’
               each other characterizes Basil’s passionate feelings for Dorian as a kind of
               general possessiveness. However, the source of Basil’s anxiety is specified
               with the next revision:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e361"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e362">‘Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life absolutely
                  lovely to me, and that gives my art whatever wonder or charm it possesses. Mind.
                  Harry, I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out
                  of him almost against his will.</p>
               <p id="d5e363">‘What nonsense you talk,’ said Lord Henry smiling, and, taking
                  Hallward by the arm, he almost led him to the house. (27, 27B)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e364">In this revision, Basil attributes an aesthetic value to Dorian, asserting
               Dorian’s importance for his art, giving it ‘whatever wonder or charm it
               possesses’. Lord Henry’s response moves from reassurance to dismissal,
               rejecting Basil’s anxiety as ‘nonsense’ and ending the scene on a
               slightly humorous note. Across these changes, Wilde refocuses Basil’s jealous
               passion into an anxiety about losing Dorian as an artistic subject. Additionally,
               the shift from sincere reassurance to light-hearted repartee in Lord Henry’s
               response evacuates the strong emotional tone of the scene, replacing it with
               friendly banter. The effect is to divert Basil’s passion for Dorian toward
               aesthetic appreciation.</p>
            <p id="d5e365">Wilde’s efforts in redirecting Basil’s passion toward artistic ends is
               inextricable from the attempts to soften Basil’s intense and consuming
               devotion to Dorian, which emerges in references to Basil’s troubled state of
               mind. One example occurs when Basil recounts his first time meeting Dorian: ‘I
               had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite
               sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to him, I would never leave him till either he or
               I
               were dead. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room’ (12). Here,
               Basil’s passion swells with an intense, life-threatening quality that
               Wilde’s pen works to mitigate by removing the association with death. He
               crosses through ‘never leave him till either he or I were dead’ and adds
               ‘become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought not to speak to
               him’. Wilde again tempers this self-consuming quality of Basil’s
               devotion when he changes the phrase ‘I could not live if I did not see him
               every day’ to ‘I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every
               day’ (17). By shifting the focus from Basil’s ‘life’ to his
               happiness, Wilde dilutes the profound peril that Basil’s passion has
               generated.</p>
            <p id="d5e366">The TEI data structure reinforces the difficulty of disambiguating the revisions
               within the themes of passion and fatality. In the phrase discussed above,
               ‘look of pain’ is revised to ‘an expression of perplexity’
               (9).<a href="#n7">7</a> Working with this revision in the TEI
               presents two points of contention (see <a href="#F2">Figure
                  2</a>). First, in categorizing the theme, does the phrase ‘look of
               pain’ express passion or fatality? On the one hand, ‘pain’ denotes
               a strong, passionate feeling; on the other, Basil often draws on pain in his
               references to the fatalistic qualities about his attraction to Dorian, as in the
               following quote which was deleted: ‘I feel, Harry, that I have given away my
               whole soul to someone seems to take a real delight in giving me pain’ (23).
               The difficulty of disambiguating the theme is mirrored by the strokes of
               Wilde’s pen, which vary even across the same phrase: while the word
               ‘look’ is struck so heavily that the number of strokes is inconclusive,
               the word ‘pain’ contains a single stroke. With the TEI, it is impossible
               to mark the variations in strokes without separating the single revision into two
               instances, which would break up the integrity of the phrase. Therefore, it is marked
               with the value ‘inconclusive’. The ambiguity in the number of strokes
               also deepens when considering the semantics of the revision: the heavier strokes are
               focused on a revision (‘look’ to ‘expression’) that carries
               less semantic weight than the single stroke (‘pain’ to
               ‘perplexity’). In this case, the labelling fails to register even
               suggest the ways that different components are interrelated. The reasoning behind
               the relationship between the themes and the strokes remains recalcitrant.</p>

            <p id="d5e379">My final example concerns a longer passage that was heavily revised in the
               manuscript.<a href="#n8">8</a> The treatment of this passage
               crystallizes the various patterns of revision seen so far—diminishing signs of
               intimacy, passion, and references to Basil’s fatalism. The passage in the
               manuscript bears quoting in full. Prior to any revisions, it reads:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d5e384"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="d5e385">‘You remember that landscape of mine… It is one of the best things I
                  have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray
                  sat beside me, and as he leaned across to look at it, his cheek just brushed my
                  cheek. The world becomes young to me when I hold his hand, as when I see him,
                  the centuries yield up all their secrets!’</p>
               <p id="d5e386">‘Basil, this is [illegible] you must not talk [illegible] [illegible] his
                  power, [indecipherable] to make yourself the [illegible] slave! It is worse than
                  wicked, it is silly. I hate Dorian Gray.’</p>
               <p id="d5e387">Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the garden. A curious smile
                  curled his lips. He seemed like a man in a dream. After some time he came back.
                  ‘You don’t understand, Harry…’ he said. ‘Dorian
                  Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more present in my work then
                  when no image of him is there. He is simply a suggestion, as I have said, of a
                  new manner. I see him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and
                  subtleties of certain colours. That is all.’</p>
               <p id="d5e388">‘Then why won’t you exhibit his picture?’</p>
               <p id="d5e389">‘Because I have put into it the romance of which I have never dared to
                  speak to him. He knows nothing about it, but the world might guess it, where
                  there is merely love, they would see something evil, where there is spectacular
                  passion, they would suggest something vile.’ (20–21)</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d5e391">The TEI surfaces Wilde’s layers of revision in this passage (see <a href="#F3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#F4">4</a>). In the first paragraph, Wilde eliminates a span of text from
               ‘and as he leaned’ to ‘secrets!’. Within this span, Wilde
               makes additional changes, adding text such as ‘hair just touched my
               hand’. Due to its physical nature, this particular phrase is marked as
               ‘intimacy’ in the TEI, while the longer section is enclosed by the label
               of ‘passion’, which denotes the nature of the other revisions within the
               same sentence, like ‘The world becomes young to me when I hold his
               hand’. Here, the TEI enables a layered approach to markup where one element
               can be nested within another.</p>

            <p id="d5e409">While the first paragraph is legible, the next one, by contrast, is almost completely
               blotted out. It consists of Lord Henry’s condemnatory and jealous
               protestations: ‘his power’, ‘to make yourself the …
               slave!’ and ‘I hate Dorian Gray’. Here, Wilde obscures the
               fatalistic connotations of Basil’s passion, which exasperate Lord Henry.
               Accordingly, the <code>@implication</code> is marked as
               ‘fatality’ and the <code>@strokes</code> are marked as
               ‘inconclusive’.</p>
            <p id="d5e415">Most of the third paragraph is preserved, presumably for how it furthers
               Dorian’s aestheticization. Here, Basil elaborates upon Dorian’s
               aesthetic influence, which inspires his apprehension of the natural world. In the
               following paragraph, however, Wilde again obscures much of language, which revolves
               around the themes of passion and fatality. On the theme of fatality, the small
               adjustment of ‘would’ to ‘might’ eliminates a sense of
               inevitability about Basil’s feelings for Dorian. On the theme of passion, the
               revelatory line: ‘where there is merely love, they would see something evil,
               where there is spectacular passion, they would suggest something vile’ is
               completely struck out. This statement clarifies Dorian’s importance for Basil
               as the source of a powerful allure that suffuses Basil’s art with beauty.
               Notably, the strokes over the phrase ‘suggest something vile’ are
               doubled, which cannot be encoded in the TEI without separating the revision into two
               instances. As with the deletion of ‘look of pain’ (9), marking each
               element here with precision would require separating into distinct entities what is
               in fact one act of revision that contains plural implications. It would involve
               resolving Wilde’s perhaps indeterminate motives into a single intention.</p>
            <p id="d5e416">On one level, the TEI encoding reinforces the claim by Lawlor, Frankel, and Bristow
               that Wilde diminishes the homoerotic elements by transforming Dorian from an erotic
               into an aesthetic object. This goal is achieved in three ways: first, by easing the
               tension surrounding his dialogue with Lord Henry; second, by emphasizing Dorian as
               an ideal subject for art; and finally, by removing the destructive connotations of
               Basil’s attachment to Dorian. On a deeper level, however, the existing textual
               scholarship has yet to contend with the complex ways in which Wilde’s
               intentionality is distributed among the revisions. To resolve some of the difficulty
               with encoding this text, one might employ more precise qualitative markers such as
               ‘tension’ in addition to ‘intimacy’, or ‘ardor’
               and ‘devotion’, in addition to ‘passion’, for example. But
               creating more tags would dilute the analytical utility of the TEI encoding, which
               is
               meant not meant to be exhaustive. In this project, the TEI reveals that the themes
               of intimacy, beauty, passion, and fatality operate in intransigent or inscrutable
               ways: at times they are plural, co-existing within a single line of text; more
               often, they are inextricable, with one enabling the other, like intimacy and passion
               which enable fatality; at other times, they enfold one within the other,
               encompassing a plurality of intentions. The TEI, which requires strict
               disambiguation, surfaces how these themes work together in ways that cannot be
               captured by its data structure.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="section"><a id="d5e417"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">Conclusion: Toward a Queer Form</h2>
            <p id="d5e419">As Heather Love points out, queerness will be ‘always bound up with loss’
               and the attempt to ‘rescue’ or ‘recover’ it will only lead
               to inevitable failure (<a href="#B17">2009: 51</a>). The TEI
               enables an approach toward editing in this text that complicates, rather than
               resolves, queerness. By encouraging encoders to impose a level of fixity on the
               text, the TEI allows them to discover exactly where queerness eludes containment.
               This computational constraint of the TEI is an <i>enabling</i> one: by
               surfacing moments of failed disambiguation, the TEI reinforces the encoder as the
               one who ascribes semantic value to Wilde’s revisions. This failed
               disambiguation is also productive: the practice of pinning something down only to
               realize that such intelligibility is impossible. The TEI has been productive
               precisely because it requires the encoder to construct labels for textual elements
               which, cannot be fully recovered. Accordingly, this practice in ‘queer
               encoding’ does not attempt to resolve the question of Wilde’s revisions
               but tags the homoerotic elements in such a way that allows them to retain some of
               their elusiveness. One may examine the formalizations produced by this TEI schema
               not for what it reveals about Wilde’s intentions, but for how it releases
               potential readings of the history of his composition, in other words, to mark and
               visualize its <i>queer form</i>: the elusive affects, repressed desires,
               and other coded elements of queerness within this text. The TEI confronts one with
               precisely that which escapes existing structures for knowing queerness, in order to
               suggest, without fully grasping, its ever-shifting permutations.</p>
