**** TODO Johnson, Jessica Marie. /Wicked Flesh/ 
Johnson takes something very constraining--marriage and baptism
records--and turns it into a mechanism for reading intimacy. 

Johnson examines existing structures for modes of resistance that
emerge from the logics of those structures. Johnson takes something
very constraining, that is, the social structures available to African
and African-descent women who lived during and sometimes operated
within the slave-trading 18th century. She studies civil records of
marriage and baptism for the ways they enable new productions of
intimacy, which is a practice of freedom.

Johnson’s project addresses the problem of data, which is the problem
of the archive in the Atlantic World. Her methodology is to close-read
the civil records to create a “promiscuous accounting of blackness not
as bondage and subjection, but as future possibility” (10). The
records, on their own, tell a story of bondage and subjection to
power. Johnson’s job is to construct a narrative around these records,
about the “ways black women sought out profane, pleasurable, and
erotic entanglements as practices of freedom” (12). In “Markup
Bodies,”another piece by this author, Johnson argues that data on its
own re-enacts the commodification of black bodies---that black bodies
are reduced to data points. In order to subvert the reduction of
bodies to “data,” data has to be supplemented with “black digital
practice,” which are the rich histories of black embodiment, the
narrative that surrounds the data, which accompanies the database.

How are the records themselves constituted and structured? Databases
themselves are far from neutral (as Johnson undoubtedly would
agree). They are constructed, structured data. I’m curious about the
formal aspects of this database, in the decisions made not only in
their creation but in their preservation. What if we think of these
records as their own data format, and examine the structures /
boundaries of that format?

Is there something within this structure that allows us to read an
emergent freedom?
**** Johnson, Jessie Marie. "Markup Bodies"
Questions "data" as neutral and stable, in slavery's archive. Rather,
data replicates death and commodification. Proposes a "black digital
practice" (Johnson "Markup Bodies" 58) to challenge the reproduction
of black death and commodofication.

Digital tools "mark up the bodies and requantify the lives of people
of african descent" (Johnson "Markup Bodies" 59). 

Digitizing is replicating. Commodifying. 

The Atlantic Slave Trade Database example: the database alone is
replicating traumas: "metrics in minutae niether lanced historical
trauma nor bridged the gap between the past itself and the search for
redress" (Johnson "Markup Bodies" 62).

"transmutation of black flesh into integers and fractions" (Johnson
"Markup Bodies" 65). 

This data is "corrupted" and needs to be reworked. 

Black digital practice as "screams in the archive" (Johnson "Markup
Bodies" 71). To feel pain, center the unquantifiable.

Queer of Color Critique is reactung against the collapsing of
difference in identity politics--queer theory was creating identities
for things in a way that incorporates/ignores intra-group
differences. Intersectionality disrupts the pluralism of
multiculturalism. 

"To the extent that queer studies understood sexuality to be singularly
constituted, the field betrayed its own investments in Eurocentric
presumptions of uniformity"

Building of Norma Alarcon, Kimberle Williams Crenshaw. Showing how
QOCC appears in Munoz.

"Queer of color critique began as a U.S.-based critical discourse
responding to the circumstances of migration, neoliberal state and
economic formations, and the developments of racial knowledges and
subjectivities about sexual and gender minorities within the United
States. As a convergence with and a departure from queer studies,
queer of color critique signaled the ways in which the dominant
literary, philosophical, and aesthetic engagements with queer
sexuality distanced themselves from the study of race and from
politico-economic concerns."

"As an effort designed to address connections between race, sexuality,
and political economy, queer of color critique had to begin by
confronting a founding limitation of queer studies, a limitation that
obscured the very connections that queer of color critique was
interested in exposing. That limitation had to do with an initial
ambivalence within queer studies about the connections that sexuality
has to other modes of difference....This presumed equivalence and
authenticity imply a liberal pluralism aimed at including racial and
gender subjects into existing normative institutions and systems."

"Consider, for instance, Norma Alarcón’s critique of the identity
politics of Anglo-American feminism in her 1990 essay “The Theoretical
Subjects of This Bridge Called My Back.” In that essay Alarcón
considers the epistemological impact of women of color feminism, in
general, and the 1981 anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings
by Radical Women of Color. For Alarcón, the overall work of women of
color feminists and the volume are significant not because they
offered a “rainbow theory” or a discourse of authenticity. They were
significant because they called into question the implicit subject of
Anglo-American feminism. As Alarcón put it, “[The] most popular
subject of Anglo-American feminism is an autonomous, self-making,
self-determining subject who first proceeds according to the logic of
identification with regard to the subject of consciousness, a notion
usually viewed as the purview of man, but now claimed for women.”"

"For Alarcón, This Bridge and women of color feminism analyzed the
ways in which patriarchal and liberal notions of agency account for
the ideological structure of Anglo-American feminism. In doing so,
Alarcón produces a devastating critique of how Anglo-American feminism
attempted to base feminist authenticity on a replication rather than a
repudiation of heteropatriarchal agency."

"Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw’s classic article “Mapping the Margins:
Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of
Color” provided another example of how intersectional work was a
critique of authenticity politics. For instance, in her discussion of
identity politics, she argued, “The problem with identity politics is
not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge,
but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores
intra-group differences.”11 Crenshaw offered intersectionality as a
critique of the ways in which race and gender were politicized as
consistent with ideologies of discreteness and authenticity. As she
stated, “Feminist efforts to politicize experiences of women and
antiracist efforts to politicize people of color have frequently
proceeded as though the issues and experiences they each detail occur
in mutually exclusive terrains.”12 In designating race and gender as
categories that are constituted in relation to each other as well as
other social differences, Crenshaw presented intersectionality as a
means for disrupting discourses of authenticity and providing
alternatives to those discourses."

"Instead of arguing for the authenticity of categories of race and
gender, women of color feminism and its intersectional strategies can
be productively interpreted as attempts to show the limits of
authenticity discourses and the ways that those discourses
marginalized women of color. Contrary to the notion that modes of
difference can be understood singularly, women of color feminists
advanced arguments that posited those modes as necessarily constituted
in relation to one another, for historical and political reasons."

"Muñoz defines the hermeneutical properties of disidentification by
arguing, “For the critic, disidentification is the hermeneutical
performance of decoding mass, high, or any other cultural field from
the perspective of a minority subject who is disempowered in such a
representational hierarchy.”

**** TODO Roderick A. Ferguson’s Aberration in Black: Toward a Queer of Critique
"The book attempted to demonstrate the ways in which the discipline’s
liberal regard for African Americans was precisely the mechanism for
constructing African American culture as outside of the normative
boundaries of the archetypal Western subject and the citizen-subject
of the United States."

Drawing from Textual Scholarship (Jerome McGann and Ken Price) to
apply to the way we think about race.  Following McGann in "Imagining
what we don't know", she says "you must build the archive to learn
what you need to know" (Earhart 40). What she has is not an archive, a
repository, but a "search-and-display space for materials located on
disparate servers" (40-41).

Increased access to technology has not increased representation of
marginalized subjects or texts. How to create inclusive structures for
digitization projects. Earhart emphasizes accomodation of
technological standards (like the TEI) and institutional affiliation
(like DH centers and funding) to projects that are DIY. She also
emphasizes "theoretical work to do in teh selection, editing, and
technological manipulation of our materials" (316).

What we need is messiness:
- Cites Martha Nell Smith about DH practitioners fleeing cultural
criticism, sheltering in the objectivity of the computer.
- Earhart says that we have a structural problem, more than a problem
of selection, in DH (314). 

Begins by discussing the digital canon. Early excitement
(technodeterminism) about access to material has not borne out the
dissolution of hegemonic high (white) culture.

DH as a field is slow to incorporate cultural criticism, ala Alan
Liu (310).

IN order for projects to actually succeed, they need affiliation and
funding, as well as rigorous technical standards. For example, /NINES/
with the TEI. (315).

* outline
** intro / question
How do editorial practices with TEI engage queerness? How might they
approach queerness and schematization?
- The answer has to do with examining TEI structure for the way it
  perpetuates certain assumptions.
- But not only to examine this structure, but also to offer methods
  for subverting it.

Tinseley's call to the material. 
** textual scholarship & queer historiography
The question of historical queerness mirrors that of editorial intent
- how can we know the truth of it? The answer is that we cannot know
  the truth of it, and the attempt to know the truth is actually
  imposing. What we can do is to guess, make forms which are
  interpretively rich (deformance)
- But this position is inherently color-blind. As if form can be
  separted from politics. 

** QOCC intervention in Queer Studies

Slavery's archive -- Jessica Marie Johnston's way of thinking about
data replicating past traumas/oppressions; in order to get more from
the data, we need qualitative expansion, "black digital practice".

** the TEI schema
TEI is about adding descriptive information to text. It's about a kind
of qualitative markup. This should give the standard some room to
accomodate complexity. But the governing structure is a nesting
structure. That means that elements are necessarily contained within a
hierarchy. One root element encapsulates them all, and variation is
only possible by means of extension from the root. 

- What if we created a TEI schema that attends to whiteness as a
  structuring power? That explores the role of constraint, bounding,
  in TEI.
    - TEI schema with additional tags, such as "privilege," or
      "colonialism", for example. 
    - Maybe "disidentification". Some kind of schema that points to
      the undercurrent of whiteness propping up the text.
- Perhaps that examines how constraint in TEI as a data structure
  evokes constraints of whiteness.

"conceptual", "declarative", "logical", "structural", and "semantic"
markup. 

**** Dominance is totalizing, or bureaucratic
Hierarchical conflicts in text documents often have to do with a
contradiction between the physical structure of a document (page or
line of text, for example) and the semantic structure (sentence,
chapter, for example. These issues often occur in poetry, where the
conflict (and it is a lovely conflict) between metrical and sytactic
structures, such as the use of enjambment to continue a sentence
beyond the end of a line. 

XML researcher and creator of LMNL Jeni Tennison explores how markup
might prioritize containment as well as suggest dominance
relationships between elements. She distinguishes between containment
and dominance:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
When you’re talking about overlapping structures, it’s useful to make
the distinction between structures that /contain/ each other and
structures that /dominate/ each other. Containment is a happenstance
relationship between ranges while dominance is one that has a
meaningful semantic. A page may happen to contain a stanza, but a poem
domainates the stanzas that it contains. Tennison, "Overlap,
Containment, and Dominance"; emphasis original
#+END_QUOTE
One is more power-neutral, the other implies power
relationships. Tennison, who "want[s] to see if we can get away with
not having hierarchy as a fundamental part of the information model,"
hinks about XML schemas based on containment rather than dominance,
where the tags mark ranges describing start and stop points rather
than elements which are nested (Tennison, "Essential Hierarhcy"). The
problem is that dominance is at time necessary. For example,
"Analysing the way in which the syntactic (sentence/phrase) structure
overlaps with the prosodic (stanza/line) structure is one important
way in which you can analyse a poem" (Tennison, "Overlap, Containment,
and Dominance"). She points out that there is no easy solution for
including dominance into data structures. You either have to place
/everything/ within a tree structure, use milestones (like TEI does,
severing elements, effectively), or develop a special syntax to
indicate dominance (which models like GODDAG and LMNL. Dominance
structures, in other words, are either totalizing, or they are
excessively bureaucratic.

TEI guidelines, module 16 on "Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment,"
describes various methods for encoding information that is not
hierarchic or linear, which are based on the W3C XPointer framework
and generally use the ~@xml:id~ attribute, pointers, blocks, segments,
anchors, correspondence, alignment, synchronization, aggregation,
alternation, sequesteration, marginalization, among others. Module 20,
"Non-hierarchical Structures" 

** queer editorial projects

** conclusion: the future of editing

* draft
** intro
This paper considers the potential alignment between a rigidly
structured and constraining editorial format, the TEI, and a
strategically nebulous amalgam of identities and politics expressed by
the designation of queerness. It considers how textual editing
practices with the TEI might reflect or engage with queerness as
theorized by Queer Studies. It then proposes a possible future for
developing editorial methodologies with TEI to mark up non-normative
identities and sexualities in text.

This project begins with a self-reflection on my training in Textual
Scholarship, and past work that interweaves critical conversations in
Textual Scholarship with those from the field of Queer
Historiography. I then point out how my involvement in the work of
analyzing queerness work led me to overlook the imbrication of
queerness with race. In my attention to queer possibilites for
resistance, I failed to notice the ways in which institutional
whiteness operates as an unmarked but structuring force in both
textual editing practices and Queer Studies. To correct that
oversight, I examine the rise of Queer of Color's /Critique/ on Queer
Studies, and how the work on the archive of slavery offers models for
recognizing the structuring modes of knowledge innate to recovery and
preservation practices, not to mention data formats. I then turn to
the TEI schema, to interrogate how its hierarchical and bounded
structure might be problematized or re-worked to engage some of the
more invisible forces that determine meaning-making, offering some
examples of this work in contemporary editorial projects. 
- Digital workflows for collaboration. 
- using nonexperts (students) bc of lack of funding

** textual scholarship and queer historiography
First, I begin with my own trajectory of thought on the subject. My thinking about editorial work has always taken as a basic premise
Jerome McGann's assertion, from the dawn of of electronic editing,
that our digital tools, working as a "prosthetic extension of that
demand for critical reflection," ought to materialize latent aspects
of the text (McGann 2001, 18).

Productive vs Restorative

So imagine my delight when I found something similar happening in
Queer Theory, in debates about Queer Historiography.
