Johnson takes something very constraining--marriage and baptism
records--and turns it into a mechanism for reading intimacy. 

Johnson examines existing structures for modes of resistance that
emerge from the logics of those structures. Johnson takes something
very constraining, that is, the social structures available to African
and African-descent women who lived during and sometimes operated
within the slave-trading 18th century. She studies civil records of
marriage and baptism for the ways they enable new productions of
intimacy, which is a practice of freedom.

Johnson’s project addresses the problem of data, which is the problem
of the archive in the Atlantic World. Her methodology is to close-read
the civil records to create a “promiscuous accounting of blackness not
as bondage and subjection, but as future possibility” (10). The
records, on their own, tell a story of bondage and subjection to
power. Johnson’s job is to construct a narrative around these records,
about the “ways black women sought out profane, pleasurable, and
erotic entanglements as practices of freedom” (12). In “Markup
Bodies,”another piece by this author, Johnson argues that data on its
own re-enacts the commodification of black bodies---that black bodies
are reduced to data points. In order to subvert the reduction of
bodies to “data,” data has to be supplemented with “black digital
practice,” which are the rich histories of black embodiment, the
narrative that surrounds the data, which accompanies the database.

How are the records themselves constituted and structured? Databases
themselves are far from neutral (as Johnson undoubtedly would
agree). They are constructed, structured data. I’m curious about the
formal aspects of this database, in the decisions made not only in
their creation but in their preservation. What if we think of these
records as their own data format, and examine the structures /
boundaries of that format?

Is there something within this structure that allows us to read an
emergent freedom?
**** Johnson, Jessie Marie. "Markup Bodies"
Questions "data" as neutral and stable, in slavery's archive. Rather,
data replicates death and commodification. Proposes a "black digital
practice" (Johnson "Markup Bodies" 58) to challenge the reproduction
of black death and commodofication.

Digital tools "mark up the bodies and requantify the lives of people
of african descent" (Johnson "Markup Bodies" 59). 

Digitizing is replicating. Commodifying. 

The Atlantic Slave Trade Database example: the database alone is
replicating traumas: "metrics in minutae niether lanced historical
trauma nor bridged the gap between the past itself and the search for
redress" (Johnson "Markup Bodies" 62).

"transmutation of black flesh into integers and fractions" (Johnson
"Markup Bodies" 65). 

This data is "corrupted" and needs to be reworked. 

Black digital practice as "screams in the archive" (Johnson "Markup
Bodies" 71). To feel pain, center the unquantifiable.

Queer of Color Critique is reactung against the collapsing of
difference in identity politics--queer theory was creating identities
for things in a way that incorporates/ignores intra-group
differences. Intersectionality disrupts the pluralism of
multiculturalism. 

"To the extent that queer studies understood sexuality to be singularly
constituted, the field betrayed its own investments in Eurocentric
presumptions of uniformity"

Building of Norma Alarcon, Kimberle Williams Crenshaw. Showing how
QOCC appears in Munoz.

"Queer of color critique began as a U.S.-based critical discourse
responding to the circumstances of migration, neoliberal state and
economic formations, and the developments of racial knowledges and
subjectivities about sexual and gender minorities within the United
States. As a convergence with and a departure from queer studies,
queer of color critique signaled the ways in which the dominant
literary, philosophical, and aesthetic engagements with queer
sexuality distanced themselves from the study of race and from
politico-economic concerns."

"As an effort designed to address connections between race, sexuality,
and political economy, queer of color critique had to begin by
confronting a founding limitation of queer studies, a limitation that
obscured the very connections that queer of color critique was
interested in exposing. That limitation had to do with an initial
ambivalence within queer studies about the connections that sexuality
has to other modes of difference....This presumed equivalence and
authenticity imply a liberal pluralism aimed at including racial and
gender subjects into existing normative institutions and systems."

"Consider, for instance, Norma Alarcón’s critique of the identity
politics of Anglo-American feminism in her 1990 essay “The Theoretical
Subjects of This Bridge Called My Back.” In that essay Alarcón
considers the epistemological impact of women of color feminism, in
general, and the 1981 anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings
by Radical Women of Color. For Alarcón, the overall work of women of
color feminists and the volume are significant not because they
offered a “rainbow theory” or a discourse of authenticity. They were
significant because they called into question the implicit subject of
Anglo-American feminism. As Alarcón put it, “[The] most popular
subject of Anglo-American feminism is an autonomous, self-making,
self-determining subject who first proceeds according to the logic of
identification with regard to the subject of consciousness, a notion
usually viewed as the purview of man, but now claimed for women.”"

"For Alarcón, This Bridge and women of color feminism analyzed the
ways in which patriarchal and liberal notions of agency account for
the ideological structure of Anglo-American feminism. In doing so,
Alarcón produces a devastating critique of how Anglo-American feminism
attempted to base feminist authenticity on a replication rather than a
repudiation of heteropatriarchal agency."

"Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw’s classic article “Mapping the Margins:
Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of
Color” provided another example of how intersectional work was a
critique of authenticity politics. For instance, in her discussion of
identity politics, she argued, “The problem with identity politics is
not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge,
but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores
intra-group differences.”11 Crenshaw offered intersectionality as a
critique of the ways in which race and gender were politicized as
consistent with ideologies of discreteness and authenticity. As she
stated, “Feminist efforts to politicize experiences of women and
antiracist efforts to politicize people of color have frequently
proceeded as though the issues and experiences they each detail occur
in mutually exclusive terrains.”12 In designating race and gender as
categories that are constituted in relation to each other as well as
other social differences, Crenshaw presented intersectionality as a
means for disrupting discourses of authenticity and providing
alternatives to those discourses."

"Instead of arguing for the authenticity of categories of race and
gender, women of color feminism and its intersectional strategies can
be productively interpreted as attempts to show the limits of
authenticity discourses and the ways that those discourses
marginalized women of color. Contrary to the notion that modes of
difference can be understood singularly, women of color feminists
advanced arguments that posited those modes as necessarily constituted
in relation to one another, for historical and political reasons."

"Muñoz defines the hermeneutical properties of disidentification by
arguing, “For the critic, disidentification is the hermeneutical
performance of decoding mass, high, or any other cultural field from
the perspective of a minority subject who is disempowered in such a
representational hierarchy.”

"The book attempted to demonstrate the ways in which the discipline’s
liberal regard for African Americans was precisely the mechanism for
constructing African American culture as outside of the normative
boundaries of the archetypal Western subject and the citizen-subject
of the United States."

digitization projects. Earhart emphasizes accomodation of
technological standards (like the TEI) and institutional affiliation
(like DH centers and funding) to projects that are DIY. She also
emphasizes "theoretical work to do in teh selection, editing, and
technological manipulation of our materials" (316).

What we need is messiness:
- Cites Martha Nell Smith about DH practitioners fleeing cultural
criticism, sheltering in the objectivity of the computer.
- Earhart says that we have a structural problem, more than a problem
of selection, in DH (314).

* draft
** intro
This paper considers the potential alignment between a rigidly
structured and constraining editorial format, the TEI, and a
strategically nebulous collection of identities and politics expressed
by the designation of queer. It proposes how textual editing practices
with the TEI might engage modes of resistance against dominance
structures as theorized by Queer of Color Critique. It illustrates how
this field of study, which critiques Queer Studies’ capitulation to
majoritarian and neoliberal politics, offers models for reworking the
structuring forces within both the TEI markup language and textual
editing practices more broadly.

This project begins with a self-reflection on my work developing a
custom schema to mark up the homoerotic content that Oscar Wilde
edited out of his novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). I point
out how, in my focus on creating a new schema to mark up the text's
queer content, I overlook the mutually reinforcing nature of dominance
structures across data formats and text encoding practices. Correcting
that oversight, this paper draws from Queer of Color's /Critique/ on
Queer Studies to energize a radical re-thinking of electronic data
formats. Here, I draw from Black Feminist theorizing about the archive
and slavery and their resistance against the invisible forces that
determine historical inquiry and meaning-making. I close by
highlighting examples of current projects that deploy collaborative
and minimalist practices to challenge the structuring modes of textual
editing and the TEI.

** textual scholarship and queer historiography
I begin with my own trajectory of thinking on the subject. Early in
graduate school, I took a course on Textual Scholarship that seemed to
ground the heady atmosphere of seminar discussion in the comforting,
physical fact of the text--something that takes up space in the world,
that I could literally touch. I then discovered that textual editing
methodologies like the TEI, which rooted intellectual work in the
minute labor of transcription and markup, brought me to think deeply
and critically about formal aspects of text. It was at that time that
I was introduced to Jerome McGann's /Radiant Textuality: Litery
Studies After The Worldwide Web/ (2001), and his position that digital
tools in literary scholarship ought to work as "prosthetic
extension[s] of that demand for critical reflection" (McGann 2001,
18). McGann's ideas solidifed something essentially creative about the
critial process, which helped me to form my early conviction that
literary analysis ought to build from considerations of textual form.

I begin with my own trajectory of thinking on textual editing
practices. Early in graduate school, I took a course on Textual
Scholarship that grounded the heady atmosphere typical to seminar
course discussions in the physical fact of the text–something that
takes up space, which I could literally touch. I found that textual
editing methodologies like the TEI, by rooting intellectual work in
the minute labor of transcription and markup, encourages deep and
critical thinking about formal aspects of text. It was at that time
that I was introduced to Jerome McGann's position that digital tools
for literary scholarship ought to work as "prosthetic extension[s] of
that demand for critical reflection" (McGann 2001, 18). McGann's ideas
helped to solidify my early conviction that critical analysis could
build from hands-on exploration of textual form.

With this in mind, I pursued genetic editing projects that would allow
me to a text’s revision history. Here, I turned to Oscar Wilde's
manuscript of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), a holograph draft
that he revised heavily before sending it for publication in
/Lippincott's Monthly Magazine/ on June 20, 1890 (Calado 2022).[fn:1]
I focused on Wilde’s revisions—his suppressions—of homoerotic tensions
and suggestions between the story's three main characters, Basil
Hallward, Lord Henry Wotten, and the eponymous Dorian Gray. I marked
up these revisions with custom, semantic tags offering four potential
values: “intimacy,” “beauty,” “passion,” and “fatality.”  These tags
indicate general patterns like the stifling of emotional tension,
physical affection, expressions of beauty and passion, and of the
obsessive and self-destructive effects of infatuation. In addition to
marking up conceptual changes to the manuscript, I also noted physical
elements, like the number of Wilde's pen strokes over each span of
deleted text.

I draw my encoding principles for this project from across the
disparate fields of Textual Scholarship and Queer Historiography who,
I argue, are having a similar debate about the historian's impulse
toward recovery. Until the popularization of the digital editing
methods in the 90s and early 2000s, Textual Scholarship tends to
privilege the editor as a recoverer or preserver of text, with
prominent editors like Ronald B. McKerrow promoting authorial
intention as the dominant criterion for editorial decisions. [fn:2]
Toward the end of the 20th century, this prioritization of authorial
intention, which I call the “restorative approach,” begins to shift in
the wake of new tools that multiply, rather than narrow, the potential
forms that editorial work might take. Here, the work of Jerome McGann,
drawing from Donald F. McKenzie's “sociology of text,” which
challenges the idea a single text could ever represent an "ideal"
version, explores how electronic environments open a space for
representing textual variation unhindered by the limitations of the
codex format. Opposed to the restorative aims of their predecessors,
McKenzie and McGann's approach, which I call the “productive”
approach, subscribes the text to new formal configurations that can
stimulate analysis. To this debate in Textual Scholarship, I connect
what I perceive to be an analogous debate within the field of Queer
Historiography, which concerns the applicability of “queer” as a
designation for identifying historical subjects. The “productive” side
of debate argues that queerness in the past cannot be scrutinized in
the present without subscribing it to a teleology that effectively
normalizes its essential alterity. Heather Love, for example, proposes
a critical method that, rather than attempt to pin down queerness,
attends to the ways that it eludes knowability. By contrast, the
“restorative” side maintains that queerness requires historical
specificity in order to be legible, and that it ought to be traced as
a historically situated phenomenon.[fn:3]

Guided by this framework of queerness as strategically uncontainable,
I set out to mark up information that I suspected would provoke the
bounds of the tags themselves. My encoding work unearths, as I had
expected it to, a resistance to the demand for fixity in the TEI
schema. The boundedness of the TEI format, which encapsulates data
within a structured set of tags, struggles against the porous
perimeters of these queer themes in the text. My custom schema engaged
the difficulty of this conceptual information with the physical
register of Wilde's pen strokes across the pages, which sometimes
fails to map with the themes. While some of the editorial decisions
are straightforward, for example, that of “intimacy,” like when Basil
“tak[es] hold of [Lord Henry's] hand” (Wilde 9), or when Dorian's
“cheek just brushed [Basil's] cheek” (Wilde 20), others are more
difficult. Sometimes, the revisions of intimacy have the attendant
effect of mitigating the sense of fatality that surrounds Basil's
attraction to Dorian. In one striking moment from the dialogue, for
example, Basil struggles to impart to Lord Henry the effect of his
passion for Dorian Gray. The original line in the manuscript reads:
“Lord Henry hesitated for a moment. ‘And what is that?' he asked, in a
low voice. ‘I will tell you,’ said Hallward, and a look of pain came
over his face. ‘Don't if you would rather not,’ murmured his
companion, looking at him" (9). In the revised version, Lord Henry
“laugh[s]” rather than “hesistate[s],” he no longer speaks “in a low
voice,” and his “look of pain” is neutralized into “an expression of
perplexity.” These changes, which lighten a particularly tense display
of “intimacy,” also work to obscure Basil's internal suffering,
fitting within the category “fatality.” Marking up the number of pen
strokes reinforces the TEI’s structural constraints: while the word
“look” is struck too heavily to be counted, the word “pain” contains a
single stroke. It is impossible to mark the number of strokes for each
word without separating this single revision into two instances.

** the TEI structure
This formal experiment, however "productive" in its refusal against
the restorative impulse, now seems insufficient. The more that I work
with the TEI, the more I come to realize that the problem with its
data model goes beyond the boundedness of its elements, and toward a
dominating, top-down structure that it imposes on textual “data.” At
the root of the TEI's rigidity is its hierarchical document model that
propagates implicit power relations between elements in the document,
where each element within the tree structure subscribes to its parent
element and dominates its subordinate ones. Within this tree-like
architecture, information is not only encapsulated or bound, it is
delineated by the standards of each governing tag, its syntax, model,
attributes, and contents.

Within this data model, there is no easy solution for resisting
dominance. Two examples, 15 years apart, serve to illustrate attempts
to do so by researchers and scholars within the TEI community. The
first occurs in 2008, when XML researcher Jeni Tennison writes about
developing a new markup language that distinguishes dominance from
containment. Tennison, who “want[s] to see if we can get away with not
having hierarchy as a fundamental part of the information model,”
explains that element overlap is essential for some forms of written
language (Tennison 2008, "Essential Hierarchy"). For example, “the way
in which the syntactic (sentence/phrase) structure overlaps with the
prosodic (stanza/line) structure is one important way in which you can
analyse a poem” (Tennison 2008, "Overlap, Containment, and
Dominance"). Within a hierarchical data model, conflicts arise from
the clashing of different encoding priorities across the structural
and semantic readings of the document, where the layers of structure,
meter, grammar, and semantics can propagate contentious claims on a
single word or line of text. To resolve these conflicts, one might
distinguish between dominance and containment. As Tennison explains,
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
When you’re talking about overlapping structures, it’s useful to make
the distinction between structures that /contain/ each other and
structures that /dominate/ each other. Containment is a happenstance
relationship between ranges while dominance is one that has a
meaningful semantic. A page may happen to contain a stanza, but a poem
domainates the stanzas that it contains. Tennison 2008, "Overlap,
Containment, and Dominance"; emphasis original
#+END_QUOTE
As a solution that prioritizes containment while also suggesting
dominance relationships, Tennison proposes a new (but now unsupported)
markup language: "The Layered Markup and Annotation Language"
(LMNL). It uses a series of ranges that describe start and stop points
for an element, rather than nesting elements one inside the other. In
the example below, the tags are left open to accommodate additional
ranges:
#+BEGIN_SOURCE

the document object model is considerably less readable than the TEI.

The problem with TEI, and more deeply, with its parent structure, XML,
is that dominance structures are totalizing. Attempts to curtail this
dominance, as LMNL demonstrates, can result in redundancy and
convolution. The TEI Guideline’s suggestions for handling dominance
appear similarly complicated, especially in comparison to more
traditional TEI markup. Module 16, on "Linking, Segmentation, and
Alignment," describes various methods for encoding information that is
not hierarchic or linear, including the use of pointers, blocks,
segments, anchors, correspondence, alignment, synchronization,
aggregation, alternation, sequestration, marginalization, among
others. In Module 20, “Non-hierarchical Structures,” more suggestions
include: “redundant encoding of information in multiple forms," and
"the use of empty elements to delimit the boundaries of a non-nesting
structure.” These solutions work by severing elements into components
that maintain their own internal hierarchies which can be later
recombined into the dominant hierarchy. When the totalizing nature of
the TEI is diluted, the effect is to create a bureaucratization that
disrupts its sense of unity.

The issue of hierarchical dominance structures emerges again at the
most recent annual TEI Conference and Members Meeting in 2022, where
Elisa Beshero-Bondar and her team reflect on their work developing a
~<gender>~ element for the TEI guidelines. Their project proposes a
new ~<gender>~ element that is careful to weigh the expressive
potential for representing gender against the possible risks of
reifying normative cultural biases. As other projects seeking to
encode plural or multiple gender ontologies have explained,[fn:4]
gender identities may take manifold forms, some of which can be
contained within a capacious enough set of tags and attributes, such
as distinct ~<gender>~ and ~<sex>~ tags. Other gender identities,
however, may not fit into distinct categories. In the latter case, the
problem goes deeper than the name of the tag itself and runs up
against the hierarchical structure of the TEI document
model. Beshero-Bondar and her colleagues explain that,
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Unexpectedly, we found ourselves confronting the Guidelines’
prioritization of personhood in discussion of sex, likely stemming
from the conflation of sex and gender in the current version of the
Guidelines. In revising the technical specifications describing sex,
we introduced the term “organism” to broaden the application of sex
encoding. We leave it to our community to investigate the fluid
concepts of gender and sex in their textual manifestations of
personhood and biological life. Beshero-Bondar et al.
#+END_QUOTE
While their new proposed element, ~<gender>~, gives the team some
capacity to represent gender as distinct from sex, the tagging
structure nonetheless perpetuates a rule that "sex" serves some
concept of personhood. The proposed solutions to this problem, which
include exchanging <person> for the more capacious ~<organism>~ and
~<entity>~, as recently proposed in the TEI documentation itself,
keeps intact the notion that "sex" is something a person contains,
that is, sex as something belonging to or expressed by a notion of
personhood (martindholmes 2022).

** Queer of Color Critique
I now turn to Queer of Color Critique to explore models for working
within and against systems of dominance. As Roderick A. Ferguson, who
coined the field's name, affirms, “Queer of Color Critique decodes
culture fields not from a position outside those fields, but from
within them, as those fields account for the queer of color subject’s
historicity” (Ferguson 2004, 4). The critique of this field responds
to dominating trends within Queer Studies itself, whose centering of
universal whiteness becomes more and more apparent in the wake of
increasing mainstream acceptance. Resisting incorporation into
heteronormative and neoliberal politics, Queer of Color Critique
foregrounds the imbrication of sexuality and race. One prominent
critic, José Esteban Muñoz, frames this intersectional approach as a
rebuke of the “antirelational turn” in Queer Studies, perhaps
exemplified most famously by Lee Edelman's No Future: Queer Theory and
the Death Drive, and the field of Queer Negativity which it
spawned. According to Muñoz, the antirelational frame of thinking
exhibits a willful blindness toward difference, particularly toward
racial difference:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[M]ost of the work with which I disagree under the provisional title
of "antirelational thesis" moves to imagine an escape of denouncement
of relationality as first and foremost a distancing of queernes from
what some theorists seem to think of as the contamination of race,
gender, or other particularities that taint the purity of sexuality as
the singular trope of difference. In other words, antirelational
approaches to queer theory are romances of the negative, wishful
thinking, and investments in deferring various dreams of
difference. Muñoz 2009, 11
#+END_QUOTE
Drawing racial and gender minority positions into conversation with
sexuality, Muñoz argues, enables new forms of politically-potent
collectivism. For example, Muñoz poses queerness as a future-bound
phenomenon to energizes an intersectional politics that can resist
conscription into majoritarian systems. He asserts that, “Queerness is
not yet here. Queerness is an ideality… We may never touch queerness,
but we can feel it in the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with
potentiality” (1). Framing queerness as utopia enables two critical
moves. The first is to glimpse queerness as a guiding structure that
“renders potential blueprints of a world not quite here, a horizon of
possibility, not a fixed schema” (Muñoz 2009, 97). The second is to
foreclose attempts of incorporation into the mainstream, “staving off
the ossifying effects of neoliberal ideology and the degredation of
politics brought about by representations of queerness in popular
culture” (Muñoz 2019, 22). By virtue of being “not yet here,” in other
words, queer futurity can structure modes of resistance within systems
of dominance.

The strategy of centering minority subject positions within
majoritarian dominance structures drives much of critical work on
arguably one of the most precarious datasets in history—the archive of
slavery. As Saidiya Hartman explains, this archive is constituted by
recording practices that not only omit or obscure information,
archive, but also employ a language that cannot approximate experience
within a discourse that dictates silence (Hartman 2008, 2). Jessica
Marie Johnson takes up this archive, a collection of documents written
by slave-owning men, traders, and colonial officials. These sources
“often contain incomplete information” which she must “bring together
in careful and creative ways” (Johnson 2020, 5). Her readings of these
documents, which include marriage and baptism records from the 17th
century, for example, weave a complicated and nuanced picture of black
womens’ negotiation of their own freedom practices within the
circumscribed systems of the early Atlantic world. Here, Johnson
resists the rigid constraints that bound her inquiry in two ways. The
first way is by a strategy of narration, where Johnson pieces together
fragments that, on their own, tell a story of bondage and subjection
to power. Rather than reify this dominating narrative, Johnson relates
the “ways black women sought out profane, pleasurable, and erotic
entanglements as practices of freedom” (Johnson 2020, 12). For
example, she frames each chapter with the story of different woman
from the archive, constructing for the reader a vivid scene that
foregrounds the woman’s character and accomplishments. One chapter
begins with a dinner party by Seignora Catti, “a wealthy merchant in
her own right,” who “had leveraged her status as the wife of a
European against her commercial savvy… for her own benefit" (Johnson
16). The notes reveal that the sources for Catti's biography stem from
biographical writings featuring Jean Barbot, a commercial agent for a
French slaving company based in Senegal. In Johnson's narrative,
Barbot functions as a supporting character, a guest at Catti's dinner
party who serves to distinguish her graciousness and work as a
host. Johnson's method of bringing Catti into the foreground requires
more than just assembling fragments from Barbot's biographies; it
requires narrating from what Johnson describes at the end of her book
as "a deeper well of women, communities, practices, strategies,
failures, and terrors that shaped the meaning of freedom and a faith
in the possibility of emancipation" (Johnson 2020, 231). These
histories, which will never be known, influence stories like the one
of Seignora Catti, "the part we are able to witness" (Johnson 2020,
231).

Nearly two decades after its emergence, Queer of Color Critique
influences a number of cultural studies methods that foreground race,
including Black Feminist Studies. Scholars in this field often work
with one of the most precarious datasets in history--that of slavery's
archive, which contains "archival violence" not only in the form of
records that literally obscure information, but also in the language
that cannot approximate experience, and in the discourse that dictates
silence (Hartman 2008, 2). In her book, /Wicked Flesh: Black Women,
Intimacy, and Freedom in the Atlantic World/, Johnson takes up a
collection of documents written by slave-owning men, traders, and
colonial officials to read narratives of resistance in black womens'
lives. Her sources consist of official documents, marriage and baptism
records from the 17th century, for example, that "often contain
incomplete information" which she "bring[s] together in careful and
creative ways" (Johnson 2020, 5). Her readings of these documents
weave a complicated and nuanced picture of black womens's lives and
how they negotiated their own freedom practices within the
circumscribed system of white, male, slave-owning dominance in early
Atlantic world. Here, Johnson demonstrates two critical methods that
resist the rigid constraints that bound her inquiry. The first is a
strategy of narration, where Johnson interweaves fragments that, on
their own, tell a story of bondage and subjection to power. Rather
than reify this dominating narrative, Johnson relates the “ways black
women sought out profane, pleasurable, and erotic entanglements as
practices of freedom” (Johnson 2020, 12). She frames each chapter with
the story of different figure from the archive, constructing for the
reader a vivid scene from the woman's life in a way that foregrounds
her character and accomplishment. For example, a dinner party by
Seignora Catti, "a wealthy merchant in her own right, had leveraged
her status as the wife of a European against her commercial savvy and
the opportunities and experience of living in the middle ground
between the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Wolof sovereigns in the
east for her own benefit" (Johnson 16). The notes reveal that the
sources for Catti's biography stem from biographical writings
featuring Jean Barbot, a commercial agent for a French slaving company
based in Senegal. In Johnson's narrative, Barbot functions as a
supporting character, a guest at Catti's dinner party who serves to
distinguish her graciousness and work as a host. Johnson's method of
bringing Catti into the foreground requires more than just assembling
fragments from Barbot's biographies; it requires narrating from what
Johnson describes at the end of her book as "a deeper well of women,
communities, practices, strategies, failures, and terrors that shaped
the meaning of freedom and a faith in the possibility of emancipation"
(Johnson 2020, 231). These histories, which will never be known,
influence stories like the one of Seignora Catti, "the part we are
able to witness" (Johnson 2020, 231).

In addition to reading between the fragments in the record, Johnson
resignifies its silences. Drawing from Hortense Spillers's theorizing
on the effects of slavery on gender, Johnson's project “rejects
discourses of black women as lascivious or wicked, and transmut[e]
them into practices of defiance and pleasure for themselves” (Johnson
2020, 10). This work emerges most provocatively in the way that
Johnson handles information that is missing from the archive, for
example, a census that ignores the presence of black women and girls
living in the New Orleans area in the early 18th century. Reading
these absences as “null values,”[fn:5] rather than absent values or zero
values, Johnson reframes the absence of information to “resis[t]
equating the missing or inapplicable information with black death”
(Johnson 2020, 135). Asserting these null values allows Johnson to
index where these women exceed the logics of colonial
subjectification:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is possible to see their absence as evidence of either their
perceived nonexistence or lack of importance, or inferior
data-collection practices. It is also possible, however, to hear in
the register's silence the ecstatic shout of black freedom practices
transgressing colonial desires, black people forming maps of kin
between towns and countryside, black women loving each other into free
states that could not be counted by census officials, much less
managed by imperial entities or recorded on manuscript pages. Johnson
2020, 143
#+END_QUOTE
The histories of what could have been, which do not fit into dominant
systems of quantification, include the radical seeking of “joy and
pleasure, g[iving] birth, mother[ing] spaces of care and celebration,
and cultivat[ing] expressive and embodied aesthetic practices to heal
from the everyday toil of their laboring lives” (Johnson 10). By
virtue of not being counted, Johnson argues, these women show “where
they exceed the bounds of colonial power” based on the quantification
and commodification of black life. These null values allow Johnson to
frame "blackness not as bondage… but as future possibility" (Johnson
2020, 10).

** The future of editing
By way of conclusion, I will highlight two recent TEI projects that,
like Johnson's work on slavery's archive, resist rigid structures of
dominance. As Amy Earhart points out, editorial practices are bound by
structures deeper than the TEI data format. The obstacles that prevent
many text encoding projects from succeeding have to do with the
absence of strong institutional support and funding. Therefore, in what
follows, I look at how two projects take what Earhart describes as a
“DIY approach” that defies the structural constraints of both the
institution and the data format (Earhart 2010, 314).

The first project, the /Editing the Eartha M.M. White Collection/,
based at the University of Florida, is an electronic archive of
personal correspondence and other documents related to Eartha
M.M. White (1876–1974), the founder of the Clara White Mission and a
leader of Jacksonville, Florida's African American
community. Beginning in a classroom in 2016, this project continues to
grow through the collaborative effort of students, faculty, staff at
UNF, with recent efforts being made to expand into the Jacksonville
community more broadly. To facilitate collaboration on the project,
they share their TEI documents on GitHub, an online space for
publishing digital work (used primarily for collaborating on open
software), and offer detailed, step-by-step instructions for new
editors to get started with text encoding. The introductory guide to
the archive, aimed at all levels of experience, indicates that this
project draws significantly from a non-specialist and community
knowledge.

The second project, /The Peter Still Papers/, based at Rutgers
University, collects and publishes correspondence (1850-1875) relating
to former slave Peter Still’s attempts to purchase freedom for his
wife and children in Alabama, and includes letters by William Lloyd
Garrison, Horace Greeley, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. This “Documentary
Edition” makes selective use of tags based on the TEI-Lite model, with
the goal of bringing out a particular narrative among the papers:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Our intention with the markup has been to produce a rough idea of the
/aboutness/ of each letter, and not to count every reference to a
person or a place. Consequently, the persName and placeName tags have
been used selectively.... in the personography file, we have made an
attempt to include only those people who were significant in Peter
Still’s world, namely family, friends, and people who helped or
hindered him in his mission. /The Peter Still Papers/ 2015-2022, "About"
#+END_QUOTE
Their minimalist tagging scheme reflects an inventive approach toward
the structural limitations surrounding the creation of the archive:
first, the scope of the documents themselves, none of which are
written in Still’s hand, reflect what editors describe as “only one
side of a conversation, punctuated by many gaps and omissions” (The
Peter Still Papers 2015-2022, "About). Additionally, like the /Editing
the Eartha M.M. White Collection/, this project draws from a range of
skillsets, specifically from non-specialists in American history, as
“no member of the project team is a historian by training, nor expert
in the period in question” (The Peter Still Papers 2015-2022,
“About”).

Both archives work within limited structures–both institutional and
informational–toward collaborative and community-oriented encoding
approaches. They demonstrate that resistance is not just another
formal experiment, where non-normative bodies challenge subscription
into an oppressive mainstream. It is a political project that
foregrounds that which cannot be incorporated into a mainstream
identity.




*** Quotes to add:

creating elements and attributes that reflect black life (Jessica
H. Lu and Caitlin Pollock).
- "Black DH Schema" project. TEI as a tool that can be critiqued and
disrupted, that centers black people, lives, cultures, rather than
relegates to the margins. Can there be a schema that supports and
encourages black dh work, confirm and amplify black humanity rather
than perpetuate power structures.

creating elements and attributes that:
- cite black women
- chosen names vs imposed names, unnamed. 
- land acknowledgement - place name
- tags for code-switching
- tags for places beyond geographical point, "the corner," "kitchen
  table", digital spaces.
- tags that reflect complexity of black kinship and family, including
  role names.

DH as a field is slow to incorporate cultural criticism (Liu). 



*** qualitative expansion
Yet, TEI tags and attributes add /qualitative/ information to
data. Markup can support a number of encoding approaches, including
"conceptual," "declarative," "logical," "structural," and "semantic."
Although it has a default set of tags and attributes, TEI has been
praised for its customizability, which it inherits from its parent
language, XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Individual encoding
projects often create their own custom schemas that reflect the
priority of each document. And, due to the collective nature of the
TEI, which is developed and maintained by the TEI Consortium, the
guidelines are continually updated to accomodate the needs of
encoders.
