"Spend more time on these exciting questions around the limitations of
TEI, and on the topics in the last section and conclusion. Not much
space is given to the TEI approach the author is using in Wilde’s text
in comparison to the other sections, and what the author’s original
customisation of TEI achieves. I would suggest a reframing of the
article to focus more on how the tagging releases textual meanings
within this text in reference to Wilde’s revisions, how TEI offers new
methods to read these revisions and their potential forms, how the
themes that characterise the revisions operate and contribute to the
markup, and how this visualises queer form and its slippery affects or
coded elements within the text. The close attention to the varied
physical pen strokes and marks on the pages within Wilde’s revisions
and the parallels with the conceptual homoerotic elements of the edits
is highly interesting and would benefit from more exploration within
the article."

While the author’s central research question (Julia Flanders’ do we

Similarly, the author makes too much use of phrases such as “Now I

filler phrases and make the article feel over-signposted at
times. Likewise, “I will give a general overview…” (p.2) is
unnecessary. Consider simply opening the Textual Scholarship section
with “Dominant editorial practices increasingly delimit…”

** Introduction
**** DONE create hook - 'suggest something vile' 
     CLOSED: [2021-11-12 Fri 21:55]
In the first scene of the novel, /The Picture of Dorian Gray/ (1891),
the painter Basil Hallward is at pains to explain to his friend Lord
Henry Wotton why he cannot exhibit the portrait of the eponymous
hero. Basil makes the following striking statement: "Where there is
merely love, they would see something evil, where there is spectacular
passion, they would suggest something vile" (Wilde, 1889–90,
p. 21). This fascinating line, among many others that carry homoerotic
innuendos, never appeared in print. It was struck during Oscar Wilde's
revision process, as part of a larger project of suppressing
suggestions of homoeroticism between the three main characters of the
story. Literary and textual scholars have long speculated over Wilde's
intentions as he revised the text into its periodical and book
versions (/DG 90/, /DG 91/, respectively). One scholar, Nicolas
Ruddick, argues that Wilde revised the text in order to emphasize one
moral about the dangers of vanity at the expense of another, more
implicit, moral about the liberalization of homosexuality. Ruddick
explains that, while the first moral "dramatize[s] the disastrous
consequences of the preference of the beautiful at the expense of the
good," the second one, by contrast, "explores the destructive effects
of the clandestine or closeted life" (Ruddick, 2003, p. 126,
128). This leaves one with the suspicion that, perhaps, Wilde may have
struck the line from the manuscript for a similar reason that Basil
could not exhibit the portrait.

This paper examines Wilde's revisionary practice over the first
chapter of the manuscript of /The Picture of Dorian Gray/. It uses a
digital tool to register and describe the homoerotic elements that
Wilde struck from the text. This electronic editing tool, called the
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI, explained further below) allows
researchers to "mark up" the deletions, additions, and other
alternations that obscure the homoeroticism of the manuscript. This
project uses TEI markup not only to interrogate the nature of Wilde's
revisions, but also the potential for technological tools to engage
queerness in text. In doing so, it endeavors to answer a question that
plagues the emerging field of Queer Digital Humanities, or Queer
DH. As literary and electronic textual scholar Julia Flanders
asks--/do we need to queer markup, or is markup already queerable?/ By
"already queerable," Flanders refers to TEI's inherent
customizability, which allows researchers to create descriptive
schemas that suit their project's needs. The potential for
customization, according to Flanders, allows researchers to "imagine
descriptive systems for identity that would operate in specific
contexts (rather than totalizing contexts)... with appropriate places
for saying 'there is also something incontestable here'" (Flanders,
2017).

**** DONE expand approaches to Queer DH
     CLOSED: [2021-10-26 Tue 10:16]

Flander's question--how technology works with or against
queerness--interrogates TEI's place between two current approaches in
Queer DH. The first approach wants to disrupt formal systems by
imagining alternative ones; and second, the approach in which
queerness is built into computing, is inherent in computational
logic. The first approach tends to center around speculative or
critical making projects that problematize the constructed nature of
technical objects. For example, Zach Blas and micha cárdenas propose a
suite of programming tools with functions such as the
"destabilizationLoop," that "breaks apart any process that acts as a
continuously iterating power," and "nonteleo()," which "strips any
program of a goal-oriented result" (2007-2012). Their /transCoder/
project, a "queer programming anti-language," is a speculative
codebase that disrupts the expectated functionality of our tools
(Blas, cárdenas, 2007-2012). Another project that probes the
possibilities of queering digital tools is "Queer OS: A User’s
Manual," which is a set of guidelines that describe how various
components of an operating system, such as interfaces, applications,
and memory might function within an ethos of queerness. For example,
this project reconceives how a digital interface "might seek out
self-modification as its ontological premise... transform[ing] both
the user and the system" (Barnett et al, 2016). This work, along with
Blas and cárdenas, expose and interrogate the ways that technology
reduces, delimits, or determines queer identity and practices. As the
creators of /QueerOS/ affirm: "This is a speculative proposition for a
project that does not yet exist and may never come to exist, a project
that does not yet function and may never function" (Barnett et al,
2016). The other side of the debate explores how current technological
systems and tools already contain elements that encourage queer modes
of analysis. For example, work by Jacob Gaboury explores how the NULL
value in computation signals a "refusal to cohere, to become legible"
as a built-in option in computational systems. Gaboury explains how
the NULL value "corresponds with the epistemological condition of
queerness as an excessive illegibility collapsed into an unwieldy
frame, an aberrant third-ness within an otherwise normative system of
relations" (Gaboury, 2018). In his work on "The Queer History of
Computing," Gaboury asserts that "queerness is itself inherent to
computational logic... there exists a structuring logic to
computational systems that, while nearly totalizing, does not account
for all forms of knowledge, which excludes certain acts, behaviors,
and modes of being" (Gaboury, 2013, par. 13).
**** DONE intervention language; queer encoding
     CLOSED: [2021-11-12 Fri 22:53]
In attempt to cut between these debates, this paper identifies one
major "constraint" of TEI which enables the analysis of queerness in
Wilde's manuscript revisions. TEI's constraint is that it works best
with data that is discrete, rather than smooth or ambiguous data, like
the homoerotic elements obscured by Wilde's pen. In this project, I
apply the rigid structure of the TEI toward marking up and analyzing
the smooth data of the text's homoerotic themes, which include
"intimacy," "beauty," "passion," and "fatality." The fixed nature of
the TEI as a naming and bounding tool allows me to explore the
boundaries of these queer themes in the text. This experiment in
"queer encoding" bases the challenge of marking homoerotic elements as
a foundation for theorizing queer engagements with computational
methods. It does so by bringing researchers to reconsider their roles
in acts of marking and labelling textual data. 

** Textual Scholarship
In analyzing the changes of the manuscript, I draw from debates in two
fields that inform my approach for homoerotic subject matter within
digital contexts: Textual Scholarship and Queer Historiography. I draw
out a parallel debate from within these fields about what to do with
what electronic editing scholar Jerome McGann calls our "textual
inheritance" (McGann, 2001, p. xi). The parallel debate across these
fields will allow me to carve out a methodology for working with TEI
to analyze queer literary material. 

This parallel occurs in the debates between editorial and
historiographic methodologies in these fields, which can be loosely
grouped into what I call the "productive" and "restorative"
approaches. In Textual Scholarship, these approaches pose editorial
practices that increasingly delimit the role of the editor as a
recoverer or preserver of texts and those practices that permit
empower the editor as an enabler of textual readings. The history of
Textual Criticism first tends toward the restorative approach, which
is about "correcting" an "ideal" text according to a prior
witness. Then, spurred by the advent of digital technology and the
popularization of digital tools, editing becomes more about finding
ways to multiply the text's potential forms and readings.

**** DONE streamline narrative, cutting down to necessary elements,

taking out deformance (?) 

The "restorative approach" begins with the work of Ronald B. McKerrow,
a leading twentieth-century Shakespearean scholar, who maintains that
the goal of scholarly editing is to preserve authorial
intention. McKerrow's influential model for "copy-text" editing, which
establishes the base-text for editing on an early witness that most
closely resembles the author's original intention, eventually gives
way to Walter W. Greg's approach that expands critics' purview to more
than a single witness. Subsequently, Fredson Bowers and Thomas
Tanselle advance Greg's work, emphasizing the influence of authorial
intention and favoring the "eclectic edition," which depends heavily
on the editor's judgment to determine authorial intention from
multiple sources.[fn:11] Tanselle in particular places a high value in
the editor who is the only one able to recognize and handle inevitable
textual corruption. Guiding Tanselle's position is his claim that a
text is vessel for an ideal "work" that can only be realized by the
editor:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of
it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in
sound waves... its medium is neither visual nor auditory. The medium
of literature is the words (whether already existent or newly created)
of a language; and arrangements of words according to the syntax of
some language (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses
or punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are
reported by voice or in writing. Tanselle, 1989, p. 16-17
#+END_QUOTE
Tanselle explains that because the act of inscription involves
physical tools that corrupt the writer's pure ideas, the writer
requires an editor whose distance from the creation of enables his
objective evaluation of its intention.

Toward the end of the 20th century, D.F. McKenzie's theory of "the
sociology of text" challenges the claim that no single text,
regardless of scrupulous editing by the critic, can represent an
"ideal" version. According to McKenzie, the book is never a single
object, but a product of a number of human agencies and mechanical
techniques that are historically situated: "Every society rewrites its
past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have any continuing
life at all, at some point every printer redesigns them" (McKenzie,
1986, p. 25). Jerome McGann explores how this sociological perspective
expands into digital editing environments, where electronic formats
create opportunities for presenting textual variation. McGann explains
that textual criticism in print format is limited because a print text
must conform to the linear and two-dimensional form of the codex--the
same form as its object of study. Digital editions, by contrast, can
be designed for complex, reflexive, and ongoing interactions between
reader and text. McGann notes that his work on the digital /Rossetti
Archive/ brought him to repeatedly reconsider his earlier conception
and goals, explaining that the archive "seemed more and more an
instrument for imagining what we didn’t know" (McGann, 2016,
p. 82). McGann's approach counters the traditional fidelity toward
authorial intention with a drive to harness the potentiality of
textual variation. The transformation of literary material into
electronic format becomes a vehicle for a critical analytical method
that McGann and Lisa Samuels call "deformative criticism." Deformative
criticism works by distorting, disordering, or re-assembling literary
material, continually subscribing the text to new configurations, in
order to estrange the reader from her familiarity of the text. This
estrangement forces the reader to encounter the text in a new way and
discover new insights about its formal significance and meaning.

** Queer Historiography
**** DONE expand Halperin & Traub positions & add quote
     CLOSED: [2021-11-12 Fri 23:51]
Two competing approaches in Queer Historiography parallel the
"restorative" and "productive" approaches from Textual
Scholarship. Susan McCabe defines "Queer Historicism" as the "critical
trend of locating 'identifications' (rather than than identity), modes
of being and having, in historical contexts" (McCabe, 2005,
p. 120). In Queer Historiography, contemporary critics ofen debate the
extent to which they in the present can adequately define queerness in
the past. On the "restorative" side, there is the "Queer Historicist"
position, advocated by scholars like David Halperin and Valerie Traub,
who maintain that homosexuality is historically constructed, that
"queerness" means something different today than it does in the past,
and that we can get at its meaning by employing a Foucauldian
genealogical method. For example, Halperin characterizes homosexual
identity as a modern cultural production: "no single category of
discourse or experience existed in the premodern and non-Western
worlds that comprehended exactly the same range of same-sex sexual
behaviors... that now fall within the capacious definitional
boundaries of homosexuality" (Halperin, 2000, p. 88). On the
"productive" side are the "unhistoricists," including Jonathan
Goldberg and Madhavi Menon who are wary of historiographical methods
that demarcate queer subjectivity across history in ways that imply
progress. They maintain that one can not fully define "queer," and the
attempt to do so would subscribe queerness to teleology (Goldberg,
Menon, 2005, p. 1609). Goldberg and Menon caution that
historiographical methods that attempt to pin down "queer" throughout
history have the effect of normalizing (and therefore evacuating)
queerness: "to produce queerness as an object of our scrutiny would
mean the end of queering itself" (2005, 1608). In response to this
"unhistoricist" position, Valerie Traub argues that "queer" would lose
its value if applied ahistorically: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Queer's free-floating, endlessly mobile, and infinitely subversive
capacities may be strengths--allowing queer to accomplish strategic
maneuvers that no other concept does--but its principled imprecision
implies analytic limitations... if queer is intelligible only in
relation to its social norms, and if the concept of normality itself
is of relatively recent vintage (Locherie), then the relations between
queer and the changing configurations of gender and sexuality need to
be defined and redefined. Traub, 2013, p. 33
#+END_QUOTE
According to Traub and the historicists, queerness requires historical
specificity in order to be legible.

Heather Love refocuses this debate to examine the relationship between
the critic and the object of study. Love makes the argument that,
ultimately, the queer historian cannot validate the queerness of the
past. However, although queer subjects fail to fit within contemporary
conceptions of identity and desire, the project of queer history
continues. Love explains that "Queer history has been an education in
absence: the experience of social refusal and of the denigration of
homosexual love has taught us the lessons of solitude and heartbreak"
(Love, 2009, p. 52). Her methodology takes negative affects like shame, anger,
disgust, hatred, disappointment as phenomena that cannot be resolved,
recuperated, or rescued by the queer historian. Rather than attempt
fix the past, Love offers the methodology of "feeling backward," an
accounting of "the social, psychic, and corporeal effects of
homophobia" (Love, 2009, p. 2). By "feeling backward," Love is interested in
exploring the way that subjects turn away or refuse the critic's
attempt to "redeem" or "rescue" them: She gives the example of the myth of Orpheus
and Eurydice, pointing out that Orpheus /prefers/ to behold Eurydice
in the darkness of the Underworld rather than in the
sunlight [fn:5]. Love explains that this is a crucial lesson for queer
critics:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[Eurydice's] specific attraction for queer subjects is an effect, I
want to argue, of a historical experience of love as bound up with
loss. To recognize Eurydice as desirable in her turn away is a way of
identifying through that loss. Such an approach would be consistent
with an important aspect of contemporary queer politics, which has
tended to define community not as constituted by a shared set of
traits, but rather as emerging from a shared experience of social
violence. Love, 2009, p. 51
#+END_QUOTE
Although Orpheus intends to rescue her, bringing Eurydice into the
light of day would transform her into something fully accessible, and
therefore less desirable.

**** DONE what TEI will allow me to do & 'queer form'
     CLOSED: [2021-11-13 Sat 00:49]
Like Textual Scholarship, the field of Queer Historiography is plagued
by the problem of what to do with the past. The impulse that Love
describes of the queer theorist to "rescue" queer figures evokes
Tanselle's aim to recover the ideal text in scholarly editing. Love,
however, knows this rescue is impossible:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Such is the relation of the queer historian to the past: we cannot
help wanting to save the figures from the past, but this mission is
doomed to fail. In part, this is because the dead are gone for good;
in part, because the queer past is even more remote, more deeply
marked by power's claw... Such a rescue effort can only take place
under the shadow of loss and in the name of loss; success would
constitute failure. Love, 2009, p. 51
#+END_QUOTE
Taking this impossibility as inspiration, one might rethink how to
preserve the queer textual inheritance. Accepting queerness as
something that eludes containment may encourage the critic to plumb
how queerness continues to escaoe critical analysis. Love suggests one
possibility: "a mode of historiography that recognizes the
inevitability of a 'play of recognitions' but that also sees these
recognitions not as consoling but as shattering" (Love, 2009,
p. 45). By "play of recognitions," Love means the critic's "search for
roots and resemblances" in the subject matter (p. 45). Her method of
paying attention to elusive affects without trying to transform them
into something more palatable can also be applied within digital
contexts, and toward productive ends. One may, borrowing from McGann
and Samuel's idea of deformance, reconceive textual editing of queer
material as a formal experiment. Specifically, to explore the way that
electronic editing tools impose new formal structures and
configurations on queer subject matter. TEI is one such tool that
allows researchers to explore the potential of encoding as an exercise
in what Kadji Amin, Amber Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez describe as
"queer form:" "the range of formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies
that make difference a little less knowable, visible, and digestible"
(Amin et al, 2017, p. 235).

     CLOSED: [2021-10-26 Tue 11:55]

Markup with TEI engages a longstanding debate about Wilde's intension
with revising the story's homoerotic elements. Textual scholars like
Donald Lawler, Joseph Bristow, and Nicolas Ruddick claim that Wilde's
changes to the manuscript fit within a larger project of
aestheticization Wilde undertook as he composed and revised the
novel. The surviving manuscript and typescript indicate that Wilde and
his publisher, John Marshall Stoddart, revises his work multiple times
before it is published in /Lippincott's/ on June 20, 1890.[fn:6] This
first printing of "The Picture of Dorian Gray," which spans 98 pages
over 13 chapters, was widely criticized for its seemingly ambiguous
stance on an immoral protagonist. Textual editor Joseph Bristow
explains that "[Wilde’s] narrative struck the [reviewers] as a work
that appeared 'corrupt', displayed 'effeminate frivolity', and dealt
'with matters only fitted for the Criminal Investigation Department/'"
(2000, p. xviii). Wilde would spend the next several days defending
his work in letters to the editors, entering into a public
correspondence with them.[fn:7]

A few months later, in the early spring of 1891, Wilde publishes a
"Preface" that makes such claims as "Those who find ugly meanings in
beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault"
and "To reveal art and conceal the artist is art’s aim."[fn:25]
Scholar Barbara Lecklie asserts that, by these complex and incisive
statements, "Wilde's strategy is to refocus on art and disparage the
focus on the reader by saying that the reader is the one who makes a
work immoral" (2013, p. 173). Similarly, textual scholar Donald Lawler
argues that "the 'Preface' relates to the novel only obliquely
by... holding up aesthetic beauty and artistic effect as the only
legitimate criteria of critical evaluation" (1988. p. 16). Published
in a book version by Ward, Lock & Company in April 1891, the next
edition of /Dorian Gray/ contains 20 chapters including the "Preface."
According to the editor of the /Uncensored Edition/ of /Dorian Gray/,
Victor Frankel, Wilde here makes significant deletions of passages
with explicit homosexual references, promiscuous or illicit
heterosexuality, and "anything that smacked generally of decadence"
(2011. pp. 47-48). Wilde also "heighten Dorian’s monstrosity toward
the novel’s conclusion" to bring the story "to a moral conclusion that
he thought would silence his critics" (Frankel, 2011, p. 30).

The textual scholarship on /Dorian Gray/ generally agrees that Wilde's
revisions of the homoerotic elements are part of a larger project of
aestheticizing the text. One way of achieving this aestheticization is
by suppressing the moral of the story which, Wilde himself states is
that "all excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own
punishment" (Wilde, 1890, cited in Wilde, Gillespie, 2007,
p. 355-356). Lawler explains that "the dominant motive underlying all
of the important changes made by Wilde was an artistic desire to
supress an underlying moral which Wilde considered too obvious and,
for that reason, distracting" (1988, 2). Lawler adds that "the
offensive passages shown above in the notes were cut because of their
mawkish and sentimental writing as much for their affront to
contemporary moral standards" (1988, p. 65). Nicolas Ruddick, as
explained above, argues that two morals are at play in this text--one
about the dangers of vanity, and the other, about the liberalization
of homosexuality. He explains that the two morals associate vanity and
closeted homosexuality with corruption: "the appalling changes to
Dorian’s painted image in /DG90/ strongly suggest that the unspeakable
practices indulged in by the protagonist are unspeakable in
themselves" (Ruddick, 2003, p. 129). Ruddick contends that Wilde, as
he revised the text, "chose the route of suppression" by reducing the
homoerotic elements and including a preface protecting art from the
moral judgement (2003, p. 133).

** TEI introduction
**** DONE combine first two paragraphs which intro TEI
     CLOSED: [2021-10-21 Thu 09:29]

TEI allows researchers to work productively with textual data by
creating formal structures that can mark and register desired elements
of the text. TEI (short for Text Encoding Initiative), is an
electronic editing standard for digitizing textual elements so that
computers can "read" them. In more technical terms, TEI is a "markup
language," that enables users to "mark up" aspects of literary texts
that they think are important, like structural elements (chapters,
paragraphs, line breaks), physical details about the text (revisions,
illegible text) or conceptual elements (like persons or
places). Created specifically for working with literary material, TEI
offers a set of guidelines for transcribing and editing print text or
manuscripts into electronic format. The guidelines contains rules for
using various "tags" to mark up certain textual elements, such as
~<line>~ to indicate a line of text, ~<del>~, to indicate deleted
text, and ~<person>~, for a reference to a person. Below is an image
of a manuscript and its diplomatic transcription, along an excerpt of
the underlying TEI code, from Mary Shelley's manuscript of
/Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus/ (1818), encoded by the
Shelley-Godwin Archive (see Fig. 4).

Through this level of detail, TEI facilitates deep and complex

As in the above example, TEI documents resemble an ordered hierarchy
or nested tree structure, with the one "root" component and several
"branches," known as "nodes." This hierarchical nature of the TEI
means that all elements in the text must be contained as discrete
nodes within this bounded structure, where one cannot overlap
elements. Though the strict tagging structure of TEI forces encoders
to label textual elements as discrete data, it also enables them to
create their own labels for the elements. Perhaps the most useful
aspect about TEI is this customizability, which it inherits from its
parent language, XML, or eXtensible Markup Language. As an
"extensible" language, TEI enables users to to create their own tags
to describe the particular elements they wish to encode. /The Women
Writers Project/, directed by Julia Flanders, adequately frames how
TEI's inherent extensibility can address textual ambiguity. According
to the /WWP/:
#+BEGIN_SOURCE 
Unlike many standardization efforts, the TEI ... explicitly
accommodat[es] variation and debate within its technical
framework. The TEI Guidelines are designed to be both modular and
customizable, so that specific projects can choose the relevant
portions of the TEI and ignore the rest, and can also if necessary
create extensions of the TEI language to describe facets of the text
which the TEI does not yet address. Flanders, 1999-2021
#+END_SOURCE
Because TEI is built from a language that allows its users to build
their own version of that language, there is potential for
representing the elements necessary to a project by customizing these
elements on a project-by-project basis.

**** TODO incorporate Boyd in some way (?) - maybe in discreteness
**** DONE add reference to 'queer encoding'
     CLOSED: [2021-10-22 Fri 10:38]
As queer studies scholars well know, however, there are always
elements that cannot be contained within rigid
categories. Accordingly, there are a number of projects that explore
the potential of TEI for what Julia Flanders calls "queer encoding."
The encoding of queer gender, is one interesting case study because
the ~<person>~ tag, which describes persons referenced within a text,
is limited to one value for gender. For scholars working to encode
multiple or diverse sexual identities, this data structure creates
obstacles. Pamela Caughie and Sabine Meyer, for example, attempt to
encode gender identity in /Man Into Woman/, the life narrative of
Danish painter Lili Elbe who undertook one of the first gender
affirming surgeries in 1930. The attempt to mark up Elbe's complex
gender ontology brought Caughie and Meyer against this structural
limitation of the TEI which cannot accomodate plural sexual
identities:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[T]he deeper we got into mark-up, the more evident it became that the
categories and hierarchies available to us were inadequate for our
task... to identify a male subject who at times presents himself as
masquerading as a woman, at others as being inhabited by one, and who
eventually becomes a woman, in a life history narrated retrospectively
from the perspective of Lili Elbe. Caughie, Meyer, 2018, p. 231
#+END_QUOTE
Interestingly, the TEI forces these scholars to consider the ways that
computation works on a deeper level to reify gender as essential. In
particular, the fixity that the TEI imposes upon Elbe as a queer
subject brings out the ways that gender is situational and relational
across this text.

Other scholars find advantage in TEI's data structure. While TEI is
strict about what constitutes a person--as an entity with one sex, for
example--it also enables an approach toward personhood as
multiple. Like Caughie and Meyer, Marion Thain also works with a
complex writing subject, the late-19th-century English poet, Michael
Field, which is a pen name for the lesbian couple, Katharine Bradley
and Edith Cooper. Thain works to encode the diaries of Michael Field
who, according to Thain, signifies "the assumed names of two separate
women, as well as appearing to signify one single male identity"
(Thain, 2016, p. 228). Fortunately for Thian, the TEI enables the
encoding of multiple identities, which is central for understanding
the queerness of the diaries:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[T]he proliferation and slipperiness of names is no mere childish
caprice but a core part of the articulation of queer: an unhinging of
'given' or apparently predetermined identity through a strategy that
articulates identity as constantly shifting, constructed, and
performative. Text encoding can, in a simple but powerful way, help us
explore and map this crucial strand of queer identity construction
across the diary. Thain, 2016, p. 233
#+END_QUOTE
Thain's approach harnesses the hierarchical nature of the TEI to list
the various references to each personage within the ~<persName>~
tag. This ~<persName>~ tag allows Thain to "render searchable words
not in the text but intimately tied to it. This is not a small issue
in a diary in which Katharine Bradley herself is referred to by more
than 20 different names" (Thain, 2016, p. 233). By encoding each
identity to its proper personage, TEI enables Thain to solve the
manage the of multiple identities in this text.


Why do Caughie and Meyer struggle to encode Elbe's identity while
Thain appears to succeed with Field? While a queerness like Fields's
might be delineated and contained, in Elbe's there is a quality of
blending which the markup, by its nature, means to separate and fix.
As Flanders points out, markup, as a tool for naming, bounding, and
containment, registers information as distinct components, rather than
smooth information with vague boundaries (Flanders, 2017). Field's
identity is /multiple/: the diaries "do not pretend to record the life
of a single male, as two different hands record the experience of two
clearly differentiated people" (Thain, 2016, p. 229). As long as
identities, like Field's, are distinct and contained within specific
entities, TEI can encode them. Elbe's identity, by contrast, is not
multiple as much as it is plural, containing several identities whose
relationship to each other is ambiguous or continually shifting within
one entity. Elbe's relation to gender is best described qualitatively,
as one that alternatively masquerades or inhabits simultaneous
gender ontologies (Caughie, Meyer, 2018, p. 231). 

** The Manuscript of /Dorian Gray/
**** DONE categorizing smooth info as exercise in queer encoding
     CLOSED: [2021-10-28 Thu 11:10]
For Wilde's text in particular, the rigid structure of the TEI tags
offer an opportunity for exploring the potential of bounding and
labelling as an exercise in "queer encoding." I created a
customization that explores the potential of semantic labelling
against the demands for fixity and structure within the TEI schema. My
customization registers physical and conceptual changes to the /MS/ by
creating two new attributes to mark the revisions. First, to mark the
physical traces of Wilde's pen as he struck out portions of the text,
the custom attribute, "strokes" (~@strokes~ in formal TEI notation),
registers the number of pen strokes through any given section of
text. Most often, Wilde uses one or two strokes of his pen, although
sometimes, the strokes are too heavy or thick to enumerate, in which
case, I set the ~@strokes~ attribute to the value, "inconclusive." In
addition to ~@strokes~, the custom attribute ~@implication~ marks the
general theme of revision from a list of recurring themes, which
include: "intimacy," "beauty," "passion," and "fatality," with the
additional values of "inconclusive" or "illegible."

In what follows, I detail how this customization registers the
elisions and conversions of homoeroticism in the /MS/ as Wilde
prepared it for publication. That being said, the goal here is not to
establish a formal method for marking queer elements. Rather, this
work surfaces a formal resistance in the text--an indeterminacy that
resists capture by TEI data structure. Here, the difficulty is in
engaging the boundedness of the TEI elements, which must encapsulate
data, with the indistinctiveness of the queerness of the text, which
resist demarcation within the four themes of "intimacy," "beauty,"
"passion," and "fatality." Often, the boundaries between these
elements are fuzzy or blurred, constituting a spectrum of smooth
information that threatens the confines of the tags. To add another
layer of ambiguity, the number of pen strokes also resists easy
demarcation. Depending on Wilde's pen, they can be difficult to
enumerate and their boundaries often fail to map with the
themes. Therefore, in order to mark up this text, one must make
imposing decisions on its data.

**** DONE high level summary of patterns in the themes
     CLOSED: [2021-11-13 Sat 14:32]
The evocative opening scene, which consists of a lively dialogue
between Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton, sets the tone, reveals
character dynamics, and lays out some of the conflict for the ensuing
story. In these first few pages, Basil comes across as a sympathetic,
sensitive, albeit slightly exasperated artist, who confides to his
close friend Lord Henry the powerful influence that Dorian Gray has
had upon his life and work. Lord Henry, by contrast, appears as an
affable and witty gentleman aesthete, who counters Basil’s
confessional utterances with offbeat and pardoxical observations.

A few general patterns emerge from the revisions across these
pages. First, the revisions work to stifle the emotional tension and
physical affection in the dialogue between Basil and Lord Henry,
replacing it with a lighter or more neutral tone. Because these
revisions generally work to shore up the friendship between Basil and
Lord Henry, conveying the fondness in their rapport, they are encoded
according to the theme of "intimacy." Second are the themes of
"beauty" and "passion," which mostly concern revisions where Dorian is
reformulated from a romantic object into an artistic subject for
Basil's painting. Third, and finally, the theme of "fatality," which
focus heavily on moments when Basil struggles to explain the consuming
and self-destructive effects of Dorian's influence on his life.  that
Dorian's has on his life.

**** DONE intimacy/fatality
     CLOSED: [2021-11-05 Fri 12:50]
Beginning with the revisions that suppress suggestions of intimacy
between the three main characters. Wilde’s pen slashes through
evidence of physical contact between Basil, Lord Henry, and
Dorian. These include Basil "taking hold of his [Lord Henry’s] hand"
(p. 9), Basil recounting that Dorian's "cheek just brushed my
[Basil's] cheek" (p. 20), and that Basil and Dorian "sit beside each
other" (p. 22). Additionally, the dialogue between Basil and Lord
Henry develops an intimacy in their tone and subtle mannerisms, an
intimacy that facilitates Basil's confession of his feelings for
Dorian. In some casese, Wilde diminishes this intimacy in their
conversation with the effect of mitigating the sense of foreboding
that surrounds Basil's attraction to Dorian. Wilde replaces tense
pauses with laughter or exchanges dramatic statements and descriptions
with more playful ones. One striking example occurs when Basil
struggles to convey his reasoning for refusing to exhibit Dorian's
portrait:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"The reason why I will not exhibit this picture, is that I am afraid
that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul."

Lord Henry hesitated for a moment. ‘And what is that?’ he asked, in a
low voice. ‘I will tell you,’ said Hallward, and a look of pain came
over his face. ‘Don’t if you would rather not,’ murmured his
companion, looking at him." p. 9
#+END_QUOTE
The revised version in the manuscript, incorporating the deletions and
interlinear additions, reads: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
"The reason why I will not exhibit this picture, is that I am afraid
that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul."

Lord Henry laughed. ‘And what is that?’  he asked. ‘I will tell you,’
said Hallward, and an expression of perplexity came over his face. ‘I
am all expectation Basil,’ murmured his companion, looking at him. p. 9
#+END_QUOTE
Here, several changes mitigate the emotions of the scene. First,
rather than "hesitate," Lord Henry "laugh[s]," and he no longer speaks
“in a low voice": the effect is to overwrite a previously intimate
moment with levity. Basil also exchanges his facial expression from
one of agony to confusion when “a look of pain” becomes “an expression
of perplexity” (discussed further below). And lastly, Lord Henry,
rather than sympathizing with his friend and releasing him from the
impulse to explain himself, instead encourages him to speak--"I am all
expectation, Basil."  Together, these changes work obscure Basil’s
internal suffering with the effect of lightening the mood of the
scene.

Another example similarly tempers an intense emotional energy while
also mitigating a sense of anxiety or foreboding. It occurs on the
next page, when Basil is on the verge of revealing the reasons behind
his attraction for Dorian. The original dialogue proceeds:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,
and he heard his own breath, with a sense almost of fear. ‘Yes. There
is very little to tell you,’ whispered Hallward, ‘and I am afraid you
will be disappointed. Two months ago...' p. 10
#+END_QUOTE
The manuscript’s revised version reads: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,
and he wondered what was coming. 'Yes. There is very little to tell
you,' whispered Hallward rather bitterly, 'and I dare say you will be
disappointed. Two months ago...' p. 10
#+END_QUOTE
Here, rather than draw attention to Lord Henry’s breathing, Wilde
mentions Lord Henry’s “wonder” about Basil’s pending explanation,
shifting Lord Henry’s sense of anticipation from fear to curiosity. He
also makes slight changes to Basil’s delivery: in the revised version,
Basil speaks “rather bitterly” and uses the expression “I dare say”
rather than “I am afraid”. Both changes diminish the confessional tone
that originally precedes Basil’s revelation about Dorian Gray.

Across this dialogue, the close rapport between Basil and Lord Henry
enables Basil's confession about the self-consuming qualities of his
feelings for Dorian. Therefore, the theme of intimacy implicates that
of fatality. The data structure of the TEI, however, fails to capture
this complicated dynamic. Intimacy and fatality cannot both be
expressed in the ~@implication~ attribute, which is limited to one
value. Therefore, the encoder must choose one theme per item of
revision, either "intimacy" or "fatality."

**** DONE beauty/passion word shifts to dilute powerful connotations
     CLOSED: [2021-11-06 Sat 09:54]
Often throughout this chapter, Wilde swaps out words with the effect
of diluting or diverting the original connotation. He focuses this
type of revision on Basil’s dialogue, when Basil speaks about his
passionate attachment to Dorian, and the effect of Dorian's beauty
upon his art. Here, Wilde will trade expressive nouns with words that
convey relatively weaker or more generalized ideas. For example, in
the sentence "Every portrait that is painted with passion is a
portrait of the artist, not of the sitter," Basil replaces "passion"
with "feeling" in the manuscript (p. 9), exchanging the romantic
connotation of "passion" with a more neutral one of "feeling."

On page 11, Wilde swaps out words and phrases which connote a strong
sense of romantic passion for ones that suggest an aesthetic interest
instead. The manuscript, prior to revision, reads: "I knew that I had
[...] come across someone whose mere personality was so fascinating
that it would be Lord over my life, my soul, my art itself
(p. 11). Wilde changes this line to, "I knew that I had come face to
face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that it
would absorb my nature, my soul, my art itself" (p. 11). Here, Wilde
swaps out "life" for "nature," with the effect of subscribing Dorian's
influence to his "nature," that is, part of his personailty or
behavior, rather than encompassing his "life."  Wilde also replaces
"be Lord over" with "absorb," which maintains Basil's sense of
submission to an external force, without the masculine designation in
"Lord." These changes were encoded under the theme of "passion"
because they diffuse the intensity of attraction into a more benign
sensitivity to Dorian's aesthetic influence. The subtle changes in
word choice in this section also begin to gesture to the theme of
fatality, which fully develops over the next several pages.

In addition to words associated with "passion," Wilde often replaces
the word "beauty" in Basil's references to Dorian. In doing so, Wilde
neutralizes the power of Dorian's physical allure. For example, Wilde
changes "Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose
/beauty/ had so stirred me" to "Suddenly I found myself face to face
with the young man whose /personality/ had so strangely stirred me"
(p. 13, my emphasis). The replacement of "beauty" with "personality"
allows Basil to completely avoid mentioning Dorian’s physical
appearance, and the addition of "strangely" serves to mystify Dorian’s
influence over Basil. Throughout the rest of chapter, Wilde makes
several changes that similarly dilute Dorian's powerful appearance: he
replaces "beauty" with "good looks" and he exchanges "beauty" for
"face" two separate times (p. 6, 18). Finally, in reference to Dorian
Gray, the word "Narcissus" is replaced with "man" (p. 13).

Like the changes with "passion," the subtle shifts in word choice with
"beauty" and related words diverts the original connotation. Here, the
decision to replace "beauty" with references to "face" or "good looks"
maintains the emphasis on the physical while muting the suggestive
power of "beauty" in the abstract. In doing so, connotations about the
ideal, the charming, and the alluring, which usually accompany
descriptions of beauty, are redirected toward material attributes,
which evacuate Dorian's mysterious allure and diminish the
overwhelming influence that he holds over Basil.

Removing associations to beauty and passion is part of a larger
project of Dorian's aestheticization, where Dorian is transformed from
an erotic into an aesthetic object. At the end of the first chapter,
Basil implores Lord Henry to refrain from influencing the young and
impressionable Dorian. The original version reads:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Don't take away from me the one person that makes life lovely for
me. Mind, Harry, I trust you.' He spoke very slowly, and the words
seemed wrung out of him, almost against his will.

'I don't suppose I shall care for him, and I am quite sure he won't
care for me,' replied Lord Henry smiling, and he took Hallward by the
arm, and almost led him into the house. p. 27-28
#+END_QUOTE
Lord Henry’s assurance that neither he nor Dorian shall "care for"
each other characterizes Basil’s passionate feelings for Dorian as a
kind of possessiveness. However, the source of Basil’s anxiety changes
with the next revision, where Wilde gives him more lines of
explanation and accordingly alters Lord Henry’s response. The revision
thus proceeds:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Don't take away from me the one person that makes life absolutely
lovely to me, and that gives my art whatever wonder or charm it
possesses. Mind. Harry, I trust you.' He spoke very slowly, and the
words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.

'What nonsense you talk,' said Lord Henry smiling, and, taking
Hallward by the arm, he almost led him to the house. p. 27, 27B
#+END_QUOTE
In this revision, Basil attributes an aesthetic value to Dorian,
asserting Dorian’s importance for his art, giving it "whatever wonder
or charm it possesses." Lord Henry’s response moves from reassurance
to dismissal, rejecting Basil’s anxiety as “nonsense,” and ending the
scene on a slightly humorous note. Across these changes, Wilde
reformulates Basil's jealous passion into an anxiety about losing
Dorian as an artistic subject. Additionally, the shift from sincere
reassurance to light-hearted repartee in Lord Henry's response
evacuates the strong emotional tone of the scene, replacing it with
friendly banter. The effect is to divert the suggestion Basil's
passion for Dorian into an aesthetic appreciation.

**** DONE alter to inextricable fatality/passion
     CLOSED: [2021-11-08 Mon 19:34]
Like the interelationship between intimacy and fatality, there exists
an overlap between passion and fatality across Wilde's revisions.
Inextricable from Wilde's project in redirecting Basil's passion
toward artistic ends are the attempts to soften Basil's intense and
consuming devotion to Dorian, a devotion that emerges in references to
Basil's troubled state of mind. One example occurs when Basil recounts
his first meeting with Dorian to Lord Henry, when Basil admits: “I had
a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to him, I would never leave
him till either he or I were dead. I grew afraid, and turned to quit
the room” (/MS/ 12). Here, Basil's passion swells with a life
threatening quality, an intensity that Wilde's pen works to mitigate
by removing the association with death. In the manuscript, Wilde
crosses through “never leave him till either he or I were dead” and
adds “become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought not to speak
to him.” Wilde again tempers the self-consuming quality of Basil's
devotion when he professes that “I could not live if I did not see him
every day" (/MS/ 17). On the manuscript, Wilde changes the line to
read, “I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day” (MS 17). By
shifting the focus from Basil's life to his happiness, Wilde's pen
dilutes the profound peril that Basil's passion has generated.

**** DONE passion/fatality engaging strokes
     CLOSED: [2021-11-09 Tue 10:08]
The TEI data structure reinforces the difficulty of disambiguating the
revisions within the themes of passion and fatality. One phras in
particular, "look of pain," is revised to "an expression of
perplexity" (p. 9, see fig. 6). Working with this revision within the
TEI presents two points of difficulty. First, does the phrase "look of
pain" express passion or fatality? On the one hand, "pain" denotes a
strong, passionate feeling. On the other hand, Basil often draws on
pain in his references to the fatalistic qualities about his
attraction to Dorian, as in the following quote, which was deleted: "I
feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to someone seems to
take a real delight in giving me pain" (p. 23). The difficulty of
disambiguating the theme is mirrored by the strokes of Wilde's pen,
which vary even across the same phrase: while the word "look" is
struck so heavily that the number of strokes are uncountable, the word
"pain" contains a single stroke. With TEI, it is impossible to mark
the variations in strokes without separating the single revision into
two instances, which would break up the integrity of the
phrase. Therefore, the value "inconclusive" is most appropriate for
this change. The incongruity in the number of strokes also points one
in semantic value: the heavier strokes are focused on a revision (from
"look to "expression") that carries less semantic weight than the
single stroke (from "pain" to "perplexity"). Here, the TEI here
demonstrates the arbitrariness of meaning and structure in semantic
markup. In this case, the labelling fails to adequately register the
ways that different components are interrelated, so that marking up
the text does not make its components more amenable to analysis. The
revision remains recalcitrant: keeping relationship between the themes
and the strokes a secret.

**** DONE incorporate strokes: how do they complicate reading/revision
     CLOSED: [2021-11-09 Tue 13:18]

My final example concerns a longer passage (see Figs. 2 & 3) that was
heavily revised in the manuscript. The treatment of this passage
crystallizes the various patterns of revision seen so far—-diminishing
signs of intimacy, passion, and references to Basil's fatalism. The
passage in the manuscript bears quoting in full. Prior to any
revisions, it reads:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
"You remember that landscape of mine... It is one of the best things I
have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it,
Dorian Gray sat beside me, and as he leaned across to look at it, his
cheek just brushed my cheek. The world becomes young to me when I hold
his hand, as when I see him, the centuries yield up all their
secrets!"

"Basil, this is [illegible] you must not talk [illegible] [illegible]
his power, [indecipherable] to make yourself the [illegible] slave! It
is worse than wicked, it is silly. I hate Dorian Gray."

Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the garden. A
curious smile curled his lips. He seemed like a man in a dream. After
some time he came back. ‘You don’t understand, Harry…’ he
said. ‘Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more
present in my work then when no image of him is there. He is simply a
suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the curves
of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain
colours. That is all.’

‘Then why won’t you exhibit his picture?’

‘Because I have put into it the romance of which I have never dared to
speak to him. He knows nothing about it, but the world might guess it,
where there is merely love, they would see something evil, where there
is spectacular passion, they would suggest something vile.' p. 20-21

Figure 2: Image of manuscript passage beginning on MS 20 from The
Morgan Library and Museum.

[[./fig_3.png]]
Figure 3: Image of manuscript passage ending on MS 21 from The
Morgan Library and Museum.

What remains legible of this passage suffice to draw some conclusions
about Wilde’s revision practice. First, in the opening paragraph, the
encoding is complicated by the layered levels of revision. Wilde
eliminates a span of text, from "and as he leaned" to
"secrets!". Within this span, Wilde makes additional changes, adding
text like "hair just touched my hand" (see fig. 2). Due to its
physical nature, this particular phrase is marked as "intimacy" in the
TEI, while the longer section is enclosed by the label of "passion,"
which denotes the nature of the other revisions within the same
sentence, like "The world becomes young to me when I hold his hand"
(see fig. 3). The TEI here enables a layered approach to markup, where
one element can be nested within another.

[[./fig_8.png]]
Figure 8: detail on MS 20 from the Morgan Library and Museum.

[[./fig_9.png]]
Figure 9: TEI encoding for /MS/ 20 detail

While this first paragraph is legible, the next one, by contrast, is
almost completely blotted out. It consists of Lord Henry’s
condemnatory and jealous protestations--"his power," "to make yourself
the... slave!"  and "I hate Dorian Gray." Here, Wilde obscures the
fatalistic conntoations of Basil's passion, which exasperates Lord
Henry. Accordingly, the revision is marked as "fatality" and the
strokes as "inconclusive."

Most of the third paragraph is preserved, presumably, for the way it
furthers Dorian's aestheticization. Here, Basil elaborates upon
Dorian's aesthetic influence--as an artistic ideal that inspires the
apprehension of beauty in the natural world. In the following
paragraph, however, Wilde alters obscures much of language, which
revolves around the theme of passion and fatality. On the theme of
fatality, the small adjustment from "would" to "might" eliminates a
sense of inevitability about Basil's feelings for Dorian. On the theme
of passion, the relevatory line: "where there is merely love, they
would see something evil, where there is spectacular passion, they
would suggest something vile" is completely struck out. This statement
clarifies the Dorian's importance for Basil: he exudes a powerful
allure that suffuses Basil's art with beauty. Noteably, the strokes
over the phrase "suggest something vile" are doubled, which cannot be
encoded in TEI without separating the revision into two
instances. Here, the text's recalcitrance toward encoding recalls
another revision, from "look of pain" to "expression of perplexity"
(p. 9). To mark each element with precision would require separating
into distinct entities what is in fact one act of revision which
contains plural motives. It would involve resolving their
indeterminability into a single intention.

**** DONE conclusion - the themes working interrelatedly
     CLOSED: [2021-11-10 Wed 08:47]
Together, the changes in the mansucript reinforce the scholarship
which claims that Wilde diminishes the homoerotic elements as part of
a larger project to turn Dorian into an aesthetic object. They achieve
this goal in three ways: first, by removing the destructuve
connotations of Basil’s attachment to Dorian; second, by easing the
tension surrounding his dialogue with Lord Henry; and finally, by
emphasizing Dorian as an ideal subject for art.

However, this scholarship has yet to content with the ways that
Wilde's intentionality is distributed among the revisions.  The themes
of intimacy, beauty, passion, and fatality operate in complicated
ways: at times they are plural, co-existing within a single line of
text; more often, they are inextricable, with one enabling the other,
like intimacy and passion which enable fatality; at other times they
enfold one within the other, encompassing a plurality of
intentions. The TEI, which requires strict disambiguation, works to
surface how these themes are working together in ways that cannot be
captured by the markup. Besides registering the indistinctness of the
themes, the TEI also registers the inconsistency of the strokes. In
many cases, the number of strokes appears to have an arbitrary
relation to the theme of revision. There can be multiple strokes for
seemingly innocuous changes, like from "said" to "cried" (p. 8). Or,
there can be single strokes for some of the more fatalistic revisions,
like the line "I would never leave him till either he or I were dead"
(p. 12). In such cases, the strokes appear to have an arbitrary
relationship to the content of the revisions.

** Conclusion: Toward A Queer Form
To resolve some of the inconsistences with the strokes and themes in
this section, one might employ more precise qualitative markers such
as "tension" in addition to "intimacy," or "ardor" and "devotion," in
addition to "passion," for example.  But such tagging would dilute the
analytical utility of the TEI, which is meant to be decisive rather
than exhaustive. Additionally, the more diverse the tags, the less
possibility of finding connections between them.

Additionally, remembering Heather Love's characterization of queerness
as "always bound up with loss," the attempt to "rescue" or "recover"
certain textual elements will only lead to inevitable failure (2009,
p. 51). TEI enables an approach toward queerness as something not to
be resolved, but something to be produced. By encouraging encoders to
impose a level of fixity on the text, TEI allows them to discover
exactly where queerness eludes containment. This computational
constraint of the TEI is an enabling constraint--producing a failed
disambiguation, the TEI reinforces the encoder as the one who ascribes
semantic value to Wilde's revisions. This is perhaps an ironic
disambiguation: the practice of pinning something down only to realize
that such intelligibility is impossible.

That being said, I have tried to tag the homoerotic elements in such a
way that allows them to retain some of their elusiveness, without
attempting to resolve them into something more intelligible. The TEI
has been productive precisely because it requires the encoder to
construct labels for things which, ultimately, cannot be
recovered. Moving forward, we might look at formalizations produced by
this TEI schema not for what it reveals about Wilde's intentions, but
for how ti releases potential readings of his composition
history. Keeping a critical awareness of the TEI limitations, one
might use the tool to mark and visualize /queer form/, particularly
the elusive affects, repressed desires, and other coded elements of
queerness within this text. When grappling with the strict structure
of the TEI, running up against what can and cannot be encoded, one
recognizes what escapes or eludes our structures for understanding and
analyzing queerness to understand, without resolving, new forms of
queerness.

Orpheus must not look at her until they exit the Underworld and
