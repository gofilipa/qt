Caughie --- uses TEI to try to reflect a complex gender ontology. TEI
in this instance fails her, because there is no way to mark a mid-text
shift in gender. But this is interesting in itself, because a question
of the computer languages limitations led to a question about our own
categorizations. A difficulty with computation points to the
complexity of gender ontology. So TEI is useful for pointing out the
assumption that gender is a stable category.
