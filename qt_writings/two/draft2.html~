<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Literary and textual scholars have long speculated about Wilde's
intentions for revising the homoerotic content of his famous novel, <i>The
Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1891). More recently, electronic editing
standards enable scholars to explore textual composition histories
within a digital space. This project uses the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) method, an electronic editing tool that allows researchers to
‘mark up', or tag, textual elements. Using the TEI, I mark up the first
chapter of Wilde's manuscript of <i>Dorian Gray</i>, which introduces the
story's three main characters, Basil Hallward, Lord Henry Wotten, and
Dorian Gray. Drawing from debates in Textual Scholarship and Queer
Historiography, I question how electronic editing with the TEI might
register or ‘rescue' the queer affects of this text. My work here pushes
against what I identify as TEI's main constraint, which is its
limitation for handling data that is discrete, rather than smooth or
ambiguous data, like the homoeroticism of this text. I conclude by
proposing a TEI customization that marks Wilde's revisions according to
the four affects of ‘intimacy', ‘beauty', ‘passion' and ‘fatality'. As
an experiment in ‘queer encoding', this customization shows the limits
of the strict data structure of the TEI for engaging the fluidity and
complexity of queerness in the text.

<h3 id="org70b0ca8"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
In the first scene of the novel, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1891),
the painter Basil Hallward confesses to his friend Lord Henry Wotton
why he cannot exhibit the portrait of the eponymous hero. Basil
admits, "Where there is merely love, they would see something evil,
where there is spectacular passion, they would suggest something vile"
(Wilde 21). By "merely love" and "spectacular passion," does Basil
mean a kind of love and passion that is divorced from homosexuality?
Or does he mean there is nothing "evil" or "vile" about this kind of
love and passion? Regardless of Basil's meaning, this striking line,
among many others that carry homoerotic innuendos, never appears in
print. It is excised during Oscar Wilde's revision process, along with
similar suggestions of homoeroticism between the three main characters
of the story.
</p>

<p>
The textual scholarship on this revision process generally agrees that
Wilde neutralizes Basil's erotic fascination with Dorian by
transforming it into aesthetic appreciation. Sidestepping romance for
beauty, and the text is more likely to get by the censors. With
homosexuality obscured to a cipher, Wilde can complicate matters with
aesthetic principles like, "To reveal art and conceal the artist is
art's aim," as stated in the "Preface" to the published book
version. One critic, Nicolas Ruddick explains that this revision
process creates a double moral to the text. According to Ruddick,
Wilde aestheticizes Dorian in order to emphasize a moral about the
dangers of vanity at the expense of another, more covert moral about
the liberalization of homosexuality. While the moral about vanity
"dramatize[s] the disastrous consequences of the preference of the
beautiful at the expense of the good," the other moral about
homosexuality "explores the destructive effects of the clandestine or
closeted life" (Ruddick 126, 128). The novel's famous portrait indexes
the convergence of these two morals: "the appalling changes to
Dorian's painted image &#x2026; strongly suggest that the unspeakable
practices indulged in by the protagonist are unspeakable in
themselves" (Ruddick 129).
</p>

<p>
The question of "unspeakability" is the topic of this chapter. This
project begun as as exploration of homosexuality's unspeakability, and
how one might discover and describe it using digital tools that enable
one to mark up Wilde's revisions of the homoerotic elements. To do
this work, I used an electronic editing tool called the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI, explained further below) that enables me to register
and describe Wilde's revisions according to themes like "passion,"
"beauty," "intimacy," and "fatality." But what begun as a markup
project eventually expanded into an interrogation of the data format
itself, the rigid, hierarchical structure of the TEI. I found that
this data format works best with material that is discrete and
bounded, rather than smooth or blended, like the queer themes of the
text. I created a custom TEI schema that tags homoerotic elements in a
way that surfaces their elusiveness. As a labeling tool, the TEI
reveals moments of plurality and permeability, when themes like
"intimacy" and "fatality" threaten the bounds of the rigid data
structure. As my thinking developed, I found the problem with TEI goes
deeper than containerization. This custom tool, and the ways in which
it <i>didn't</i> work, enabled me to think productively about the
totalizing nature of hierarchical power structures. In what follows, I
suggest that, underlying Ruddick's two morals about beauty and
homosexuality, there is a third level of "unspeakability," this one
about power, about who has it and who is subject to it.

My project uses the TEI markup not only to examine the nature of
Wilde's revisions, but also the potential for technological tools to
engage queerness in textual data. In doing so, it endeavors to answer
a question that provokes the emerging field of <i>Queer Digital
Humanities</i>, or Queer DH. As literary and electronic textual scholar
Julia Flanders asks: "do we need to queer markup, or is markup already
queerable?" (2017). Flanders's question considers the TEI's place
between two current approaches in Queer DH: the first approach wants
to disrupt formal systems by imagining alternative ones, and the
second, by contrast, maintains that queerness is built into computing
and is inherent in computational logic. In an attempt to cut between
these debates, this project first searches for a structural constraint
within the TEI format, and then works through this constraint to
analyze the homoerotic elements in Wilde's manuscript revisions. As
such, this project aligns with another that uses the TEI to
destabilize our current understanding of Wilde's textual and
historical legacy. Jason A. Boyd's <i>Texting Wilde Project</i> uses the
TEI to mark up the biographical information, particularly references
to persons, places, and events, in writings about Wilde's life. Its
goal is to reveal the historical discrepencies and inaccuracies across
Wilde's biography. Boyd points out that "Our knowledge of 'Oscar
Wilde' is not comprised of a corpus of pure and simple facts that
allows us an unmediated apprehension of a real person separated from
us by only time, but rather this knowledge is comprised of a densely
complex and often contradictory accretion of texts" (Boyd para. 1).
</p>

<p>
Similar to Boyd, my project also uses the TEI to complicate the
understanding of Wilde's textual legacy. It identifies one major
constraint of the TEI: that it works best with data that is discrete,
rather than smooth data, like the homoeroticism obscured by Wilde's
pen. Here, I apply the rigid constraint of the TEI data structure
towards marking up and analyzing this text's homoeroticism, which I
group into the general themes of "intimacy," "beauty," "passion," and
"fatality," as well as the pen strokes that Wilde used to strike these
elements from the text. The functionality of the TEI as a tool that
bounds and labels data into discrete elements allows me to explore the
indeterminate boundaries of these queer themes in the text. The strict
nature of this tool also suggests, on a deeper level, how dominance
structures work to implicitly determine and delimit information.

To inform my approach for handling homoerotic subject matter within
digital contexts, I bring Textual Scholarship and Queer Studies, into
conversation. The debates within these fields allow me to carve out a
methodology for digitizing what electronic editing scholar Jerome
McGann calls our "textual inheritance" (McGann, 2001: xi). Between
these two fields, I identify a parallel debate between what I term the
"restorative" and "productive" approaches to critical analysis. 
</p>

<p>
The history of Textual Scholarship first tends toward the restorative
approach, beginning with the work of Shakepearean scholar Ronald
B. McKerrow, who maintains that the goal of scholarly editing is to
preserve authorial intention. McKerrow's influential model for
"copy-text" editing, which establishes the base-text for editing on an
early witness that most closely resembles the author's original
intention, eventually gives way to Walter W. Greg's approach that
expands the purview of critics to more than a single
witness. Subsequently, textual scholars like Fredson Bowers and Thomas
Tanselle advance Greg's work, proposing the "eclectic edition" as the
format that enables the editor to distil authorial intention from
multiple sources.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Tanselle in particular takes this principle to
its logical conclusion, arguing that the "work" exists in an ideal
form, beyond the reach of physical corruption:
physical corruption: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of it
are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in
sound waves &#x2026; its medium is neither visual nor auditory. The medium of
literature is the words (whether already existent or newly created) of a
language; and arrangements of words according to the syntax of some
language (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses or
punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are reported by
voice or in writing. (Tanselle, 1989: 16&#x2013;17)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tanselle's position enshrines the editor as the only figure capable of
realizing the "work" in its ideal form. Because the act of inscription
involves physical tools that can corrupt this ideal form, the writer
requires an editor whose distance from the creation of the work
enables his objective evaluation of its intention. Tanselle's quite
radical view for preserving authorial intention exemplifies the
extreme of the restorative approach.
</p>

<p>
If the restorative approach promotes editorial practices that
increasingly consign the role of the editor as a recoverer or
preserver of texts, the productive approach empowers the editor as an
enabler of potential textual readings. Toward the end of the 20th
century, textual scholar D. F. McKenzie's ideas about "the sociology
of texts" were the first to widely challenge the claim that a single
text can represent an "ideal" version, that is, authorial
intention. According to McKenzie, the text is never one single object
but stems from a number of human agencies and mechanical techniques
that are historically situated; he points out that, "Every society
rewrites its past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have
any continuing life at all, at some point every printer redesigns
them" (McKenzie 25). Jerome McGann expands this sociological
perspective into digital editing environments, where electronic
formats create opportunities for presenting textual variation. McGann
explains that textual criticism in print format is limited because a
print text must conform to the linear and two-dimensional form of the
codex&#x2013;the same form as its object of study. Digital editions, by
contrast, can be designed for complex, reflexive, and ongoing
interactions between reader and text. McGann notes that his work on
the digital <i>Rossetti Archive</i> brought him to repeatedly reconsider
his earlier conception and goals, explaining that the archive "seemed
more and more an instrument for imagining what we didn't know" (McGann
82). McGann's approach counters the traditional fidelity toward
authorial intention with a drive to harness the potentiality of
textual variation. The transformation of literary material into
electronic format becomes a vehicle for a critical analytical method
that McGann and Lisa Samuels call "deformative criticism," which works
by distorting, disordering, or re-assembling literary material in
order to estrange the reader from their familiarity of the
text. Continually subscribing the text to new configurations, this
estrangement confronts the reader with new insights about its formal
significance and meaning.
</p>

<p>
For that reason, deformative criticism encourages a productive
approach to editing.

My work encoding Wilde's revisions to the manuscript plays against the
long-standing "recovery" project about Wilde's intentions as he
revises <i>Dorian Gray</i> into the periodical and book versions. Textual
scholars like Donald Lawler, Joseph Bristow and Nicolas Ruddick claim
that Wilde's revisions work toward the overall goal of aestheticizing
the text. This project of aestheticization begins in the manuscript
which is eventually published, in periodical form, in <i>Lippincott's
Monthly Magazine</i> on June 20, 1890.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> This first printing of ‘The
Picture of Dorian Gray', which spans 98 pages over 13 chapters, was
widely criticized in the press for its seemingly ambiguous stance on
an immoral protagonist. Bristow explains that ‘[Wilde's] narrative
struck the [reviewers] as a work that appeared “corrupt”, displayed
“effeminate frivolity”, and dealt “with matters only fitted for the
Criminal Investigation Department”' (2000: xviii). Wilde spends the
next several days defending his work in letters to the editors,
entering into a public correspondence with them.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> A few months
later, in the early spring of 1891, Wilde publishes a ‘Preface' that
makes such claims as ‘Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things
are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault' and ‘To reveal
art and conceal the artist is art's aim'.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Scholar Barbara
Lecklie asserts that, by these complex and incisive statements,
‘Wilde's strategy is to refocus on art and disparage the focus on the
reader by saying that the reader is the one who makes a work immoral'
(2013: 173). Similarly, Lawler argues that ‘the “Preface” &#x2026; hold[s]
up aesthetic beauty and artistic effect as the only legitimate
criteria of critical evaluation' (1988: 16). The ‘Preface' is included
in the subsequent iteration of <i>Dorian Gray</i>, published in a book
version by Ward, Lock &amp; Company in April 1891. According to the editor
of the <i>Uncensored Edition</i> of <i>Dorian Gray</i>, Victor Frankel, Wilde
here makes significant deletions of passages referencing
homosexuality, promiscuous or illicit heterosexuality, and ‘anything
that smacked generally of decadence' (2011: 47&#x2013;48). Wilde also
‘heighten[s] Dorian's monstrosity toward the novel's conclusion' to
bring the story ‘to a moral conclusion that he thought would silence
his critics' (Frankel, 2011:30).
</p>

<p>
Like Textual Scholarship, the field of Queer Studies has also engaged
in debates about methodologies for recovery. In the subfield of Queer
Historiography, which Susan McCabe describes as the "critical trend of
locating 'identifications' (rather than identity), modes of being and
having, in historical contexts," there is a debate about the extent to
which critics in the present can adequately define queerness in the
past (McCabe 120). The Queer Historicist position advocated by
scholars like David Halperin and Valerie Traub maintain that
homosexuality is historically constructed, that "queerness" means
something different today than it did in the past, and that scholars
can get at its meaning by employing a Foucauldian genealogical method
that traces its meaning over time. Identity based on sexuality,
according to Halperin, is a modern cultural production: "no single
category of discourse or experience existed in the premodern and
non-Western worlds that comprehended exactly the same range of
same-sex sexual behaviors &#x2026; that now fall within the capacious
definitional boundaries of homosexuality" (Halperin 88). Evoking
Judith Butler's famous description on the word "queer" as "never fully
owned, but always and only redeployed, twisted, queered from a prior
usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political
purposes," Valerie Traub explains that the utility of the word "queer"
as a descriptive term relies on historical specificity (173):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Queer's free-floating, endlessly mobile, and infinitely subversive
capacities may be strengths&#x2014;allowing queer to accomplish strategic
maneuvers that no other concept does&#x2014;but its principled imprecision
implies analytic limitations &#x2026; if queer is intelligible only in
relation to its social norms, and if the concept of normality itself
is of relatively recent vintage (Locherie), then the relations between
queer and the changing configurations of gender and sexuality need to
be defined and redefined. Traub 33
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When "queer" is applied ahistorically, it loses its descriptive
value. According to this historicist position, homosexuality, in order
to be legible, necessitates historical specificity.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the "unhistoricists" are wary of demarcating queer
identity and identification across history. These scholars, who
include Jonathan Goldberg, Madhavi Menon, and Heather Love, maintain
that the attempt to define "queer" implicitly subscribes queerness to
a logic of progress, a heteronormative teleology. Historicizing
queerness has the effect of normalizing queerness, according to
Goldberg and Menon: "to produce queerness as an object of our scrutiny
would mean the end of queering itself" (1609, 1608). Within this view,
Heather Love offers an opportunity for continuing the project of queer
history. Her methodology takes negative affects like shame, anger,
disgust, hatred, disappointment as part of an accounting of "the
social, psychic, and corporeal effects of homophobia" (2). This
method, which she calls "feeling backward," takes negative affects and
histories without attempting to "fix" them into contemporary
conceptions of identity and desire. Rather, Love is interested in
exploring the way that subjects turn away or refuse the critic's
attempt to "redeem" or "rescue" them. To illustrate this process of
"feeling backward," she offers the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice,
pointing out that Orpheus <i>prefers</i> to behold Eurydice in the darkness
of the Underworld rather than in the sunlight, which would transform
her into something fully accessible and therefore less
desirable.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> Love, who asserts that "Queer history has been an
education in absence" (52), points out that "[Eurydice's] specific
attraction for queer subjects is an effect&#x2026; of a historical
experience of love as bound up with loss. To recognize Eurydice as
desirable in her turn away is a way of identifying through that loss"
(51). 
</p>

<p>
Across Textual Scholarship and Queer Studies, there are two parallel
methodologies for addressing the problem of what to do with the
past. On the restorative side, the impulse to recover authorial
intention resembles the drive to historicize queer
identification. Both are motivated by a notion that the past is
accessible to the discerning critic. On the productive side,
deformative criticism plays on the same creative instinct as "feeling
backward." Love describes this work as "a mode of historiography that
recognizes the inevitability of a 'play of recognitions' but that also
sees these recognitions not as consoling but as shattering" (Love,
2009: 45). In this "play of recognitions," which describes the
critic's "search for roots and resemblances" within queer subject
matter, I want to emphasize the word "play" (45). The impossibility of
recovering the past enables the critic to experiment with alternative
methods of analysis. For Love, accepting queerness as something that
eludes containment compels her to explore how queerness escapes
knowability. I propose that this method of attending to elusive
affects, without trying to transform them into something more
palatable, can apply to digital contexts and toward productive
ends. One may, borrowing from McGann and Samuel's idea of deformance,
reconceive textual editing as a formal experiment. The TEI can be used
to explore how electronic editing tools impose new formal structures
on queer subject matter. This allows one to take the attempt at
recovery and, rather than aim for resolution, multiply the potential
readings of textual elements. Using the TEI in this way allows
researchers to direct ‘queer encoding' practices toward enacting what
Kadji Amin, Amber Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez describe as ‘queer
form', or ‘the range of formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies
that make difference a little less knowable, visible, and digestible'
(2017: 235).
</p>

<p>
An examination of queer form in this text will reveal the ways in
which power is more deeply entrenched than I had anticipated. To
better understand the workings of power in data structures, it is
useful to examine the historiographical work on arguably one of the
most precarious datasets in history—-the archive of slavery. Like
Heather Love, scholar Hartman seeks to recuperate (without recovering)
the lives of these subjects. But unlike Love, Hartman's subjects are
constituted in history by their absence in the archive. She explains
that this is a double erasure&#x2014;not only does the archive omits or
obscure information, but it also employs a language that cannot
approximate experience (Hartman 2). A condition she describes as the
"violence of the archive," Hartman explains the archive only records
the subject in the terms of their objectification, in "a display of
the violated body, an inventory of property" (2). Hartman's goal is to
write about these subjects in a way that does not do more damage, but
draws attention to the ways that their lives have been delineated
while inviting possibility for living. For doing so, she proposes a
method of "critical fabulation" (11). Like "deformance" and "feeling
backward," "critical fabulation" plays on imagination and
experimentation. Due to the death and violence that constitutes this
archive, however, the stakes are higher. Hartman poses a question
which haunts all historiographical work: "How does one revisit the
scene of subjection without replicating the grammar of violence?” (4).

Created specifically for working with literary material, the TEI
enables researchers to describe, transcribe and edit print text or
manuscripts in electronic format. The TEI enables users to "mark up"
aspects of literary texts that they think are important, such as
structural elements (chapters, paragraphs, line breaks), physical
details about the text (revisions, illegible text) or conceptual
elements (persons, geographical locations). To mark up these elements,
encoders use "tags." such as <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> to indicate a line of text,
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> to indicate deleted text, and <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> for a reference to a
person. Below is an image of Mary Shelley's manuscript of
<i>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</i> (1818) and its diplomatic
transcription (see Figure 1). Beneath them is an excerpt of the
underlying TEI code, created by the researchers at the Shelley-Godwin
Archive.

<p>
In the encoding, the <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags indicate lines of text, and <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>
tags indicate deleted text. Through this level of detail, TEI
facilitates deep and complex description of textual material that
facilitates scholarly research. This excerpt also includes a
<code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> tag and <code>@hand</code> attribute, which indicate whose ‘hand' is
responsible for writing each section of text: a valuable piece of
information for a text co-edited by Shelley's husband, Percy Shelley.
</p>

<p>
TEI documents resemble an ordered hierarchy containing a nested tree
structure, with one ‘root' component and several ‘branches', known as
‘nodes'. The TEI requires all elements in the text to be contained as
discrete nodes within this bounded structure, and elements cannot
overlap unless the inner element is fully nested within an outer
element. Though the strict tagging structure of the TEI forces encoders
to organize textual elements as discrete, ordered data, it also enables
them to create their own labels for the elements. Perhaps the most
useful aspect about the TEI is this customizability, which it inherits
from its parent language, eXtensible Markup Language (XML). As an
‘extensible' language, TEI users can create their own tags to describe
the particular elements they wish to encode. <i>The Women Writers Project
(WWP)</i>, directed by Julia Flanders, adequately frames how TEI's inherent
extensibility can address textual ambiguity. According to the <i>WWP</i>:
</p>

<p>
Unlike many standardization efforts, the TEI &#x2026; explicitly
accommodat[es] variation and debate within its technical
framework. The TEI Guidelines are designed to be both modular and
customizable, so that specific projects can choose the relevant
portions of the TEI and ignore the rest, and can also if necessary
create extensions of the TEI language to describe facets of the text
which the TEI does not yet address. (Flanders, 1999&#x2013;2021)
</p>

<p>
Because TEI is built from a language that allows its users to build
their own version of that language, there is potential for representing
the elements necessary for a project by customizing these elements on a
project-by-project basis.
</p>

<p>
As queer studies scholars may know, however, some textual elements will
resist containment within any kind of category. Accordingly, there are a
number of projects that explore the potential of the TEI for ‘queer
encoding', such as the encoding of queer gender. The <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> tag,
which describes persons referenced within a text, is limited to one
value for gender, which creates obstacles for scholars working to encode
multiple or diverse sexual identities. Pamela Caughie and Sabine Meyer,
for example, use the the TEI to encode <i>Man Into Woman</i>, the life
narrative of Danish painter Lili Elbe, who undertook one of the first
gender affirming surgeries in 1930. The attempt to mark up Elbe's
complex gender ontology brings Caughie and Meyer against this structural
limitation of the TEI:
</p>

<p>
[T]he deeper we got into mark-up, the more evident it became that the
categories and hierarchies available to us were inadequate for our
task&#x2026; to identify a male subject who at times presents himself as
masquerading as a woman, at others as being inhabited by one, and who
eventually becomes a woman, in a life history narrated retrospectively
from the perspective of Lili Elbe. (Caughie and Meyer, 2018: 231)
</p>

<p>
The TEI forces these scholars to consider the ways that computation
works on a deeper level to reify gender as essential. In particular, the
fixity that the TEI imposes upon Elbe as a queer subject brings out the
ways that gender is situated and relational across this text.
</p>

<p>
Other scholars find advantage in the TEI's strict data
structure. While the TEI limits what constitutes a person&#x2014;as an
entity with one sex, for example&#x2014;it also enables an approach toward
personhood as multiple.  Like Caughie and Meyer, Marion Thain also
works to encode the diaries of a complex writing subject: the late
19th-century English poet, Michael Field. Michael Field is a pen name
for the lesbian couple, Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, which
signifies ‘the assumed names of two separate women, as well as
appearing to signify one single male identity' (Thain, 2016:
228). Fortunately for Thain, the TEI enables the encoding of distinct
identities, which is central for understanding the queerness of the
diaries:
</p>

<p>
[T]he proliferation and slipperiness of names is no mere childish
caprice but a core part of the articulation of queer: an unhinging of
‘given' or apparently predetermined identity through a strategy that
articulates identity as constantly shifting, constructed, and
performative. Text encoding can, in a simple but powerful way, help us
explore and map this crucial strand of queer identity construction
across the diary. (Thain, 2016: 233)
</p>

<p>
Thain's approach harnesses the hierarchical nature of the TEI to list
the various references to each personage within the <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> tag.
This <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> tag allows Thain to ‘render searchable words not in
the text but intimately tied to it. This is not a small issue in a
diary in which Katharine Bradley herself is referred to by more than
20 different names' (Thain, 2016: 233). By enabling Thain to encode
multiple names for each writer of the text, the TEI data structure
enables Thain to manage the problem of queer identity in this text.
</p>

<p>
Why do Caughie and Meyer struggle to encode Elbe's identity while
Thain appears to succeed with Fields'? While a queerness like Fields'
might be delineated and contained, in Elbe's there is a quality of
blending which the markup, by its nature, means to separate and
fix. As Flanders points out, markup is a tool for naming, bounding,
and containment, and therefore registers information in distinct
components (Flanders, 2017). Fields' identity is multiple yet
distinct: the diaries proffer ‘two different hands [that] record the
experience of two clearly differentiated people' (Thain, 2016:
229). By contrast, Elbe's identity is plural, containing several
identities whose relationship to each other is ambiguous or
continually shifting within one entity.  Elbe's relation to gender is
best described qualitatively, as one that alternatively ‘masquerades'
or ‘inhabits' simultaneous gender ontologies (Caughie and Meyer, 2018:
231).

<p>
For Wilde's text in particular, I created a customization that
explores the potential of semantic labelling against the demands for
fixity and structure within the TEI schema. My customization registers
physical and conceptual changes to the manuscript by creating two new
attributes to mark the revisions. First, to mark the physical traces
of Wilde's pen as he struck out portions of the text, the custom
attribute, ‘strokes' (<code>@strokes</code> in formal TEI notation), registers
the number of pen strokes through any given section of text.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
Most often, Wilde uses one or two strokes of his pen, although
sometimes, the strokes are too heavy or thick to enumerate. In those
cases, I set the <code>@strokes</code> attribute to the value ‘inconclusive'. In
addition to <code>@strokes</code>, the custom attribute <code>@implication</code> marks the
general theme of revision from a list of recurring themes, which
include: ‘intimacy', ‘beauty', ‘passion', and ‘fatality', with the
additional values of ‘inconclusive' or ‘illegible'.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, I detail how this customization registers the elisions
of homoeroticism in the manuscript as Wilde prepared it for publication.
The goal of this work is not to establish a formal method for marking
queer elements, rather, it is to surface a resistance in the text: an
indeterminacy that resists capture by the TEI data structure. Here, the
difficulty is in engaging the boundedness of the TEI elements, which
encapsulate data, with the indistinctiveness of the queerness of the
text, which resist demarcation. The four themes of ‘intimacy', ‘beauty',
‘passion', and ‘fatality' constitute a spectrum of smooth information
that threatens the confines of the TEI tags. To add another layer of
ambiguity, the number of pen strokes also resists easy demarcation: they
can be difficult to enumerate and their boundaries often fail to map
with the themes. Therefore, in order to mark up this text, I impose
decisions on the data.
</p>

<p>
The evocative opening scene, which consists of a lively dialogue between
Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton, sets the tone, reveals character
dynamics, and lays out some of the conflict for the ensuing story. In
these first few pages, Basil appears to be a sympathetic, sensitive,
albeit slightly exasperated artist, who confides in his close friend
Lord Henry the powerful influence that Dorian Gray has had upon his life
and work. Lord Henry, by contrast, appears as an affable and witty
gentleman aesthete, who counters Basil's sincerity with offbeat
observations and paradoxical aphorisms. From the revisions made to this
opening scene, a few general patterns emerge. First, the revisions work
to stifle the emotional tension and physical affection in the dialogue
between Basil and Lord Henry, replacing it with a lighter or more
neutral tone. Because these revisions generally shore up the friendship
between Basil and Lord Henry, conveying fondness in their rapport, they
are encoded according to the theme of ‘intimacy'. Second are the themes
of ‘beauty' and ‘passion', which mostly concern revisions where Dorian
is reformulated from a romantic object into an artistic subject for
Basil's painting. Third, and finally, is the theme of ‘fatality', which
emerges in moments where Basil struggles to explain the consuming and
self-destructive effects of Dorian's influence on his life.
</p>

<p>
On the theme of intimacy, Wilde's pen slashes through evidence of
physical contact between Basil, Lord Henry, and Dorian. This includes
the following: ‘taking hold of his [Lord Henry's] hand' (9), Dorian's
‘cheek just brushed my [Basil's] cheek' (20), Basil and Dorian ‘sit
beside each other' (22). Additionally, the dialogue between Basil and
Lord Henry develops intimacy through their tone and subtle mannerisms,
which facilitates Basil's confession of his feelings for Dorian. In some
cases, Wilde diminishes this intimacy in their conversation with the
effect of mitigating the sense of foreboding that surrounds Basil's
attraction to Dorian. Here, Wilde replaces tense pauses with laughter or
exchanges dramatic statements and descriptions with more playful ones.
One such example occurs when Basil struggles to convey his reasoning for
refusing to exhibit Dorian's portrait:
</p>

<p>
‘The reason why I will not exhibit this picture, is that I am afraid
that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Henry hesitated for a moment. ‘And what is that?' he asked, in a
low voice. ‘I will tell you,' said Hallward, and a look of pain came
over his face. ‘Don't if you would rather not,' murmured his companion,
looking at him. (9)
</p>

<p>
The revised version in the manuscript, incorporating the deletions and
interlinear additions, reads:
</p>

<p>
‘The reason why I will not exhibit this picture, is that I am afraid
that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Henry laughed. ‘And what is that?' he asked. ‘I will tell you,'
said Hallward, and an expression of perplexity came over his face. ‘I am
all expectation Basil,' murmured his companion, looking at him. (9)
</p>

<p>
Here, several changes mitigate the emotions of the scene. First, rather
than ‘hesitate', Lord Henry ‘laugh[s]', and he no longer speaks ‘in a
low voice'. The effect is to overwrite a previously intimate moment with
levity. Basil also exchanges his facial expression from one of agony to
confusion when ‘a look of pain' transforms into ‘an expression of
perplexity'. Lastly, Lord Henry, rather than sympathizing with Basil or
excusing his obligation to explain himself, instead encourages him to
speak: ‘I am all expectation, Basil'. Together, these changes work to
obscure Basil's internal suffering with the effect of lightening the
mood of the scene.
</p>

<p>
Another example similarly tempers the intense, emotional energy while
also mitigating a sense of anxiety or foreboding. It occurs on the
following page, where Basil is on the verge of revealing the reasons
behind his attraction to Dorian. The original dialogue proceeds: ‘Lord
Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and he
heard his own breath, with a sense almost of fear. “Yes. There is very
little to tell you,” whispered Hallward, “and I am afraid you will be
disappointed. Two months ago&#x2026;”' (10). The manuscript's revised version
reads: ‘Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart
beating, and he wondered what was coming. “Yes. There is very little to
tell you,” whispered Hallward rather bitterly, ‘and I dare say you will
be disappointed. Two months ago&#x2026;”' (10). Here, rather than draw
attention to Lord Henry's breathing, Wilde mentions Lord Henry's
‘wonder' about Basil's pending explanation, which shifts Lord Henry's
sense of anticipation from fear to curiosity. Wilde also makes slight
changes to Basil's delivery: in the revised version, Basil speaks
‘rather bitterly' and uses the expression ‘I dare say' rather than ‘I am
afraid'. Both changes diminish the confessional tone that originally
precedes Basil's revelation about Dorian Gray. In this change, and in
the aforementioned passage, the close rapport, the ‘intimacy', between
Basil and Lord Henry enables Basil's confession about the self-consuming
qualities of his feelings for Dorian, which suggests a connection to the
theme of ‘fatality'. The data structure of the TEI, however, fails to
capture this complicated dynamic because the <code>@implication</code> attribute is
limited to one value. Therefore, the encoder must choose one theme per
item of revision, either ‘intimacy' or ‘fatality'.
</p>

<p>
Throughout this chapter, Wilde often swaps out words with the effect of
diluting or diverting their original connotation. He focuses this type
of revision on Basil's dialogue, when Basil speaks about his passionate
attachment to Dorian and the effect of Dorian's beauty upon his art.
Here, Wilde trades expressive nouns with words that convey relatively
weaker or more generalized ideas. For example, in the sentence ‘Every
portrait that is painted with passion is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter', Wilde replaces ‘passion' with ‘feeling' in the
manuscript (9), exchanging the romantic connotation of ‘passion' with
the more neutral one of ‘feeling'. Additionally, on the theme of
‘passion', Wilde substitutes words and phrases which connote a strong
sense of romantic passion for ones that instead suggest an aesthetic
interest. One line, prior to revision, reads: ‘I knew that I had &#x2026;
come across someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that it
would be Lord over my life, my soul, my art itself' (11). Wilde revises
this line to: ‘I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose
mere personality was so fascinating that it would absorb my nature, my
soul, my art itself' (11). Here, Wilde swaps out ‘life' for ‘nature',
with the effect of subscribing Dorian's influence to his ‘nature', that
is, part of his personality or behavior, rather than encompassing his
‘life'. Wilde also replaces ‘be Lord over' with ‘absorb', which
maintains Basil's sense of submission to an external force without the
patriarchal designation in ‘Lord'. These changes, which are encoded
under the theme of ‘passion', diffuse a consuming quality in Basil's
attraction into a sensitivity to Dorian's aesthetic influence. Like the
revisions to the theme of ‘intimacy', the subtle changes of word choice
in this section also begin to gesture to the theme of fatality, which
fully develops over the next several pages.
</p>

<p>
In addition to words associated with ‘passion', Wilde often replaces the
word ‘beauty' in Basil's references to Dorian. In doing so, Wilde
neutralizes the power of Dorian's physical allure. For example, Wilde
changes ‘Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose
<i>beauty</i> had so stirred me' to ‘Suddenly I found myself face to face
with the young man whose <i>personality</i> had so strangely stirred me' (13,
my emphasis). The replacement of ‘beauty' with ‘personality' allows
Basil to avoid mentioning Dorian's physical appearance, and the addition
of ‘strangely' serves to mystify Dorian's influence over Basil.
Throughout the rest of chapter, Wilde makes several changes that
similarly dilute Dorian's powerful appearance: he replaces ‘beauty' with
‘good looks' and then with ‘face' two separate times (6, 18). Finally,
in reference to Dorian Gray, the word ‘Narcissus' is replaced with ‘man'
(13). Like the previous changes on the theme of ‘passion', the changes
in words associated with ‘beauty' shift the original connotation. Here,
the decision to replace ‘beauty' with references to ‘face' or ‘good
looks' maintains the emphasis on the physical while muting the
suggestive power of ‘beauty' in the abstract. In doing so, connotations
about the ideal, the charming, and the alluring, which usually accompany
descriptions of beauty, are diffused into physical description. This
evacuates Dorian's mysterious allure and diminishes the overwhelming
influence that he holds over Basil.
</p>

<p>
Removing associations with beauty and passion is part of Wilde's larger
effort of aestheticizing Dorian, transforming him from an erotic object
into an aesthetic object. At the end of the first chapter, Basil
implores Lord Henry to refrain from influencing the impressionable
youth. The original version reads:
</p>

<p>
‘Don't take away from me the one person that makes life lovely for me.
Mind, Harry, I trust you.' He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed
wrung out of him, almost against his will.
</p>

<p>
‘I don't suppose I shall care for him, and I am quite sure he won't care
for me,' replied Lord Henry smiling, and he took Hallward by the arm,
and almost led him into the house. (27&#x2013;28)
</p>

<p>
Lord Henry's assurance that neither he nor Dorian shall ‘care for' each
other characterizes Basil's passionate feelings for Dorian as a kind of
general possessiveness. However, the source of Basil's anxiety is
specified with the next revision:
</p>

<p>
‘Don't take away from me the one person that makes life absolutely
lovely to me, and that gives my art whatever wonder or charm it
possesses. Mind. Harry, I trust you.' He spoke very slowly, and the
words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.
</p>

<p>
‘What nonsense you talk,' said Lord Henry smiling, and, taking Hallward
by the arm, he almost led him to the house. (27, 27B)
</p>

<p>
In this revision, Basil attributes an aesthetic value to Dorian,
asserting Dorian's importance for his art, giving it ‘whatever wonder or
charm it possesses'. Lord Henry's response moves from reassurance to
dismissal, rejecting Basil's anxiety as ‘nonsense' and ending the scene
on a slightly humorous note. Across these changes, Wilde refocuses
Basil's jealous passion into an anxiety about losing Dorian as an
artistic subject. Additionally, the shift from sincere reassurance to
light-hearted repartee in Lord Henry's response evacuates the strong
emotional tone of the scene, replacing it with friendly banter. The
effect is to divert Basil's passion for Dorian toward aesthetic
appreciation.
</p>

<p>
Wilde's efforts in redirecting Basil's passion toward artistic ends is
inextricable from the attempts to soften Basil's intense and consuming
devotion to Dorian, which emerges in references to Basil's troubled
state of mind. One example occurs when Basil recounts his first time
meeting Dorian: ‘I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me
exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to him, I
would never leave him till either he or I were dead. I grew afraid, and
turned to quit the room' (12). Here, Basil's passion swells with an
intense, life-threatening quality that Wilde's pen works to mitigate by
removing the association with death. He crosses through ‘never leave him
till either he or I were dead' and adds ‘become absolutely devoted to
him, and that I ought not to speak to him'. Wilde again tempers this
self-consuming quality of Basil's devotion when he changes the phrase ‘I
could not live if I did not see him every day' to ‘I couldn't be happy
if I didn't see him every day' (17). By shifting the focus from Basil's
‘life' to his happiness, Wilde dilutes the profound peril that Basil's
passion has generated.
</p>

<p>
The TEI data structure reinforces the difficulty of disambiguating the
revisions within the themes of passion and fatality. In the phrase
discussed above, ‘look of pain' is revised to ‘an expression of
perplexity' (see Figures 2 and 3). Working with this revision in the TEI
presents two points of contention (see Figure 2). First, in
categorizing the theme, does the phrase ‘look of pain' express passion
or fatality? On the one hand, ‘pain' denotes a strong, passionate
feeling; on the other, Basil often draws on pain in his references to
the fatalistic qualities about his attraction to Dorian, as in the
following quote which was deleted: ‘I feel, Harry, that I have given
away my whole soul to someone seems to take a real delight in giving me
pain' (23). The difficulty of disambiguating the theme is mirrored by
the strokes of Wilde's pen, which vary even across the same phrase:
while the word ‘look' is struck so heavily that the number of strokes is
inconclusive, the word ‘pain' contains a single stroke. With the TEI, it
is impossible to mark the variations in strokes without separating the
single revision into two instances, which would break up the integrity
of the phrase. Therefore, it is marked with the value ‘inconclusive'.
The ambiguity in the number of strokes also deepens when considering the
semantics of the revision: the heavier strokes are focused on a revision
(‘look' to ‘expression') that carries less semantic weight than the
single stroke (‘pain' to ‘perplexity'). In this case, the labelling
fails to register even suggest the ways that different components are
interrelated. The reasoning behind the relationship between the themes
and the strokes remains recalcitrant.

</p>

<p>
My final example concerns a longer passage that was heavily revised in
the manuscript (see Figures 4 and 5). The treatment of this passage
crystallizes the various patterns of revision seen so
far&#x2014;diminishing signs of intimacy, passion, and references to
Basil's fatalism. The passage in the manuscript bears quoting in
full. Prior to any revisions, it reads:
</p>

<p>
‘You remember that landscape of mine&#x2026; It is one of the best things I
have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it,
Dorian Gray sat beside me, and as he leaned across to look at it, his
cheek just brushed my cheek. The world becomes young to me when I hold
his hand, as when I see him, the centuries yield up all their secrets!'
</p>

<p>
‘Basil, this is [illegible] you must not talk [illegible] [illegible]
his power, [indecipherable] to make yourself the [illegible] slave! It
is worse than wicked, it is silly. I hate Dorian Gray.'
</p>

<p>
Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the garden. A
curious smile curled his lips. He seemed like a man in a dream. After
some time he came back. ‘You don't understand, Harry&#x2026;' he said.
‘Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more present
in my work then when no image of him is there. He is simply a
suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the curves of
certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. That
is all.'
</p>

<p>
‘Then why won't you exhibit his picture?'
</p>

<p>
‘Because I have put into it the romance of which I have never dared to
speak to him. He knows nothing about it, but the world might guess it,
where there is merely love, they would see something evil, where there
is spectacular passion, they would suggest something vile.' (20&#x2013;21)
</p>

Figure 5:/MS/ page 21 from The Morgan Library and
Museum. 
</p>

<p>
The TEI surfaces Wilde's layers of revision in this passage (see
Figures 6 and 7). In the first paragraph, Wilde eliminates a span of
text from ‘and as he leaned' to ‘secrets!'. Within this span, Wilde
makes additional changes, adding text such as ‘hair just touched my
hand'. Due to its physical nature, this particular phrase is marked as
‘intimacy' in the TEI, while the longer section is enclosed by the
label of ‘passion', which denotes the nature of the other revisions
within the same sentence, like ‘The world becomes young to me when I
hold his hand'. Here, the TEI enables a layered approach to markup
where one element can be nested within another.

</p>

<p>
While the first paragraph is legible, the next one, by contrast, is
almost completely blotted out. It consists of Lord Henry's condemnatory
and jealous protestations: ‘his power', ‘to make yourself the &#x2026;
slave!' and ‘I hate Dorian Gray'. Here, Wilde obscures the fatalistic
connotations of Basil's passion, which exasperate Lord Henry.
Accordingly, the <code>@implication</code> is marked as ‘fatality' and the
<code>@strokes</code> are marked as ‘inconclusive'.
</p>

<p>
Most of the third paragraph is preserved, presumably for how it furthers
Dorian's aestheticization. Here, Basil elaborates upon Dorian's
aesthetic influence, which inspires his apprehension of the natural
world. In the following paragraph, however, Wilde again obscures much of
language, which revolves around the themes of passion and fatality. On
the theme of fatality, the small adjustment of ‘would' to ‘might'
eliminates a sense of inevitability about Basil's feelings for Dorian.
On the theme of passion, the revelatory line: ‘where there is merely
love, they would see something evil, where there is spectacular passion,
they would suggest something vile' is completely struck out. This
statement clarifies Dorian's importance for Basil as the source of a
powerful allure that suffuses Basil's art with beauty. Notably, the
strokes over the phrase ‘suggest something vile' are doubled, which
cannot be encoded in the TEI without separating the revision into two
instances. As with the deletion of ‘look of pain' (9), marking each
element here with precision would require separating into distinct
entities what is in fact one act of revision that contains plural
implications. It would involve resolving Wilde's perhaps indeterminate
motives into a single intention.
</p>

<p>
On one level, the TEI encoding reinforces the claim by Lawlor, Frankel,
and Bristow that Wilde diminishes the homoerotic elements by
transforming Dorian from an erotic into an aesthetic object. This goal
is achieved in three ways: first, by easing the tension surrounding his
dialogue with Lord Henry; second, by emphasizing Dorian as an ideal
subject for art; and finally, by removing the destructive connotations
of Basil's attachment to Dorian. On a deeper level, however, the
existing textual scholarship has yet to contend with the complex ways in
which Wilde's intentionality is distributed among the revisions. To
resolve some of the difficulty with encoding this text, one might employ
more precise qualitative markers such as ‘tension' in addition to
‘intimacy', or ‘ardor' and ‘devotion', in addition to ‘passion', for
example. But creating more tags would dilute the analytical utility of
the TEI encoding, which is meant not meant to be exhaustive. In this
project, the TEI reveals that the themes of intimacy, beauty, passion,
and fatality operate in intransigent or inscrutable ways: at times they
are plural, co-existing within a single line of text; more often, they
are inextricable, with one enabling the other, like intimacy and passion
which enable fatality; at other times, they enfold one within the other,
encompassing a plurality of intentions. The TEI, which requires strict
disambiguation, surfaces how these themes work together in ways that
cannot be captured by its data structure.

<p>
As Heather Love points out, queerness will be ‘always bound up with
loss' and the attempt to ‘rescue' or ‘recover' it will only lead to
inevitable failure (2009: 51). The TEI enables an approach toward
editing in this text that complicates, rather than resolves,
queerness. By encouraging encoders to impose a level of fixity on the
text, the TEI allows them to discover exactly where queerness eludes
containment. This computational constraint of the TEI is an <i>enabling</i>
one: by surfacing moments of failed disambiguation, the TEI reinforces
the encoder as the one who ascribes semantic value to Wilde's
revisions.  This failed disambiguation is also productive: the
practice of pinning something down only to realize that such
intelligibility is impossible.  The TEI has been productive precisely
because it requires the encoder to construct labels for textual
elements which, cannot be fully recovered.  Accordingly, this practice
in ‘queer encoding' does not attempt to resolve the question of
Wilde's revisions but tags the homoerotic elements in such a way that
allows them to retain some of their elusiveness. One may examine the
formalizations produced by this TEI schema not for what it reveals
about Wilde's intentions, but for how it releases potential readings
of the history of his composition, in other words, to mark and
visualize its <i>queer form</i>: the elusive affects, repressed desires,
and other coded elements of queerness within this text. The TEI
confronts one with precisely that which escapes existing structures
for knowing queerness, in order to suggest, without fully grasping,
its ever-shifting permutations.
