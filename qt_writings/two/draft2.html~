"Spend more time on these exciting questions around the limitations of
TEI, and on the topics in the last section and conclusion. Not much
space is given to the TEI approach the author is using in Wilde’s text
in comparison to the other sections, and what the author’s original
customisation of TEI achieves. I would suggest a reframing of the
article to focus more on how the tagging releases textual meanings
within this text in reference to Wilde’s revisions, how TEI offers new
methods to read these revisions and their potential forms, how the
themes that characterise the revisions operate and contribute to the
markup, and how this visualises queer form and its slippery affects or
coded elements within the text. The close attention to the varied
physical pen strokes and marks on the pages within Wilde’s revisions
and the parallels with the conceptual homoerotic elements of the edits
is highly interesting and would benefit from more exploration within
the article."

The referencing is inconsistent and there are multiple instances where
the author mentions specific work done by a scholar but does not
provide the full reference and these scholarly works do not appear in
the bibliography. Please see the Author Guideline’s for references and
how to format citations, which recommends the Harvard referencing
style.
</p>

<p>
There are also points where some references to critical work in the
field of DH and queer studies would benefit from expansion. I have
also added a few comments which I hope will be of use via track
changes to suggest more places where the author may wish to elaborate
or clarify points.

While the author’s central research question (Julia Flanders’ do we
need to queer markup or is markup already queerable?) is clear and
effectively explored, article would benefit from clearer illustration

Similarly, the author makes too much use of phrases such as “Now I

filler phrases and make the article feel over-signposted at

<p>
Textual scholars have long speculated over Wilde's intentions as he
wrote and revised his famous novel, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>
(1891). Among the more striking changes to the manuscript (MS) version
of the story is the suppression of homoeroticism between the three
main characters: the painter Basil Hallward, his subject Dorian Gray,
and their friend, Lord Henry Wotton. <del>Scholars-generally-posit-that

</p>


<p>
My project examines in detail Wilde's revisions to the manuscript's
homoerotic elements by using a digital tool that allows researchers to
mark and describe each change in the manuscript. I follow the
electronic editing standard called the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
to encode or "mark up" the changes that Wilde made on the first
chapter of this text. Text encoding with TEI (as explained further
below) allows researchers to isolate and describe in detail various
features of textual data, in my case, the deletions and additions that
Wilde made on his manuscript. In analyzing these changes, I draw from
debates in Textual Scholarship and Queer Historiography, which inform
my approach for handling homoerotic subject matter within digital
contexts. I find that these debates interestingly probe the question
of how textual scholarship in Queer Studies might restore or "rescue"
literary material and queer subjects from the past.
</p>

<p>
This project endeavours to answer a question that plagues the emerging
field of Queer Digital Humanities, or "Queer DH." As TEI and Literary
Scholar Julia Flanders asks--<i>do we need to queer markup or is markup
already queerable?</i> Flanders questions markup's place between two
current approaches in Queer DH: first, the approach that wants to
disrupt formal systems by imagining alternative ones;<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and
second, the approach in which queerness is built into computing, is
inherent in computational logic.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> I end with proposing a method
for electronic editing that marks Wilde's alterations and deletions in
TEI formal language to explore this question of TEI's queerability. My
method examines how TEI might work within a queer ethos as a tool of
containment for speculative analysis by enclosing and fixing
homoerotic elements in text.

<p>
Before proceeding with the content of Wilde's manuscript, I will give
a general overview of editorial approaches in the field of Textual
Scholarship. Dominant editorial practices increasingly delimit the
purpose and purview of the editor as a recoverer or preserver of
texts, while other perspectives permit the authority of the editor as
an enabler of textual readings. The history of Textual Criticism thus
presents an arc, which first tends toward what I call the "restorative
approach" then, spurred by the advent of digital technology, the
"productive approach." As I review the different approaches, I
emphasize how the <i>productive</i> capacity functions within textual
editing paradigm. Aided by the popularization of digital tools,
editing becomes less about "correcting" or aligning text with a prior
witness, and more about finding ways to multiply the text's potential
forms and readings. 
</p>

<p>
The "restorative approach" begins with the work of Ronald B. McKerrow,
a leading twentieth-century Shakespearean scholar, who maintains that
the goal of scholarly editing is to preserve authorial
intention. McKerrow's influential model for "copy-text" editing, which
establishes the base text for editing (the "copy-text") on an early
witness that most closely resembles the author's original intention,
eventually creates resistance among textual scholars who decry the
"the tyranny of the copy-text." To address these concerns, Walter
W. Greg's <i>The Rationale of Copy-Text</i> expands critics' purview to
other witnesses that may contain substantive changes by the
author. Fredson Bowers and Thomas Tanselle advance Greg's work,
emphasizing the importance of authorial intention in the
"Greg-Bowers-Tanselle method." Their method favors the "eclectic
edition," which draws from multiple sources and depends heavily on the
editor's judgment to determine authorial intention in each
source. Tanselle places much value in the editor who, according to
Tanselle, is the only one able to recognize and manage inevitable
textual corruption. In the below passage, Tanselle describes the
physical "text" as a vessel for the ideal "work" that can only be
realized by the editor:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of
it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in
sound waves&#x2026; its medium is neither visual nor auditory. The medium
of literature is the words (whether already existent or newly created)
of a language; and arrangements of words according to the syntax of
some language (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses
or punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are
reported by voice or in writing. 16-17
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tanselle explains that act of inscription involves physical tools that
ultimately corrupt the pure ideas "in the mind" of the writer. In
order to realize the ideal form of her text, therefore, the writer
requires an editor who remains sufficiently distant from the creation
and transcription of the text to objectively intimate its true
intention.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of the 20th century, some textual critics take an
opposing perspective on the effect of inscription and tools on the
textual material. D.F. McKenzie, in particular, in his ground-breaking
work, <i>Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts</i> (1999), examines how
the materiality of texts, which include sound and electronic media,
takes on new forms and meanings in in their reprinting and
reproduction. McKenzie traces what he calls the "sociology" of texts
by studying the social context that produced each witness. He points
out that "Every society rewrites its past, every reader rewrites its
texts, and if they have any continuing life at all, at some point
every printer redesigns them” (25). According to McKenzie, the book is
never a single object, but a product of a number of human agencies and
mechanical techniques that are historically situated. As a result, no
single witness, regardless of scrupulous editing by the critic, can
represent an "ideal" version.
</p>

<p>
Jerome McGann explores how McKenzie's sociological perspective in
editing might be expanded into digital formats. McGann applies
McKenzie's ideas to a digital editing environment, where electronic
media creates opportunities for presenting textual variation. McGann
explains that textual criticism in print format is limited because it
must conform to its object of study&#x2014;to the linear and two
dimensional form of the codex. Thus, paper-based editions are clunky
and inadequate, and newer editions often “feed upon and develop from
[their] own blindness and incapacities” (McGann, 81). By contrast,
digital editions can be designed for complex, reflexive, and ongoing
interactions between reader and text. McGann notes that his work on
the digital <i>Rossetti Archive</i> brought him to repeatedly reconsider
his earlier conception and goals, explaining that the archive "seemed
more and more an instrument for imagining what we didn’t know” (82).
</p>

<p>
McGann's position represents what I call the "productive approach" to
textual editing, which contrasts from Tanselle's "restorative
approach." In McGann's approach, the fidelity toward authorial
intention is replaced with a drive to harness the potentiality of
textual variation. McGann takes the transformation of literary
material into electronic format as a vehicle for a critical analytical
method that he and Lisa Samuels call "deformative criticism."
Deformative criticism works by distorting, disordering, or
re-assembling literary material, continually subscribing the text to
new configurations, in order to estrange the reader from her
familiarity of the text. This estrangement forces the reader to
encounter the text in a new way and discover new insights about its
formal significance and meaning. McGann explains that, “Aesthetic
space is organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the
elements making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even
reverse themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete
quantum levels” (McGann 183). The meaning of particular words in a
literary text depends upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent
readings through that text, to the significance of immanent elements
such as typography and blank spaces, all of which the reader can only
process a limited amount.

<p>
There is a debate in Queer Historiography that parallels the one I've
highlighted in Textual Scholarship. It centers on the ability of
critics in the present to adequately know queerness in the past. On
the one side, there is the "Queer Historicist" position, advocated by
scholars like David Halperin and Valerie Traub, who maintain that
homosexuality is historically constructed, that it means something
different today than it does in the past, and that we can get at what
it means by tracing the discussions about sex and sexuality over
time.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> On the other side are the "unhistoricists," including
Jonathan Goldberg, Madhavi Menon, and Carla Freccero, who are wary of
historiographical methods that demarcate queer subjectivity across
history in ways that imply progress.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> They maintain that although
one can not fully know what "queer" is or has meant, one may pursue a
method of <i>homohistory</i>, "with all its connotations of sameness,
similarity, proximity, and anachronism" (Goldberg, Menon
1609). Goldberg and Menon caution that historiographical methods that
attempt to pin down "queer" throughout history have the effect of
normalizing queerness: "to produce queerness as an object of our
scrutiny would mean the end of queering itself, a capitulation to
teleology" (1608).
</p>

<p>
Heather Love refocuses this debate to examine the relationship between
the critic and the object of study. Love explains that for the queer
critic, "Queer history has been an education in absence: the
experience of social refusal and of the denigration of homosexual love
has taught us the lessons of solitude and heartbreak" (52). Her
methodology takes negative affects like shame, anger, disgust, hatred,
disappointment as phenomena that cannot be resolved, recuperated, or
rescued by the queer historian regardless of how hard she
tries. Rather than attempt fix or redeem the past, Love offers the
methodology of "feeling backward," an accounting of "the social,
psychic, and corporeal effects of homophobia" (2). Love examines a
series of authors throughout the late 19th and early 20th century
whose writing is marked by subjects of "queer suffering," such as the
character Stephen Gordon in Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>
(1928). Unlike criticism that attempts to redeem such subjects,
re-framing their histories of pain into narratives of perseverance or
affirmation, Love endeavors to give them full rein over their own
darkness. For example, Love resists the labelling of Gordon as a
transgender ancestor. To do so would constitute an act of "historical
rescue," and Stephen is "beyond the reach of such redemptive
narratives" (Love 119).
</p>

<p>
Love's method emphasizes queer modes of relationality that do not
presume full connections between the critic and subject of study: "I
want to suggest a mode of historiography that recognizes the
inevitability of a 'play of recognitions' but that also sees these
recognitions not as consoling but as shattering" (45). Love is
interested in the way that subjects turn away or refuse the critic's
attempt to "redeem" or "rescue" them. She gives the example of the
myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, pointing out that Orpheus turns back not
because he cannot wait to behold his beloved, rather that he <i>prefers</i>
to behold her in her darkness, in the image of loss <sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. This is a
crucial lesson for queer critics, as it informs the root of the desire
for identification. Love explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[Eurydice's] specific attraction for queer subjects is an effect, I
want to argue, of a historical experience of love as bound up with
loss. To recognize Eurydice as desirable in her turn away is a way of
identifying through that loss. Such an approach would be consistent
with an important aspect of contemporary queer politics, which has
tended to define community not as constituted by a shared set of
traits, but rather as emerging from a shared experience of social
violence. 51
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Because queer history is what Love describes as "an education in
absence," queer critics and historians are predisposed toward
figurations of solitude and heartbreak (52). Bringing Eurydice into
the light of day would transform her into something else, something
less desirable.
</p>

<p>
The impulse that Love describes of the queer theorist to "rescue"
queer figures from the past evokes that of textual scholars like
Tanselle who wants to "recover" authorial intention in their
editing. Both queer historiography and textual scholarship are plagued
by the problem of what to do with the materials from the past. Both
are searching for some kind of origin and only the queer scholar knows
this is impossible, as Love explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Such is the relation of the queer historian to the past: we cannot
help wanting to save the figures from the past, but this mission is
doomed to fail. In part, this is because the dead are gone for good;
in part, because the queer past is even more remote, more deeply
marked by power's claw&#x2026; Such a rescue effort can only take place
under the shadow of loss and in the name of loss; success would
constitute failure. 51
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Taking this impossibility as inspiration, one might rethink what to do
with, or how to access or preserve, our queer historical
inheritance. Love shows one way out by attending to the historical
record without attempting to redeem or rescue it. Her way is to pay
attention to the negative and elusive affects without trying to
convert or transform them to something more intelligible or
palatable. Taking Love's position as a guide, we might proceed by
knowing that success is impossible, that there will always be
something that eludes containment. This knowledge, rather than
discourage analysis, would encourage the critic to search for and
plumb the ways that queerness continues to escape our grasp.

<h3 id="orgf8a57ce"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> The Manuscript of <i>Dorian Gray</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Now I turn to the revision history of Oscar Wilde’s manuscript of <i>The
Picture of Dorian Gray</i> to trace Wilde's treatment of the story’s
homosexual themes. I focus my examination on one textual witness,
Wilde’s manuscript held at the Pierpont Morgan Library (<i>MS</i>), which
he later revised into the 1890 version of the story in <i>Lippincott’s
Monthly Magazine</i> (<i>DG90</i>), and later, into the 1891 print version,
published by Ward, Lock &amp; Company (<i>DG91</i>). In examining the
manuscript, I isolate the additions, deletions, and alterations that
Wilde imposed the first chapter of the story. My goal is to reveal the
ways in which Wilde obscured its homoerotic content, and to compare my
findings with the conclusions of prominent textual scholars on <i>Dorian
Gray</i>.
</p>

<p>
I limit my focus to the first chapter for two reasons: first, it lays
out the dynamics between the central characters—-Basil Hallward, Lord
Henry and Dorian Gray; second, compared to other chapters, it is
heavily revised and presents a rich resource for analysis. Before
going into the revisions themselves, I will briefly review the story's
composition history over two years, from the summer of 1889, when the
story was first solicited from Wilde by the editor of <i>Lippincott’s
Monthly Magazine</i>, to the spring of 1891, when it was finally
published in book form by Ward, Lock, and Company.
</p>

<p>
As far as scholars know, the history of Dorian Gray begins with a
dinner on August 30th, 1889 between John Marshall Stoddart, an
American publisher from J.B. Lippincott Company in Philadelphia, the
British author Arthur Conan Doyle, and Wilde. The outcome of the
dinner is reported by Doyle in his memoirs: "both Wilde and I promised
to write books for 'Lippincott’s Magazine'" (Rpt. Lawler 7). A few
months later, Wilde writes to Stoddart in response to his rejection of
Wilde's submission, a fairy tale entitled "The Fisherman and His
Soul". In this letter, Wilde promises Stoddart "a new story which is
better than 'The Fisherman and His Soul,'" on which he "quite ready to
set to work" (Rpt. Lawler 8). Presumably, Wilde drafts this new story
until April or May of 1890, when it is typed and revised before being
mailed to Stoddart’s offices in Philadelphia. The surviving manuscript
and typescript indicate that Wilde revised his work multiple times
throughout composing and transcribing. Joseph Bristow, the editor of
<i>The Variorum Edition of</i> Dorian Gray, remarks that "it remains
obvious from the manuscript and the typescript that the
author&#x2026; worked with immense care and forethought in preparing his
work for Stoddart" (xxxv). 
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1890, Wilde sends the typescript to Stoddart. After
excising some 500 words from the typescript, Stoddart publishes the
story on June 20, 1890, in <i>Lippincott's</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> This initial version
of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" runs just over 50,000 words, spanning
98 pages over 13 chapters, and was released simultaneously in
Philadelphia and London on June 20, 1890. In England, the story was
widely popular and reviewed by the press, many of the prominent
newspapers criticized the it's ambiguous stance on a clearly immoral
protagonist. Bristow explains that "[Wilde’s] narrative struck the
ostensibly liberal <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, the high Tory <i>St James
Gazette</i>, and the staunchly imperialist <i>Scots Observer</i> as a work
that appeared 'corrupt', displayed 'effeminate frivolity', and dealt
'with matters only fitted for the Criminal Investigation Department'"
(xviii). Wilde would spend the next several days defending his work in
letters to the editors, entering into a public correspondence with
them.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
A few months later, in the early spring of 1891, Wilde publishes a
"Preface" to "The Picture of Dorian Gray" in <i>The Fortnightly
Review</i>. According to scholar Barbara Leckie, the "Preface" responds
directly to the suppressive climate that surrounds the Lippincott’s
publication: “Wilde advances an art-for-art’s sake position that
attempts to remove the novel from the debate by severing the
connection between art and society and, despite other statements to
the contrary, denying the moral force of literature” (171). In a list
of concise aphorisms, the "Preface" makes claims such as, "Those who
find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being
charming. This is a fault" and "To reveal art and conceal the artist
is art’s aim" (Gillespie 3-4). By these complex and incisive
statements, Leckie maintains that "Wilde's strategy is to refocus on
art and disparage the focus on the reader by saying that the reader is
the one who makes a work immoral" (173). Similarly, Lawler argues that
"the 'Preface' relates to the novel only obliquely by subverting the
standards of Philistine art criticism and holding up aesthetic beauty
and artistic effect as the only legitimate criteria of critical
evaluation" (16). Though Wilde may have seen the "Preface" as an
opportunity to indict those readers who would impose a moral judgement
on Dorian, as indeed many of his critics had done, it actually
obscures this message by burying it in paradox and contradictions. The
effect would be to confuse and distract some readers from realizing
that they were the objects of Wilde’s critique. Nicolas Ruddick points
out that "the obvious contradiction between the retained episode of
the poisonous yellow book and the prefatory aphorism beginning 'There
is no such thing as a moral or immoral book' would be offered as one
of the delicious paradoxes that might bother only the small-minded"
(131).
</p>

<p>
Wilde subsequently worked on revising the <i>Lippincott’s</i> version of
the story for publication by Ward, Lock &amp; Company in April 1891. This
new edition contains 78,000 words, or 337 pages over 20 chapters,
including the "Preface." To the original chapters, Wilde added six
chapters to "broaden the social canvas of [his] story by accentuating
the double life that Dorian Gray leads in the contrasting worlds of
upper-class Society, on the one hand, and drug-addicted dissipation,
on the other hand" (Bristow liv). Wilde also continued his revisions
from the manuscript and typescript, deleting and altering passages
that express moments of intimacy and romantic passion between the
characters. According to Victor Frankel, significant deletions include
passages with explicit homosexual references, promiscuous or illicit
heterosexuality, and "anything that smacked generally of decadence"
(47-48). Wilde also revised the ending of the novel in order to
resolve the ambiguity about Dorian’s apparent repentance: for the 1891
edition, Wilde "heighten[ed] Dorian’s monstrosity toward the novel’s
conclusion, making clearer the suggestion that Dorian’s destruction of
the portrait was only an attempt to destroy 'the evidence' against
him" (Frankel 30). In this way, Frankel argues, Wilde aimed to bring
"the novel to a moral conclusion that he thought would silence his
critics" (30).
</p>

<p>
Now I turn to the first chapter. The evocative opening scene, which
consists of a lively dialogue between Basil Hallward and Lord Henry,
sets the tone, reveals character dynamics, and lays out the conflict
for the ensuing story. In these first few pages, Basil comes across as
a sympathetic, sensitive, albeit slightly exasperated artist, who
confides to his close friend the powerful influence that Dorian Gray
has had upon his life and work. Lord Henry, by contrast, appears as an
affable and witty gentleman aesthete, who counters Basil’s
confessional utterances with offbeat aphorisms and paradoxes. There
are a few patterns that emerge from the revisions across these
pages. Many of them focus on Basil’s hesitance and difficulty in
explaining the nature of his devotion to Dorian. Throughout these
revisions, the figure of Dorian is reformulated into an artistic
subject, rather than romantic object, for Basil’s
painting. Additionally, the revisions also work to stifle the
emotional intensity, affection, and intimacy in the dialogue between
Basil and Lord Henry, replacing it with a lighter tone. As I mark the
homoerotic elements that Wilde struck from the manuscript, I create
the following list of themes to organize the revisions: intimacy,
tension, affection, beauty, passion, and fatality.
</p>

<p>
I will begin with the revisions that suppress suggestions of intimacy
between Basil and Lord Henry. In the manuscript, Wilde’s pen slashes
through evidence of physical contact, such as on page nine, which
describes Basil “taking hold of [Lord Henry’s] hand.” Besides removing
evidence of their touching, Wilde also alters the mood of their
conversation, replacing tense pauses with laughter or exchanging
dramatic statements and descriptions with more playful ones. Two
particularly striking moments depict Basil’s struggle to convey why he
cannot exhibit Dorian’s portrait. In the first, Lord Henry encourages
Basil to explain his hesitation. Prior to any revisions, the dialogue
in the manuscript reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry hesitated for a moment. ‘And what is that?’ he asked, in a
low voice. ‘I will tell you,’ said Hallward, and a look of pain came
over his face. ‘Don’t if you would rather not,’ murmured his
companion, looking at him” (MS 9). 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The revised version in the manuscript, incorporating the deletions and
interlinear additions, reads: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry laughed. ‘And what is that?’  he asked. ‘I will tell you,’
said Hallward, and an expression of perplexity came over his face. ‘I
am all expectation Basil,’ murmured his companion, looking at him” (MS
9).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, several changes mitigate the emotions of the scene. First,
rather than hesitate, Lord Henry laughs, and he no longer speaks “in a
low voice”: the effect is to overwrite a previously intimate moment
with levity. Basil also exchanges his emotional misery for mental
confusion when “a look of pain” becomes “an expression of
perplexity”. And lastly, Lord Henry, rather than sympathizing with his
friend’s difficulty and releasing him from the obligation to explain
himself, instead encourages him to speak, “I am all expectation,
Basil”. Together, these changes work to lighten the mood of the scene
and obscure Basil’s internal suffering.
</p>

<p>
As part of allaying the intimacy in the dialogue between Basil and
Lord Henry, Wilde removes suggestions of jealousy between them. At the
end of the first chapter, Basil implores Lord Henry in vague terms to
abstain with regard to Dorian. The original version reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life lovely for
me. Mind, Harry, I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly, and the words
seemed wrung out of him, almost against his will.
</p>

<p>
‘I don’t suppose I shall care for him, and I am quite sure he won’t
care for me,’ replied Lord Henry smiling, and he took Hallward by the
arm, and almost led him into the house. (MS 27, 27B, 28)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this dialogue, the subtextual meaning of Basil’s request—-“Don’t
take [Dorian] away from me”—-reveals itself in Lord Henry’s assurance
that neither he nor Dorian shall “care for” each other. This response
characterizes Basil’s possessiveness over Dorian as a jealous
one. However, the source of Basil’s anxiety changes with the next
revision, where Wilde gives him more lines of explanation and
accordingly alters Lord Henry’s response. The revision thus proceeds:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life absolutely
lovely to me, and that gives my art whatever wonder or charm it
possesses. Mind. Harry, I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly, and the
words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.
</p>

<p>
‘What nonsense you talk,’ said Lord Henry smiling, and, taking
Hallward by the arm, he almost led him to the house. (MS 27, 27B)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this revision, Basil attributes an aesthetic value to Dorian,
asserting Dorian’s importance for his art, giving it “whatever wonder
or charm it possesses.” And Lord Henry’s response moves from
reassurance to dismissal, rejecting Basil’s anxiety as “nonsense”, and
ending the scene on a slightly humorous note. By portraying Dorian as
an artistic subject and asserting Basil’s anxiety about losing that
subject, Wilde evacuates the jealous tension between the two men. And
by transforming Lord Henry’s emotional tone from reassurance to
light-hearted repartee, the interaction loses its intimacy. The effect
is to replace the subtle jealousy and  mutual understanding between
Basil and Lord Henry with a friendly banter.
</p>

<p>
The next theme, tension, is related to intimacy. It similarly tempers
an intense emotional energy, while also mitigating a sense of anxiety
or foreboding. One example occurs on the next page, when Basil is on
the verge of revealing the reasons behind his attraction for
Dorian. The original dialogue proceeds:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,
and he heard his own breath, with a sense almost of fear. ‘Yes. There
is very little to tell you,’ whispered Hallward, ‘and I am afraid you
will be disappointed. Two months ago&#x2026;’” (MS 10).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The manuscript’s revised version reads: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,
and he wondered what was coming. ‘Yes. There is very little to tell
you,’ whispered Hallward rather bitterly, ‘and I dare say you will be
disappointed. Two months ago&#x2026;’” (MS 10).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, rather than draw attention to Lord Henry’s breathing, Wilde
mentions Lord Henry’s “wonder” about Basil’s pending explanation,
shifting Lord Henry’s sense of anticipation from fear to curiosity. He
also makes slight changes to Basil’s delivery: in the revised version,
Basil speaks “rather bitterly” and uses the expression “I dare say”
rather than “I am afraid”. Both changes diminish the confessional tone
that originally precedes Basil’s revelation about Dorian Gray.
</p>

<p>
Often throughout this chapter, Wilde cuts through individual words and
replaces them with ones that are less precise and suggestive,
distracting from the original connotation. He focuses this type of
revision on Basil’s dialogue, particularly when Basil speaks about his
passionate attachment to Dorian, and the effect of Dorian's beauty
upon his art. Here, Wilde will trade expressive nouns with words that
convey relatively weaker or less specific descriptions. For example,
in the sentence “Every portrait that is painted with passion is a
portrait of the artist, not of the sitter”, Basil replaces “passion”
with “feeling” in the manuscript (MS 9), exchanging the romantic
connotation with a more general one.
</p>

<p>
In addition to "passion," Wilde often replaces the word "Beauty" in
Basil's references to Dorian. Wilde revises: “Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose <i>beauty</i> had so stirred me” to
“Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose
<i>personality</i> had so strangely stirred me” (MS 13, my emphasis). The
replacement of “beauty” with “personality” allows Basil to completely
avoid mentioning Dorian’s physical appearance, and the addition of
“strangely” serves to mystify Dorian’s influence over
Basil. Throughout the chapter, Wilde makes several more revisions of
the word “beauty” that relate directly to Dorian: on page six, he
replaces “Dorian Gray’s beauty” with “Dorian Gray’s good looks”; and
on page 18, he exchanges “the beauty of Dorian Gray” with “the face of
Dorian Gray”. The decisions here to replace “beauty” with references
to Dorian’s “face” or his “good looks” maintain the emphasis on the
physical while muting the suggestive power of “beauty” in the
abstract. In doing so, it rids the text from the connotations that
generally accompany “Beauty,” including the ideal, the charming, and
the alluring, to instead convey more specific descriptions of visual
attractiveness. By redirecting the attention from suggestive “Beauty”
in the abstract and toward Dorian’s specific attributes, these
revisions evacuate his mysterious allure, diminishing the overwhelming
influence that Dorian holds over Basil.
</p>

<p>
Another pattern in the revisions works to soften the fatality about
Basil's intense and consuming devotion to Dorian.  First, Wilde takes
out Basil’s references to his troubled state of mind. One example
occurs when Basil recounts his first meeting with Dorian to Lord
Henry. In the original version, Basil admits: “I had a strange feeling
that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I
knew that if I spoke to him, I would never leave him till either he or
I were dead. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room” (MS 12). In
the manuscript, Wilde crosses through “never leave him till either he
or I were dead” and adds, in superscript, “become absolutely devoted
to him, and that I ought not to speak to him.” In removing the
reference to Basil’s death, Wilde eliminates the self-consuming
quality of Basil's devotion. He again revises a reference to Basil’s
death a few pages down, when he professes that “I could not live if I
did not see him every day” (MS 17). On the manuscript, Wilde changes
the line to read, “I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day”
(MS 17). Here, Wilde again avoids admitting the extent to which Dorian
has influenced Basil, tempering the fatality in his attachment to
Dorian.
</p>

<p>
Closer to the end of the first chapter, Wilde deletes a rather
strangely written passage (see Fig. 1) describing the masochistic and
jealous qualities of Basil’s attachment. When explaining to Lord Henry
the nature of his devotion, Basil confesses:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to someone
seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. I seem quite adjusted
to it. I can imagine myself doing it. But not to him, not to him. Once
or twice we have been away together, then I have had him all to
myself. I am horribly jealous of him of course. I never let him talk
to me of the people he knows. I like to isolate him from the rest of
life, and to think that he absolutely belongs to me. He does not, I
know. But it gives me pleasure to think that he does, Harry! MS 23
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the manuscript, Wilde crosses out everything after "a real delight
in giving me pain" up to "But it gives me pleasure to think it does,
Harry!" In doing so, he removes suggestions of Basil’s complicity in
his suffering. By withdrawing these lines, Wilde stifles the
destructive connotations of Basil’s fatalistic devotion to Dorian.
</p>

Library and Museum.
</p>

<p>
My final example concerns a longer passage (see Figs. 2 &amp; 3) that was
heavily revised in the manuscript. The treatment of this passage
crystallizes the various patterns of revision seen so far—-removing
signs of intimacy, diminishing tension in dialogue, references to
Dorian's beauty and Basil's passion and fatality. The passage in the
manuscript bears quoting in full. Prior to any revisions, it reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘You remember that landscape of mine&#x2026; It is one of the best things I
have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it,
Dorian Gray sat beside me, and as he leaned across to look at it, his
cheek just brushed my cheek. The world becomes young to me when I hold
his hand, as when I ask him the [illegible].’
</p>

<p>
‘Basil, this is [illegible] you must not talk [illegible] [illegible]
his power, [indecipherable] to make yourself the [illegible] slave! It
is worse than wicked, it is silly. I hate Dorian Gray.’
</p>

<p>
Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the garden. A
curious smile curled his lips. He seemed like a man in a dream. After
some time he came back. ‘You don’t understand, Harry…’ he
said. ‘Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more
present in my work then when no image of him is there. He is simply a
suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the curves
of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain
colours. That is all.’
</p>

<p>
‘Then why won’t you exhibit his picture?’
</p>

<p>
‘Because I have put into it the romance of which I have never dared to
speak to him. He knows nothing about it, but the world might guess it,
where there is merely love, they would see something evil, where there
is spectacular passion, they would suggest something vile.' <i>MS</i> 20-21
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many of these lines are crossed out, some so heavily, that entire
phrases are illegible, as indicated by the tags. What remains legible,
however, suffices to draw some conclusions about Wilde’s revision
practice. In the first paragraph, the section from “and as he leaned
across” to the end of the paragraph is crossed out in a likely attempt
to remove evidence of physical intimacy (“his cheek just brushed my
cheek”) and suggestions of romance (“the world becomes young to me
when I hold his hand”). While some of this paragraph is legible, the
next one, by contrast, is almost completely blotted out. From what I
can gather, it consists mostly of Lord Henry’s condemnatory and
jealous protestations&#x2013;"his power," "to make yourself the&#x2026; slave!"
and "I hate Dorian Gray." In striking through these lines, Wilde
obscures Lord Henry’s exasperation about Basil succumbing to Dorian’s
charms. Most of the third paragraph eludes erasure, and is preserved
in the manuscript: here, Basil finally explains the precise influence
that Dorian has upon his art&#x2013;as an ideal that inspires and stimulates
beauty in the natural world. Subsequently, in the final paragraph,
Wilde again obscures much of language, particularly this revelatory
line: "where there is merely love, they would see something evil,
where there is spectacular passion, they would suggest something
vile." With this admission, Basil’s meaning throughout the passage
attains clarity: Dorian Gray inspires a powerful, romantic attraction
in Basil that suffuses all of his work with beauty and wonder.

<p>
One of the questions this paper poses is how Wilde’s treatment of
homoerotic themes during the revision of the manuscript fits within
the project of aestheticization as alleged by textual scholars like
Donald Lawler, Joseph Bristow, and Nicolas Ruddick. In one of his
letters to the <i>St James Gazette</i>, Wilde divulges what he calls the
"moral" of the story: "all excess, as well as all renunciation, brings
its own punishment" ("To the Editor of the St James Gazette," June 26
1890). The textual scholarship on <i>Dorian Gray</i> generally agrees that
Wilde supressed the moral by aestheticizing the text. Joseph Bristow
argues that Wilde aimed to obscure the moral from the story’s early
stages, when he was preparing it for publication in <i>Lippincott’s</i>:
“In keeping with the manuscript, in the typescript Wilde proved
reluctant…  to preserve any statements that might lend unnecessary
emphasis to what might be viewed as the implicit moral of the tale’”
(xxxvii). Donald Lawler argues that subordination of the moral to
aesthetic concerns extends to Wilde’s treatment of the homoerotic
content in the story as it evolved from periodical to book version. He
argues that Wilde cuts and revises this type of content for two
reasons: first, to emphasize Dorian’s responsibility over his own
degeneration, and second, to improve the quality of the
writing. According to Lawler, “By Wilde’s shifting his emphasis in the
<i>Lippincott’s</i> and in the Ward, Lock &amp; Company <i>Dorian Gray</i> from
homosexual passion to aesthetic interest, Basil’s culpability is
Dorian’s fall from grace is muffled and reduced finally to that of the
author of the detested painting” (26). The result of the revision is
that Dorian becomes responsible for his own corruption, assuming the
dramatic role as the fallen one. Lawler’s second explanation behind
Wilde’s revisions concern style. Here, he argues that “in most cases
the offensive passages shown above in the notes were cut because of
their mawkish and sentimental writing as much for their affront to
contemporary moral standards” (65). So, from this view, the homoerotic
content was removed either to reduce Basil’s complicity in Dorian’s
corruption or for the sake of style.
</p>

<p>
Nicolas Ruddick offers another perspective on Wilde’s treatment of the
homosexual content as it relates to the moral. Examining the
differences between the <i>DG90</i> and <i>DG91</i>, Ruddick argues that <i>DG90</i>
is the “aesthetically superior” text, because it does a better job
than <i>DG91</i> maintaining a coherence between the story’s two
morals. The two parables concern the dangers of vanity and the
liberalization of homosexuality: while the overt parable “dramatize[s]
the disastrous consequences of the preference of the beautiful at the
expense of the good”, the covert parable, by contrast, “explores the
destructive effects of the clandestine or closeted life” (126,
128). According to Ruddick, while <i>DG90</i> creates a disjunction between
what he calls the “overt” and “covert” parables, of the story, the
revisions in <i>DG91</i> fail to resolve this flaw. Ruddick contends that
Wilde, in <i>DG91</i>, “chose the route of suppression,” reducing the
homoerotic elements and including a preface defending art from the
moral judgements of the bourgeois critic (133). Ruddick explains that
the two parables appear to associate vanity and closeted homosexuality
with corruption: “the appalling changes to Dorian’s painted image in
<i>DG90</i> strongly suggest that the unspeakable practices indulged in by
the protagonist are unspeakable in themselves” (129). So, according to
Ruddick, Wilde’s later story emphasizes a moral that warns against the
dangers of vanity at the expense of one about the liberalization of
homosexuality.
</p>

<p>
How does this debate play out in the first chapter of the manuscript?
Together, the changes between the different textual witnesses suggest
that Wilde had a deliberate purpose in revising the first chapter of
the story. It appears that the revisions work to obscure or diminish
the homosexual and homoerotic elements by turning Dorian into an
aesthetic object. They achieve this goal in three ways: first, by
removing the negative connotations of Basil’s attachment to Dorian,
particularly the consuming intensity of his devotion; second, by
easing the tension surrounding his dialogue with Lord Henry, sometimes
lightening the heavier moments with a touch of comedy; and finally, by
emphasizing Dorian as an ideal subject for art, expanding his appeal
from the romantic and the physical toward a spiritual influence that
inflects his surroundings. In these ways, the revisions turn something
troubling and potentially fatal into a celebration of ideal
beauty. This result also accords with Ruddick’s claim, that the
revisions emphasize a moral that warns against the dangers of vanity
at the expense of a moral about the liberalization of
homosexuality. It seems that, by tempering Basil’s passion and
aestheticizing Dorian, Wilde is able to remove the negative
consequences of passion and replace them with the ones of worshipping
beauty. However, while the earliest version of the story appears to
associate homosexuality and vanity with corruption, it also warns
against interpreting passion as a negative quality. Indeed, Basil
makes precisely this argument when he explains to Lord Henry his
reason for not exhibiting the portrait: “where there is merely love,
they would see something evil, where there is spectacular passion,
they would suggest something vile” (MS 21). This line, struck from the
manuscript, leaves one with the suspicion that Wilde may have silenced
the homosexual themes for the same reason that Basil could not exhibit
his portrait.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
Now I will describe the electronic editing process for this text. I
used a tool called TEI (short for Text Encoding Initiative), which is
a method for encoding texts in such a way that humans and computers
can make sense of them. In more technical terms, TEI is a "markup
language," that enables users to "mark up" aspects of literary texts
that they think are important, like structural elements (chapters,
paragraphs, line breaks), physical details about the text (revisions,
illegible text) or conceptual elements (like personages or
places). TEI resembles HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is
another popular markup language, and indeed, both descend from the
same parent language, SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). As
"markup schemas," both TEI and HTML are annotations within a text that
describe its structural, renditional, or conceptual elements. All
texts are implicitly encoded (or marked up) in the sense of
punctuation, capitalization, disposition of letters around the page,
even the spaces between words.
</p>

<p>
TEI was created specifically for markup up literary material. It
consists of a set of guidelines that facilitates electronic editing,
digitization, and transcription of print text or
manuscripts. Maintained by the TEI Consortium, the guidelines contains
rules for using various "tags" to mark up certain textual elements,
such as <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> to indicate a line of text, <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>, to indicate
deleted text, and <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>, for a reference to a person. Below is an
image of TEI text, in this case the manuscript from Mary Shelley's
<i>Frankenstein</i>, digitized and encoded by the Shelley-Godwin Archive
(see Fig. 4).
</p>

<p>
<img src="./fig_4.png" alt="fig_4.png" />
Fig 4: Image of the manuscript and diplomatic transcription of
<i>Frankenstein</i> from the Shelley-Godwin Archive.
</p>

<p>
Here is an excerpt of some of the TEI code underlying this diplomatic
transcription. Note that the first few lines of the text contained
within the <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags, and the deleted text contained within
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tags:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
&lt;handShift medium="pen" new="#mws"/&gt; 
&lt;line&gt;Those events which materially influence our fu&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;line&gt;ture destinies 
&lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;are&lt;/del&gt; often 
&lt;mod&gt;
    &lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;caused&lt;/del&gt;
    &lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;by slight or&lt;/del&gt;
    &lt;add hand="#pbs" place="superlinear"&gt;derive thier origin from
    a&lt;/add&gt;
  &lt;/mod&gt; tri
&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;line&gt;vial occurence
&lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;s&lt;/del&gt;. 
&lt;mod spanTo="#c56-0005.01"/&gt;
&lt;del rend="strikethrough" next="#c56-0005.02"&gt;Strange as the&lt;/del&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
As one can see in the markup, TEI facilitates deep and complex
description of textual material. TEI allows for textual elements to be
searched, processed, and rendered to facilitate scholarly research. In
the above example, this includes a diplomatic transcription of
manuscript materials, with specific information about who is writing
which portions of the text. The text is encoded according to the
"hand," indicated by the <code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> tag and <code>@hand</code> attribute, of
either the main author Mary Shelley, who composed the text, or her
husband, Percy Shelley, who edited. In line 8 of the above TEI
excerpt, one can see that Percy Shelley makes an addition within the
<code>&lt;add&gt;</code> tag.
</p>

<p>
Besides encoding text for diplomatic transcription, one can also
encode text for references to persons or places. For example, <i>The
Willa Cather Archive</i> describes in detail personal and geographical
references within her correspondance. Below is an image (see Fig. 5)
of an excerpt of a letter, which contain encoded references.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>
</p>

<p>

Archive.
</p>

<p>
Similarly to the <code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> tag in the Shelley-Godwin Archive, this
project uses tagging to reference external entities. Each person or
place is encoded with a <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;placeName&gt;</code> element, which
contains a unique identifier (the <code>@target</code> attribute) for each entity
that points to the description of each entity in the textual
apparatus.
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
&lt;persName target="psn:0105"&gt;Grandma&lt;/persName&gt;
is much better now though we do not think she will ever walk again.
&lt;persName target="psn:1277"&gt;Her son&lt;/persName&gt;

&lt;placeName target="geo:0223"&gt;Va.&lt;/placeName&gt;
spent six weeks with us. He,
&lt;persName target="psn:0180"&gt;papa&lt;/persName&gt;
&amp;
&lt;persName target="psn:0198"&gt;Mama&lt;/persName&gt;
went to
&lt;placeName target="geo:0062"&gt;Denver Col.&lt;/placeName&gt;
and had a very pleasant time.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Perhaps the most useful aspect about TEI is its customizability. As an
extension of XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, specifically made to
render humanities textual data, TEI is further extensible. Users can
create their own tags to fit specific needs. Before moving on to
describe TEI customization, it bears reviewing some of the other
qualities that TEI inherits from XML. XML documents resemble an
ordered hierarchy or nested tree structure, with the one "root"
component and several "branches" that divide into smaller components,
which David J. Birnbaum describes as "nodes."  Birnbaum uses the
example of a book to explain the organization of an XML document,
using the <code>&lt;book&gt;</code> element as the root nodes, which contains child
nodes for title page, table of contents, chapters, and paragraph
elements. These would be formalized into an XML data structure as the
following:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
&lt;book&gt;
    &lt;titlePage&gt;
    &lt;tableofContents&gt;
    &lt;chapter1&gt;
        &lt;paragraph&gt;
        &lt;paragraph&gt;
        &#x2026;
    &lt;chapter2&gt;
    &#x2026;
</p>

</div>

<p>
This hierarchical nature of the TEI means that all elements in the
text must be contained within this bounded structure. All encoded data
must conform to this structure of containment, where one cannot
overlap elements, only nest them. Thus XML is described as "nested" or
"well-formed." Notice in the below example, where the <code>&lt;emphasis&gt;</code>
tags are contained within the <code>&lt;sentence&gt;</code> tags:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
&lt;sentence&gt;This is &lt;emphasis&gt;bad&lt;/sentence&gt;form.&lt;/emphasis&gt; 
&lt;sentence&gt;This is &lt;emphasis&gt;good&lt;/emphasis&gt;form.&lt;/sentence&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Though the strict tagging structure of TEI forces encoders to
categorize or label textual elements in a way that resolves potential
ambiguities, it also encourages them to address more fixed and
disambiguated textual elements. The "eXtensible" in XML means that one
may extend, or customize, tags that suit particular projects. <i>The
Women Writers Project</i>, directed by Julia Flanders, adequately frames
how TEI's inherent extensibility can handle textual
ambiguity. According to the <i>WWP</i>:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
Unlike many standardization efforts, the TEI &#x2026; explicitly
accommodat[es] variation and debate within its technical
framework. The TEI Guidelines are designed to be both modular and
customizable, so that specific projects can choose the relevant
portions of the TEI and ignore the rest, and can also if necessary
create extensions of the TEI language to describe facets of the text
which the TEI does not yet address.
</p>

</div>

<p>
In other words, TEI is built from a language that allows its users, in
turn, to build their own version of that language. As a result, there
is potential for representing the elements necessary to a project by
customizing these elements on a project-by-project basis.
</p>

<p>
In order to be standardizable and sustainable across a variety of
contexts, TEI imposes a certain fixity on textual data. However, the
enforcement of standards for encoding text has its drawbacks, in
particular to encoding queer elements. As humanists well know, textual
data is open to interpretation, and there are always elements that
cannot be contained within rigid categories or delimitations. The
TEI&#x2013;both in its format and the content of the tags&#x2013;especially
struggles to register ambiguity in textual data.
</p>

<p>
The encoding of queer gender in TEI is one interesting case
study. Julia Flanders explains that the <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> element, which
describes persons referenced within a text is limited in the kind of
information it can hold, such as one gender identity for each
person. For scholars working to encode multiple or diverse sexual
identities, this data structure creates obstacles. For example, Pamela
Caughie and Sabine Meyer endeavor to encode gender identity in Lili
Elbe's life narrative, <i>Man Into Woman</i>. Elbe, also known as the
Danish artist Einer Wagner, undertook one of the first gender
affirming surgeries in 1930. Caughie and Meyer explain that the TEI,
which only allows one value for the attribute "sex," cannot adequately
reflect the complex sexual oscillations within Elbe's story. The
attempt to mark up Elbe's complex gender ontology brought Caughie and
Meyer against the limitations of the TEI:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[T]he deeper we got into mark-up, the more evident it became that the
categories and hierarchies available to us were inadequate for our
task&#x2026; to identify a male subject who at times presents himself as
masquerading as a woman, at others as being inhabited by one, and who
eventually becomes a woman, in a life history narrated retrospectively
from the perspective of Lili Elbe. 231
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For these scholars, the limitations of the TEI are instructive by
forcing them to consider the ways that computation works on a deeper
level to reify gender as essential. The fixity that the TEI imposes
upon the textual subject brought out the ways that gender is
situational and relational across this text.
</p>

<p>
Other scholars have used TEI's data structure to their
advantage. While TEI is strict about what constitutes a person&#x2013;as an
entity with one sex, for example, it also enables an approach toward
personhood as multiple. Marion Thain's work encoding the diaries of
Michael Field may appear to grapple with the same problem that Caughie
and Meyer encounter with Lili Elbe. Like Caughie and Meyer, Thain
works with a complex writing subject, a late 19th century English
lesbian couple, Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, who write
collectively under the shared pen name, Michael Field. The name
"Michael Field," therefore, is "a bipartite name, signifying the
assumed names of two separate women, as well as appearing to signify
one single male identity" (Thain 228). The TEI allows the encoding of
multiple identities connected to the personages of Edith Cooper and
Katharine Bradley. Thain explains that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[T]he proliferation and slipperiness of names is no mere childish
caprice but a core part of the articulation of queer: an unhinging of
‘given’ or apparently predetermined identity through a strategy that
articulates identity as constantly shifting, constructed, and
performative. Text encoding can, in a simple but powerful way, help us
explore and map this crucial strand of queer identity construction
across the diary. 233
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thain uses the <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> tag to "render searchable words not in the
text but intimately tied to it. This is not a small issue in a diary
in which Katharine Bradley herself is referred to by more than 20
different names" (233). By encoding each identity to its proper
person, either Cooper or Bradley, Thain can solve the problem of
multiple identities through the TEI.
</p>

<p>
If both the Lili Elbe and Michael Field projects deal distinctly with
queer identities, why do Caughie and Meyer struggle to encode Elbe's
identity while Thain appears to succeed with Field? The answer is that
Michael Fields's identity is <i>multiple</i> while Lili Elbe's is <i>plural</i>,
and TEI works best when the data, like Fields's, is discrete. As
Flanders points out, markup is a tool for naming, bounding, and
containment. As such, it works best with information that can be
separated into distinct components in tagging. It does <i>not</i> work well
with smooth information, or ambiguous information, which can be
categorized as partial or shared (Flanders, "Queer Encoding").  TEI
can encode multiple identities or identities contained within certain
entities, as long as these identities do not blend or overlap. The
queerness of Michael Field's identity is that they "do not pretend to
record the life of a single male, as two different hands record the
experience of two clearly differentiated people" (Thain 229). Rather,
this entity contains multitudes of distinct identities connected to
either Cooper or Bradley. Elbe's identity, by contrast, is not
multiple as much as it is plural, containing several identities whose
relationship to each other is ambiguous or continually shifting within
one entity. Elbe's relation to gender is a smooth one, best described
qualitatively, as one that alternatively "masquerades" or "inhabits"
simultaneous gender ontologies. While a queerness like Fields's might
be delineated and contained, with each identity named, and linked, in
Elbe there is a quality of blending which the markup, by its nature,
means to separate and fix.
</p>

<p>
For Flanders, the ability for researchers to create their own custom
tags, for example, allows them to "imagine descriptive systems for
identity that would operate in specific contexts (rather than
totalizing contexts)&#x2026; with appropriate places for saying 'there is
also something incontestable here'" ("Queer Encoding"). Opposing this
view that TEI is flexible enough to engage queerness, scholars like
Caughie and Meyer maintain TEI reinforces the fundamental elusiveness
of mapping gender ontologies: "Data will always be contextual,
limited, and only proximate to any individual identity" (238). So
while TEI encourages the creation of customized tags, the potential
for customization does not enable one to avoid the limitations of
containment, in which all data must be rigidly demarcated within
semantic tags. TEI bounds what it names in ways that preclude plural
ontologies.
</p>

<p>
My customization of the TEI explores how the potential for new
semantic labels engages with the fixed structure of TEI schema. I
describe the changes to the manuscript using a custom set of tags that
register both physical (pen strokes) and conceptual (homoerotic
themes) elements of Wilde's revision. I created two new attributes to
reflect Wilde's treatment of the homoerotic elements. Fist, to
indicate sections of text that are struck out by Wilde's pen, I
created the new attribute, "strokes," and set its value to a
number. Most often, Wilde alternates using one or two or more strokes
of his pen. Sometimes, however, the strokes are too heavy or thick to
enumerate. For these, I used the value "inconclusive." For example, in
the below image (Fig. 6), where Wilde revises the phrase "look of
pain" to "expression of perplexity," Wilde's pen nearly blots out the word
"look," while the word "pain" only has one stroke.
</p>

<p>
<img src="./fig_6.png" alt="fig_6.png" />
Figure 6: Close-up image of detail on MS 9 from The Morgan Library and
Museum. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to strokes, I also created the new attribute,
"implication," and set its value to a number of recurring themes from
the deleted text. The themes are pulled from my close reading of the
chapter revisions, and include: "tension," "intimacy," "affection,"
"beauty," "passion," and "fatality," with the additional values of
"inconclusive" or "illegible" to describe ambiguous elements.
</p>

<p>
My customization creates a formalized method that allows me to mark
the ways that homoeroticism has been elided or transformed as Wilde
prepared the text for publication. That being said, formalization is
not the goal of this particular project. Thinking back to Love's point
that any attempt to affix queerness in the past "can only take place
under the shadow of loss&#x2026; [wherein] success would constitute
failure," my goal is rather to use TEI to probe the limitation of such
a formal method (51). My work in using the attributes surfaces the
ways that Wilde's revisions constitute a spectrum of smooth
information, with boundaries unamenable to demarcation, in which I
have to make final, imposing decisions. For example, in the passage
which contains the "look of pain" phrase, I am compelled to
disambiguate the category of revision. Below is an image of the
manuscript page (Fig. 7) and the TEI markup (Fig. 8).

<p>
When encoding this revision, I struggle to decide if the phrase "look
of pain" expresses more a sense of passion or that of fatality. On the
one hand, "pain" is a strong feeling, or passion, associated with
desire. On the other hand, Basil often draws on pain in his references
to the fatality of his attraction to Dorian, as in the following
quote, which was deleted: "I feel, Harry, that I have given away my
whole soul to someone seems to take a real delight in giving me pain"
(MS 23). Adding another layer of complexity to this example, Wilde
uses different kinds of strokes for the same phrase. With TEI, it is
impossible to mark the variations in strokes without separating the
single revision into two instances. Therefore, in marking the strokes,
I opted to use the value "inconclusive."
</p>

<p>
More examples occur across the themes of intimacy and affection. In
the below passage (see Fig 9), Wilde revises the phrase "and as he
leaned across to look at it, his cheek just brushed my cheek" to "and
as he leaned across to look at it, his hair just touched my hand" (MS
20). Due to its physical nature, I categorized this particular phrase
as "affection." However, because it is part of a longer passage, I
modified my label to "passion," which is a more general term that
includes other revisions done in the same sentence, such as "The world
becomes young to me when I hold his hand" (MS 20).

</p>

<p>
To fix these ambiguities, I could tag them with both or even multiple
values. But such tagging would dilute the analytical utility of the
TEI, which is meant to be decisive rather than exhaustive. On the
other hand, I could be even more specific, employing qualitative
markers that are ever more precise, "tenderness" in addition to
"affection," or "ardor" and "devotion," in addition to "passion," for
example.  However, the more specific the tags, the less possibility of
finding connections between them, and the more demarcated the
possibilities for analysis.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
My approach in customizing the TEI is to handle queer elements in a
such way that engages the lessons from queer history. This approach
attends to the slippery themes that elude containment, such as
intimacy and affection, or passion and fatality. Heather Love's
characterization of queerness as "always bound up with loss," enables
textual scholars to accept that queerness is, like Eurydice, already
turning backward (51). That the attempt to "rescue" or "recover"
certain textual elements will only lead to inevitable failure. TEI in
particular encourages the encoder to impose a level of fixity on
text. Therefore, I have tried to tag the homoerotic elements in a way
that enables them to retain some of their elusiveness, without
attempting to pin down or transform their elusiveness into something
more intelligible and palatable.
</p>

<p>
My question, moving forward, is how do we label something as fixed and
at the same time maintain its fluidity? How might we approach tagging
as a way of releasing textual meaning, rather than attempting to
"recover" or "rescue" what is turning backward within the composition
history? Drawing from Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuel's idea of
deformance, we might look at the formalizations produced by this TEI
schema not for what it reveals about Wilde's intentions, but for how
it releases potential readings of the composition history. Such an
approach would redeploy the categorization and labelling of markup
toward speculative experimentation, exploring what Kadji Amin, Amber
Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez describe as “queer form”— “the range of
formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies that make difference a
little less knowable, visible, and digestible.” Keeping a critical
awareness of the TEI limitations, one might use the tool to mark and
visualize queer form, particularly the elusive affects, repressed
desires, and other coded elements of queerness within this text. When
grappling with the strict structure of the TEI, running up against
what can and cannot be encoded, one recognizes what escapes or eludes
our structures for understanding and analyzing queerness to rework
those forms into new configurations.

Orpheus seeks to rescue Eurydice from Hades, the lord of the
Underworld, on the condition that he does not turn around to look back
at her until they exit the Underworld and re-emerge into the
