            <p> The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind
               stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy
               scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the <add place="above">pink</add>
               flowering thorn. </p>
            <p> From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-boys on which he was lying, smoking,

               hanging from the tremulous branches that seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a
               beauty so flame-like as theirs: and, now and then, the fantastic shadows of birds in
               flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of
               the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think
               of those pallid jade-faced painters who, in an art that is seemingly immobile, seek
               to convey the laws of swiftness and motion. The sudden murmur of the bees shouldering
               their way through the long unmown grass or circling with monotonous insistance round
               the black-crocketed spines of the early <add place="above"> June </add> holly-hocks,

                     that he absolutely belongs to me. He does not, I know. But it gives me pleasure

                  cigarette with a self-conscious and self-satisfied air, as if he had summed up
                  life in a phrase. </quote> There was a rustle of chirriping sparrows in the ivy,
               and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How
               pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were! Much
               more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul, and the passions
               of one's friends â€“ those were the fascinating things in life. He thought with
               pleasure of the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil
               Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been quite sure to have met Lord
               Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the housing of the
               poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses. It was charming to have escaped all
               that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to Hallward,
               and said <quote> "My dear fellow, I have just remembered." </quote>
