The sudden murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass or circling with monotonous insistance round the black-crocketed spines of the early <sup class="sup">June </sup> holly-hocks, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive, <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> and the dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of <sup class="sup">a distant </sup> organ.</p><p>In the center of the room, <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> <sup class="sup">clamped to </sup> an upbright easel, <sup class="sup">was standing </sup> the full-length portrait of a young man of extraodinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">was sitting</span> sat the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">painter</span> <sup class="sup">artist himself,</sup> Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused <sup class="sup">at the time</sup> such <sup class="sup">public</sup> excitement, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> <sup class="sup">gave rise to so many strange</sup> conjectures.</p><p>As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skillfully mirrored in his art, a <span class="strikethrough"><span class="unclear">delicate[?]</span></span> smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there.

Except of course in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A Bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and consequently he <sup class="sup">always</sup> looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that.

Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white tie, <sup class="sup">as you told me once</sup> any body, <sup class="sup">even a stockbroker,</sup> can gain a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge over-scented dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly <span style="text-decoration: line-through">felt</span> <sup class="sup">became conscious</sup> that some one was looking at me. I turned half way round, and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I <span style="text-decoration: line-through">grew</span> <sup class="sup">was growing</sup> pale. A curious <span style="text-decoration: line-through">feeling</span> <sup class="sup"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></sup> of terror came over me.

My father destined me for the army. I insisted on going to Oxford. Then he made me enter my name at the middle temple. Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up the Bar, and announced my intention of becoming a painter. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so till I met Dorian Gray. Then – but I <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> a terible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> <sup class="sup">fate</sup> had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to him, I would <span style="text-decoration: line-through">never leave him till either he or I were dead </span> <sup class="sup">become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought not to speak to him. </sup> I grew afraid, and turned to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">leave</span> <sup class="sup">quit</sup> the room.

He has stood as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms he has sat on the prow of Adrian's barge lookinginto the green turbid Nile. He has leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water's silent silver the wonder of his own <span style="text-decoration: line-through">beauty </span> <sup class="sup">face</sup> But he is much more to me than that. I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot expres it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know the work that I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way – I wonder will you understand me – his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. "A dream of form in days of thought" – who is it <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that</span> <sup class="sup">who</sup> says that? – I forget; – but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this <span style="text-decoration: line-through">boy</span> <sup class="sup">lad</sup> though <span style="text-decoration: line-through">twenty summers have shown him roses less scarlet than his lips </span> <sup class="sup">he is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">just</span>over twenty</sup> his merely visible presence, ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means. Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in itself all the passion of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> <sup class="sup">romantic</sup> spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body – how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented as a realism that is bestial, an ideality that is void. Harry! Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is <sup class="sup">to me.</sup> You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such <span class="gap"> [...]</span> a <span class="gap"> [...]</span> <sup class="sup">huge</sup> price, but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">and as he leaned across to look at it, his <span class="strikethrough">cheek just brushed my cheek. <sup class="sup">hair just touched my hand.</sup></span> The world becomes young to me when I hold his hand, as when I see him, the centuries yield up all their secrets!"</span>’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘"Basil, this is <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span> you must not talk <span class="gap"> [...]</span> his power, you <span class="gap"> [...]</span> to make yourself the <span class="gap"> [...]</span> of <span class="gap"> [...]</span> slave!

He is never more present in my work then when no image of him is there. He is simply a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. That is all." ’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘"Then why won't you exhibit his <span style="text-decoration: line-through">picture?</span> <sup class="sup">portrait?</sup>’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘"Because I have put into it <sup class="sup">all</sup> the <sup class="sup">extraordinary</sup> romance of which, <sup class="sup">of course,</sup> I have never dared to speak to him.

How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were! Much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends – those were the fascinating things in life. He thought with pleasure of the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been quite sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the housing of the poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to Hallward, and said <span class="quote">‘"My dear fellow, I have just remembered." ’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘"Rememberd what, Harry?" ’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray." ’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘"Where <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I heard the name of </span> was it?"

Women have no appreciation of good looks. At least, good women have not. She saw that he was very earnest, and had a beautiful nature.
