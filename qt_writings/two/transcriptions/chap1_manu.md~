The Picture of Dorian Gray
--------------------------
--------------------------

 The studio was filled with the rich
odour of roses, and when the light summer 
wind stirred amidst the trees of the 
garden there came through the open door
the heavy scent of the lilac, or the
more delicate perfume of the [^pink] flowering
thorn. 

 From the corner of the divan of Persian
saddle-boys on which he was lying, smoking,
as [-was-his-custom-], [^usual] innumerable cigarrettes,
Lord Henry Wotton could just cath the 
[------------] gleam of the honey-sweet and 
hony-colored blossoms of the laburnum, that
was hanging from the tremulous branches that
seemed hardly able to bear th burden of
a beauty so flame-like as theirs: and,
now and then, the fantastic shadows of birds
in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk
curtains that were stretched in front of 
the huge window, producing a kind of
momentary Japanese effect, and making
him think of those pallid jade-faced
painters who, in an art that is 
seemingly immobile, seek to convey the
laws of swiftness and motion. The
sudden murmur of the bees shouldering
their way through the long unmown grass

2

or circling with monotonous insistance
round the black-crocketed spines of 
the early [^June] holly-hocks, seemed to make
the stillness more oppressive, [-------]
[--------------------------------------]
[--------------------------------------]
[------------] and the dim roar of
London was like the bourdon note 
of [^a distant] organ. 

 In the center of the room,
[-----] [^clamped to] an upright easel, [^was standing] the
full-length portrait of a young
man of extraordinary personal 
beauty, and in front of it, some
little distance away, [-----] sat
the [-painter-] [^artist himself,] Basil hallward, whose
sudden disappearance some years
ago caused [^at the time] such [^public] excitement, and
[--------] [^gave rise to] [^so many][^strange] conjectures.

 As he looked at the gracious
and comely form he had so 
skillfully mirrored in his art, a 
[-------] smile of pleasure passed
across his face, and seemed about 
to linger there. But he suddenly 
started up, and closing his eyes
placed his fingers upon the lids,
as though he sought to imprison
within his brain some [----------]
[--------------------------------------]
[---] [^curious] [-----] dream from which he
feared he might awake.

 "It is your best work, Basil,

3

the best thing you have ever 
done," said Lord Henry languidly.
"You must certainly send it [^next year] to 
the Grosvenor. The Academy is too
large, and too vulgar. The Grosvenor
is the only place." 

 "I don't think I will send it
any where," he answered, tossing
his head back in that odd
way that used to make [----] [^his friends] laught
at him in Oxford. "No: I won't
send it any where. And yet, you 
are quite right about it. It is 
my best work." 

 Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows,
and looked at him in amazement
through the thin blue wreathes of
smoke that curled [^up in such fanciful whorls] [----]
from his heavy opium-tainted 
cigarette. "Not send it anywhere?
My dear fellow, why? Have you 
any reason? What odd chaps
you painters are! You do any thing 
in the world to gain a reputation.
And soon as you have [----] [^one], you seem
to want to throw it away. It is
silly of you, for there is only
one thing in the world worse than
being talked about, and that is 
not being talked about. A portrait
like this would set you far
above all the young men in 
England, and make the old men [^quite]

4

jealous, if old men are [^even] capable
of any emotion." 

 "I know you will laugh at me," 
he replied, "but I really can't
exhibit it. I have put too much 
of myself into it."

 Lord Henry stretched his long
legs out on the divan, and shook 
with laughter.

 "Yes: I knew you would laugh,
but it is quite true, all the 
same."

 "Too much of yourself in it!
Upon my word, [^Basil] I didn't know
you were so vain, and I really
can't see any resemblance between
you with your rugged
strong face, and your coal-black hair, 
and this young Adonis, who 
looks as if he was made of
ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my 
dear Basil, he is a narcissus!
And you--well of course you 
have an intellectual expression,
and all that. But Beauty,
real Beauty, [-only begins-] [^ends] where
an intellectual expression begins.
Intellect is in itself an
exaggeration, and destroys the
harmony of any face. The
moment one [----] sits down to
think, one becomes all nose, or
all forehead, or something horrid. 

5

Look at the successful men in any
[----] [^of the] learned professions. How perfectly
hideous they are! Except of 
course in the Church. But then
in the Church they don't think. A 
Bishop keeps on saying at the
age of eighty what he was told
to say when he was a boy of
eighteen, and consequently he [^always] looks
absolutely delightful. Your
mysterious young friend, whose 
name you have never told me
but whose picture really fascinates
me, never thinks. I feel quite 
sure of that. He is a brainless,
beautiful thing, who should be
always here in winter when we
have no flowers to look at, and 
[^always here] in summer when we want something 
to chill our intelligences. Don't
flatter yourself, Basil. You 
are not in the least like him."

 "You don't understand me, Harry.
Of course I am not like him. 
I know that perfectly well. Indeed
I should be sorry to look like
him. You shrug your shoulders?
I am telling you the truth. There
is a fatality about all physical
as well as intellectual distinction, the
sort of fatality that seems to
dog [^through history the faltering] [----] steps of Kings. It is
better not to be different from one's

6

fellows. The ugly and the stupid 
have the best of it in this world.
They can sit quietly, and gape at the play. If they know nothing of
victory, they are [^at least spared] [----] the knowledge 
of defeat. They live as we all 
should live, undisturbed, indifferent,
and without disquiet. They neither
bring ruin upon ohers, nor ever
receive it from alien hands. Your
rank and wealth, Harry; my
brains, such as they are, my
fame, whatever it may be worth;
Dorian Grey's [-beauty-] [^good looks]; we will
all suffer for what the Gods
have given us, suffer terribly."

 
 "Dorian Grey? Is that his 
name?" said Lord Henry, walking 
across the studio toward Basil
Hallward.

 "Yes: that is his name. I
did'nt intend to tell [^it to] you."

 "But why not?"

 "Oh! I can't explain. [----] When 
I like people immensely, I 
[-cannot-] [^never] tell their names to any one. 
It seems like surrendering a part
of them. You know how I love 
secrecy. It is the only thing 
that can make a modern life
woderful, or mysterious to us.
The commonest thing is delightful 
if one only hides it. When I

7

[-dine out-] [^leave town] I never tell my people
where I am going. If I did, I
would lose all my pleasure. It is 
a silly habit, I daresay, but
somehow it [----] seems to bring 
a great deal of romance into 
one's life. I suppose you think
me awfully foolish about it?"

 "Not at all," answered Lord
Henry, laying his hand upon his 
shoulder; "not at all, my dear
Basil. You seem to forget that
I am married, and the one charm
of marriage is that it makes
a life of deception absolutely
necessary for both parties. I mnever
know [----] [^where] my wife is [----], and
my wife never knows [----] [^what] I 
am [^doing.] When we meet -- we do
meet occasionally, when we dine,
out[^together], or go down to the Duke's --
we tell each other the most 
absurd stories with the most
serious faces. My wife is very
good at it, much better in
fact than I am. She never
gets confused over her dates,
and I always do. But when she
does find me out, she never
makes a row. I sometimes
wish she did, but she merely
laughts at me."

 "I hate the way you talk
 
 8
 
 about your married life, Harry,"
 said Basil Hallward, shaking his
 hand off, and strolling towards
 the door that led into the garden.
 "I believe that you are really a
 very good husband, but that you 
 are thoroughly ashamed of your
 own virtues. You are an extraordinary
 fellow. You neve say a moral
 thing, and you never do a
 wrong thing. Your cynicism is 
 simply a pose."
 
  "Being natural is simply a
pose, and the most irritating
pose I know, [-said-] [^cried] Lord Henry
laughing, and the two young
men went out into the garden
together, and for a time they
did not speak. [-to each other-]
 
 After a long pause Lord
Henry pulled out his watch. "I 
am afriad I must be going
Basil," he [-said-] [^murmured]," and before I
go I insist on you answering me a question I put to you
[----] [^half an hour] ago."

 "What is that?" asked Basil
 Hallward, keeping his eyes fixed
 on the ground.
 
  "You know quite well."
  
  "I do not, Harry."
  
  "Well, I will tell you what
it is."

9 

 "Please don't."
 
 "I must. I want you to 
[^explain to] [-tell-] me why you won't exhibit
Dorian Gray's picture. I want
the real reason."

 "I told you the real reason."
 
 "No: you did not. You said it 
was because there was too
much of yourself it. Now, that
is childish."

 "Harry," said Basil Hallward, [-taking-]
[-hold of his hand, and-] looking him 
straight in the face, "Every portrait
that is painted with [-passion-] [^feeling] is 
a portrait of the artist, not of 
the sitter. The sitter is merely the
accident, the occasion. It is not
he who is revealed by the painter,
it is rather the painter who [^on the colours of the canvas]
reveals himself. The reason why 
I will not exhibit this picture,
is that I am afraid that I
have shown in it the secret of
my own soul."

 Lord Henry [-hesitated for a-] [^laughed]
[-moment-]. "And what is that?" he
asked. [-in a low voice-].
 
 "I will tell you," said Hallward,
and an [-look-] [^expression] of [-pain-] [^perplexity] came over
his face.

"[-Don't if you would rather not-] [^I am all expectation, Basil],"
murmured his companion, looking at him. 

 "Oh! There is really very little to

10

tell you, Harry," answered the young 
painter; "and I am afraid you will
hardly understand it."

 Lord Henry smiled, and leaning
down plucked a ping-petalled daisy
from the grass, and examined it. "I 
am quite sure I shall understand
[-you-] [^it]," he replied, gazing intently at
the little golden white-feathered
disk. [-that has charmed all our-]
[-poets from Chaucer to Tennyson-].

 The wind shook some blossoms
from the trees, and the heavy lilac
blooms, with their clustering stars,
moved to and fro in the languid 
air. A [-bird-] [^grasshopper] began to [-sing-] [^chirrup] in
[-a thicket-] [^the grass], and a long thin
dragon-fly floated [-past-] [^by] on its
brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt
as if he coul hear Basil
Hallward's heart beating, and he
[-heard his own breath, with a sense-] [^wondered]
[-almost of fear-] [^what was coming.].

 "Yes: there is very little
to tell you," repeated Hallward [^rather bitterly] "and
I [-am afraid-] [^daresay] you will be
disappointed. Two months ago I 
went to a crush at Lady Brandon's.
You know we poor painters have to
show ourselves in society from time
to time, just to remind the public
that we are not savages. With an
evening coat and a white tie, [^as you told me once] any

11

body, [^even a stockbroker,] can gain a reputation for
being civilized. Well, after I had 
been in the room about ten minutes,
talking to huge over-scented dowagers
and tedious academicians, I suddenly
[-felt-] [^became conscious] that some one was looking at
me. I turned half way round, and
saw Dorian Gray for the first 
time. When our eyes met, I felt 
that I [-grew-] [^was growing] pale. A curious [----] [^feeling]
of terror came over me. I knew 
that I had [------] come [-across-] [^face to face with]
someone whose mere personality 
was so fascinating that it would
[-be- -----] [^absorb] my [-life-] [^nature], my soul, my 
art itself." I did not want any
[^extreme] influence [-of that kind-] in my life.
You know yourself, Harry, how 
independant I have always been. My
father destined me for the army. I 
insisted on going to Oxford. Then he
made me enter my name at the
middle temple. Before I had
eaten half a dozed dinners I gave
up the Bar, and announced my
intention of becoming a painter. I 
have always been my own master;
had at least always been so till
I met Dorian Gray. Then -- but
I [----] don't know how to explain
it to you. Something seemed to tell
me that I was on the verge of
[----] a terible crisis in my

12

life. I had a strange feeling that
[---] [^fate] had in store for me exquisite
joys and exquisite sorrows. I knew
that if I spoke to him, I would
[-never leave him till either he or-] [^become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought]
[-I were dead-] [^not to speak to him.] I grew afraid, and
turned to [-leave-] [^quit] the room. It was
not conscience [^that made me do so,] it was cowardice. I
[---] take no credit to myself for
trying to escape."

 "Conscience and cowardice are
really the same things, Basil. Conscience
is the trade-name of the firm, that
is all." 

 "I [-------] [^don't believe that, Harry] [^----]. However,
whatever was my motive, and it
may have been pride, for I used
to be very proud, I certainly
struggled to the door. There of
course I stubled against Lady
Brandon. "You are not going to 
run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?"
She screamed out. You know her 
shrill horrid voice?"

 "Yes: she is a peacock in every
thing but beauty," said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his
long nervous fingers.

 "I could not get rid of her. She
brought me up to the Royalties, and
people with Stars and Garters, and
elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras [^and hooked noses].
She spoke of me as her dearest

13

friend. I had only met her once
before, but she took it into her
head to lionize me. I believe
some picture of mine had made a
great success at the time, at least
had been chattered about in the
penny newspapers, which is the
nineteenth century [---] [^standard] of [fame] [^immortality].
Suddenly I found myself face to
face with the young man whose
[-beauty-] [^personality] had so [^strangely] stirred me. We were
quite close, almost touching. Our
eyes met, again. It was mad of
me, but I asked Lady Brandon to 
introduce me to him. Perhaps it
was not so mad after all. It
was simply inevitable. We would
have spoken to each other without
any introduction. I am sure of that.
Dorian told me so afterwards."

 "And how did Lady Brandon 
describe this wonderful young
[---] [^man?]? I know she gives in
for giving a rapid precis of [^all] her
guests. I remember her bringing
[-up to-] me up to a most truculent
and red-faced old [-man] [^gentleman] covered
all over with orders and ribands,
and hissing into my ear in a
tragic whisper, which must have
been perfectly audible to every
body in the room, something like
"Sir Humpty Dumpty -- you know --

14

Afghan frontier -- Russian intelligence: very 
successful man -- [-quite inconsolable-]
[-wants to marry-] wife killed by an
elephant -- quite inconsolable -- wants
to marry a [^beautiful] American widow [^every body does now-a-days] -- hates
Mr. Gladstone -- but very much interested
in beetles -- ask him about the new
[---] military frontier. "[---] I simply
fled. I like to find out people for
myself. But poor Lady Brandon treats  her
guests, exactly as an auctioneer treats
his goods. She either explains them [^entirely] away
or tells one everything about them [-that-]
[-one does not-] [^except what one] wants to know. But
what did she say about Mr. Dorian
Gray?"

 "Oh, she murmered, 'charming boy --
going to be so ruch -- mother and I great 
friends -- engaged to be married to the 
same man -- I mean married on the
same day -- how very silly of me! Quite
forget what he does -- afriad he doesn't
do anything -- oh, yes plays the piano --
or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?"
We could niether of us help laughing, and
we became friends at once."

 "Laughter is not a bad beginning for
for a friendship, and it is the best
ending for one," said Lord Henry
plucking another daisy.

 Hallward burried his face [---]
 
15

in his hands." You don't understand
what friendship is, Harry," he
murmured," or what enmity is for
that matter. You like every one,
[-which is the same as -----] [^that is to say]
you are indifferent to every one."

 "How horridly unjust of you," cried
Lord Henry, tiling his hat ack,
and looking up at the little
clouds that were drifting across
the hollowed turquoise of the [^summer] sky,
like ??? skeins of glossy
white ???. "Yes" horribly unjust
of you. I make a great
different between people. I choose
my friends for their good looks:
my acquaintences for their
characters: and my enemies for
their brains. A man can't be too
careful in the choice of his 
enemies. I have not got one
who is a fool. They are all
men of some intellectual power,
and consequently they all appreciate
me. Is that very vain of me? I 
think it is rather vain."

 "I should think it was, Harry.
But according to your category, I 
must be merely an acquaintance."

 "My dear old Basil, you are
much more than an acquaintance...

 "And much less than a friend. A
sort of brother, I suppose?

16

 "Oh! Brothers! I don't care for 
brothers. My elder brother won't
die, and my younger brothers
[^seem] never [^to] do anything else."

 "Harry!"

 "My dear fellow, I am not
quite serious. But I can't
help detesting my relations. I 
suppose it comes from the fact
that we can't stand other
people having the same faults
as ourselves. I quite sympathize
with the rage of the [^English] democracy
[-to English-] against what they
call the vices of the upper
classes. They [^feel] [---- to think-]
that drunkenness, [---] stupidity,
[^and immorality] should be their own special
property, and that if any one 
of us makes an ass of
himself [---] [^we are poaching on their
preserves. When poor Southwark
got into the Divorce Court, their
[-rage-] [^indignation] was quite magnificant. And
yet I don't suppose that
ten per cent of the lower orders
live with their own wives."

 "I don't agree with a single
word that you have said, and,
what is more, [^Harry,] I don't believe
you do either."

 "Lord Henry [-pulled his little-]
[-straw-colored mousatache, and-]
stroked his pointed [-Henry ---] [+brown] beard, and

17

tapped the toe of his patent-leather
boot with a [-thick-] [^tasseled] malacca-cane.
How English you are, Basil! If one
puts forward an idea to a real 
Englishman -- always a rash thing
to do -- he never dreams of
considering whether the idea is
right or wrong. the only thing he
considers of any important is
whether one [-is sincere or putting-]
[-it- ---] believes it oneself.
Now the value of an idea has
nothing whatsoever to do with the
sincerity of the man who expresses 
it. Indeed the probabilities are that 
the more insincere the man is, the
more purely intellectual will the 
idea be, as [^in that case] it will not be coloured
by either his wants, his desires, or
his prejudices. However, I don't 
propose to discuss [---] politics,
sociology, or metaphysics with you.
I like persons better than principle.
Tell me more about Dorian Gray.
How often do you see him?"

 "Every day, Harry. I coudln't [---] be
[--] [^happy] if I didn't [--]see him 
every day. Of course, sometimes it 
is only for a few minutes, But
a few minutes with somebody
one worships mean a great
deal."

 "[---] [^But] you [^don't] really worship him?"
 
18

 "I do."

 "How extraordinary! I thought you 
would never care for anything
but your painting -- your art, I
should say. Art souns better,
doesn't it?"

 "He is all my art to me now. I 
sometimes think, Harry, that there
are only two eras [^of any importance] in the 
history of [^the world] [-earth-], [^the first is] the difference of 
a new medium [^in art], and the second 
is [^the] difference of a new personality [^for art also.]
What the invention of oil-painting
was to the Venetians, the [-beauty-] face
of Antinous was to late Greek
sculpture, and the [-beauty-] [^face] of Dorian 
Gray will some day be to me. 
It is not merely that I paint
from him, draw from him, model
from him. Of course I have
done all that. He has stood
as Paris in dainty armour, and
as Adonis with huntsman's cloak
and polished boar-spear. Crowned 
with heavy lotus-blossoms he 
has sat on the prow of Adrian's
barge lookinginto the green
turbid Nile. He has leaned over 
the still pool of some Greek
woodland, and seen in the water's
silent silver the wonder of his 
own [-face-] [^beauty]: But he is much more
to me than that. I won't tell you

19

that I am dissatisfied with what I 
have done of him, or that his
beauty is such that art cannot
expres it. There is nothing that 
art cannot express, and I know 
the work that I have done, since
I met Dorian Gray, is [---] good
work, is the best work of my 
life. But in some curious way --
I wonder will you understand 
me -- his personality has suggested
to me an entirely new manner
in art, an entirely new mode of
style. I see things differently, I
think of them differently. I can now
recreate life in a way that was
hidden from me before. "A dream 
of form in days of thought" -- who
is it [-that-] [^who] says that? -- I forget; --
but it is what Dorian Gray has
been to me. The merely visible
presence of this [-boy-] [^lad], though
[-twenty summer have shown him-] [^he is -just- over twenty]
[-roses less scarlet than his lips-]
his merely visible presence, ah! I 
wonder can you realize all that
that means. Unconsciously he defines
for me the lines of a fresh
school, a school that is to have
in itself all the passion of
the [-----] [^romanic] spirit, all the
perfection of the spirit that is

20

Greek. The harmony of soul and 
body -- how much that is! We in
our madness have separated the two,
and have invented as a realism that
is bestial, an ideality that is
void. Harry! Harry! if you only
knew what Dorian Gray is [^to me]! You
remember that landscape of mine, for
which Agnew offered me such [---] a 
[----] [^huge] price, but whcih I would
not part with? It is one of the
best things I have ever done. And
why is it so? Because, while I 
was painting it, Dorian Gray sat 
beside me, [-and as he leaned across-]
[-to look at it, his cheek [^-hair-] hair just-]
[-brushed [^-touched my] my cheek [^-hand]. The world becomes-]
[-young to me when I hold his hand,-]
[-as when I ask him the ----]
[-yield --- their ---------"]

 "Basil, this is [-----] [^quite wonderful. I]
[^must see Dorian Gray] [-not talk-------with you-]
[--------------his power, you-]
[------------to make yourself-]
[-the-------of---slave! It is-]
[-worse than wicked, it is silly. I-]
[-hate Dorian Gray-]"

 Hallward got up from the seat, 
and walked up and down the 
garden. [-A curious smile curled-]
[-his lips. He seemed like a man-]
[-in a dream-]. After some time he 
came back. ‘You don’t understand

21

Harry..." he said. "Dorian Gray is 
merely to me a motive in art. He 
is never more present in my work,
then when no image of him is 
there. He is simply a suggestion, as 
I have said, of a new manner. I see 
him in the curves of certain lines, in 
the loveliness and subtleties of 
certain colours. That is all."

 "Then why won’t you exhibit his 
[-picture-] [^portrait]?"

 "Because I have put into it [^all] the 
[^extraordinary] romance of which, [^of course,] I have never
dared to speak to him. He knows 
nothing about it, [^he will never know anything about it] but the world 
[-would-] [^might] guess it, and [-where there is-]
[-merely love, they would see something-]
[-evil, where there is spectacular passion-]
[, they would suggest something vile], I 
will not bear my soul to their 
shallow [^prying] eyes. My heart shall 
[-not be made their mockery-] [^never be put under their microscope] . There 
is too much of myself in [---] [^the thing,]
Harry, too much of myself!"

 "Poets are not so scrupulous as
you are. They know how useful 
passion is for publication. Now-a-days
a broken heart will run to 
many editions."

 "I hate them for it. An artist
should create beautiful things, but
should put nothing of his own life
into them. We live in an age which

22

men treat art as if it were meant
to be an autobiography. We have
lost the abstract sense of beauty. If
I live I will show the world what
it is, and for that lesson the world
shall never see my portrait of Dorian
Gray."

 "I think you are wrong, Basil, but
I won't argue with you. It is only
the intellectually lost who ever
argue. Tell me; is Dorian Gray very
fond of you?"

 Hallward considers for a few
moments. "He likes me," he answered
after a pause; "I know he likes me.
Of course I flatter him dreadfully.
I find a strange pleasure in saying
things to him that I know I [-will-] [^shall]
be sorry for having said. I give
myself away. [-I told him that-]
[-beauty like his is genius, is higher-]
[^---] ][-than genius, as it needs no-]
[-explanation, and is one of the great-]
[-facts of the world, like sunlight-]
[-or spring time, or-] [^-what -----] [-the explanation in-]
[-dark waters of that thin silver-]
[-shell we call the moon.-] As a 
rule, he is charming to me, and
we walk home together, from the 
club, arm in arm, or sit in the
studio [---- each other-] and talk
of a thousand things. Now and then,
[^---] [-the ----------------------]
however, he is horribly thoughtless, and

23

seems to take a real delight in giving
me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that
I have given away my whole soul to someone
[-seems to take a real delight in-]
[-giving me pain. I can quite-]
[-understand it. I can imagine-]
[-myself doing it. But not to him,-]
[-not to him. Once or twice we have-]
[-been away together, then I have-] [^had] [-him-]
[-all to myself. I am horribly-]
[-jealous of him, of course. I never-]
[-let him talk to me of the-]
[-people he knows. I like to isolate-]
[-him from the rest of life, and to-]
[-think that he absolutely belongs to-]
[-me. He does not, I know. But it-]
[-gives me pleasure to think that-]
[-he does. Harry! I have given this-]
[-boy-] [^-young man-] [-my whole -----] [^who] treats    <-----------------
it as if it were a flower to
put in his coat, a bit of
decoration to charm his vanity, an
ornament for a summer's day."

 "Days in summer, Basil, are apt
[-wax long-] [^to linger]. Perhaps you will tire
ssooner than he will. It is a
sbad thing to think of, but there 
iis no doubt that genius lasts
llonger than beauty. That accounts
ffor the fact that [^we all take such pains] [-we are all-]
[[-horribly overeducated-] [^to overeducate ourselves] in the wold
sstruggle for existence, we want to
hhave something that endures, and so
wwe fill our minds with rubbish and
ffacts, in the silly hope of keeping
oour place. The thoroughly well-informed

224

mman -- that is [^the modern ideal]. [-what we all try to-]
[[-be-] And the mind of the thoroughly
wwell-informed man is a dreadful
tthing. It is like a bric-a-brac 
sshop, all monsters and dust, and
eevery thing priced above its proper
vvalue. I think you will tire first,
aall the same. Some day you will
llook at him, and he will seem to
yyou to be a little out of drawing,
oor you won't like his tone of 
ccolour, or something. You will bitterly
rreproach him in your own heart,
aand seriously think that he has behaved
[[---] [^very badly to] you. The next time he 
ccalls, you will be perfectly cold
aand indifferent. It will be a
ggreat pity, for it will alter you.
Tthe worst of having a romance is
that it makes one so unromantic.

 "Ah! My dear Basil, that is 
exactly why I can feel it. Those
who are faithful know only the
pleasures of love, it is the 
faithless who know love's tragedie," and
Lord Henry struck a light on
a dainy silver case, and began 
to smoke a cigarette with a 
self-conscious and self-satisfied
air, as if he had summed up
life in a phrase. There was a
rustle of chirriping sparrows in the
ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows
chased themselves across the grass
like swallows. How pleasant it
was in the garden! And how 
delightful other people's emotions
were! Much more delightful than
their ideas, it seemed to him. One's 
own soul, and the passions of 
one's friends -- those were the 
fascinating things in life. He thought

26

with pleasure of the tedious luncheon 
that he had missed by staying so long
with Basil Hallward. Had he gone
to his aunt's, he would have been
quite sure to have met Lord 
Goodbody there, and the whole conversation
would have been about the housing
of the poor, and the necessity for model
lodging-houses. It was charming to 
have escaped all that! As he
thought of his aunt, an idea 
seemed to strike him. He turned to
Hallward, and said "My dear
fellow, I have just remembered."

 "Rememberd what, Harry?"
 
 "Where I heard the name of Dorian
Gray."
 
 "Where [-I heard the name of-] was
it?" Asked Hallward, with a
slight frown.

 "Don't look so angry, Basil. It
was at my aunt's, Lady 
Agatha's. She told me she had
discovered a wonderful young
man, who was going to help
her in the East End, and that
his name was Dorian Gray. I am
bound to state that she never
told me he was good-looking.
Women have no appreciation of
good looks. At least, good
women have not. She saw that
he was very earnets, and had

27

a beautiful nature. I at once
pictured to myself a creature
with spectacles and -no-] [^lank] hair, horribly
freckled, and [^tramping about on] [-with-] huge feet. I
wish I had known it was your
friend."

 "I am glad you didn't, 
Harry."
 
 "Why?"

 "I don't want you to meet him."
 
 "Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, Sir"
said the butler coming into the 
garden.

 "you must introduce me now," [-said-] [^cried]
Lord Henry, laughing.

 Basil Hallward turned to the
[-servant-] [^butler] who stood blinking in the
sunlight. "Ask Mr. Gray to wait,
Parker; I will be in in a few 
moments." The man bowed, and 
went up the walk.

 Then he looked at Lord Henry.
"Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,"
he said. "He has a simple and
a beautiful nature. Your aunt 
was quite right in what she
said of him. Don't spoil him
for me. Don't ry to influence
him. Your influence would be
bad. The world is wide, and
has many marvellous people in
it. Don't take away from me the
one person that makes life [-lovely-]

27B

absolutely lovely to me, and that
gives me my art whatever wonder
or charm it possesses. Mind, Harry,
I trust you." He spoke very slowly,
and the words seemed wrung out of 
him as almost against his will.

 "What nonsense you talk," said
Lord Henry smiling, and, taking
Hallward by the arm, he almost
led him into the house.
