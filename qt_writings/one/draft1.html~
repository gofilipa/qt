<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The burden of the chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of gender performativity, and how
that method might leverage computational processes to analyze literary
material that express complex gender ontologies. I begin by debunking
what I call "the fantasy of falsifiable criticism," which includes
distant reading practicies by Franco Moretti and Ted Underwood,
constrasting their work with that of Richard Jean So and Laura
Mandell, whose methods emphasize deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I'm interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by producing new structures, or formalizations of these
texts. For the middle portion of the chapter, I embark on three
"close-readings." First, I do a deep reading of python programming,
focusing on the structure of the <code>for loop</code> and NLTK processes for
cleaning and regularizing text, with the goal of bringing out the
recursive quality of running python code. Then, I dip into Judith
Butler's concept of gender performativity, which lends an
understanding to the ways that critical processes can subvert dominant
structures through iteration, or what she calls "performative
citation." To wrap up this section, I do a close-reading of Virginia
Woolf's text, <i>Orlando</i> that examines the ways that gender is closely
coordinated with the significatory power of language throughout the
novel. In the final section of the chapter, Butler's notion of
displacement through repetition in gender performativity is applied
back to text analysis to illustrate how the iterative process of
analyzing text can surface new textual structures that re-signify
certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with my reading of
Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando</i>, to show how our understanding of "man" and
"woman" in that text is re-signified through this kind of text
analysis.

<p>
This chapter examines how quantitative text analysis, which is a way
of analyzing textual data by computation, such as counting word
frequency or generating associative word pairs, works with data about
queer subjectivity, in this case, with gender. I explore how
computational processing, which "cleans" and "normalizes" textual data
in preparation for quantification and statistical analysis, engages
with gender, which is not discrete or numerical, in text.
</p>

<p>
This examination probes the central tension between "Queer Form," or
figurative and narrative forms by which gender is expressed [further
elaborated in the introductory chapter], and digital formats, where
the logics computation abstracts and transforms text into data. I am
not trying to ascertain whether gender, as an aspect constitutive of
identity (like race, class, or sexuality) can or cannot be quantified
in its complexity. With enough gradations, anything can be transformed
into a digital format. However, preparing a text for text analyis
always requires a reduction of data in which some semantic value has
escaped. Processes like cleaning and normalizing, where text is
transformed into a format to make it computable, constrain textual
meaning. These processes pass text through an automated seive,
filtering out its specificities. For example, in order to be counted
in a word frequency, text has to be rid of elements like punctuation,
articles, prepositions, and word endings. Rather than attempt to
recover semantic escape, I am interested in exploring how possible
approaches for quantification might engage with queerness as a formal
phenomenon, or "queer form," what Kadji Amin, Amber Jamilla Musser,
and Roy Pérez describe as "the range of formal, aesthetic, and
sensuous strategies that make difference a little less knowable,
visible, and digestible."<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> In other words, I am interested in how
a specific approach toward computation can formalize queerness in
computation.
</p>

<p>
So, the question for this chapter is the following: how do we deform a
text to bring out elements of gender?

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
There are several orientations toward reading in literary analysis,
which determine the trajectory of readerly engagement with
texts. Taking the name of "paranoid reading," "sympotmatic," and
"militant reading," is a reading pratice that places importance in
what a text does not say, or what it cannot say. This kind of reading
has been particularly taken with digital methods for literary
criticism.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> In methods like quantitative text analysis, often
called "Distant Reading," the focus of reading for what is hidden or
absent can be exacerbated with the desire to read at scale. Because
computers can process hundreds of texts at a time, "reading" at much
faster rates than humans they offer critics an opportunity for getting
around the problem of literary scale, and particularly attract critics
who pose ambitious questions about literary history.
</p>

<p>
Distant Reading is a way of computing textual data by cleaning,
sorting, and counting textual elements, and can involve more advanced
processes like statistical modelling and machine learning. It borrows
from a variety of quantitative methods in the social sciences and
applies them to textual data, for example in word association, topic
modeling and sentiment analysis. Though they differ in their
specifics, these methods share a faith in using the speed of
computation, which can process very precise elements like word
frequency or patterns, to make calculations about how to categorize or
organize textual data. Moreover, they are made to be used as part of a
scientific method, to help researchers conduct experiments that prove
or falsify their hypotheses. The scientific method is a cyclical
process, wherein researchers make observations on a certain topic,
formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis with experiments, analyze
and report the results, bringing them toward new observations,
hypotheses, experiments, and conclusions. In order for the process to
move forward, the hypothesis must be <i>falsifiable</i>, meaning that it
must be contestable &#x2013; one must be able to imagine an
alternative. This falsifiability ensures that the hypothesis can be
meaningfully tested.
</p>

<p>
Distant Reading furthers many of the impulses of paranoid reading by
applying this paranoia to vast swaths of literary
history. Quantitative methodologies accord well with research programs
that seek answers to big, previously unwieldy questions. Franco
Moretti, for example, explores how social and economic forces impact
literary form in the development of the modern novel. Moretti's work
is interested in drawing connections among a field of data (texts)
that would otherwise be too large and unweildy to work with&#x2013;he
declares that "distance&#x2026; is a condition of knowledge" (<i>Distant
Reading</i> 48). More recently, Ted Underwood, in the field of
Computational Literary Studies (CLS), harnesses the power of
quantification and machine learning to glimpse what he calls the
"distant horizon" of literary trends across centuries<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. Recent
developments in distant reading combine with close reading methods, as
critics will use the results of quantitative analysis to identify key
moments from the text that merit closer attention.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
It is important to examine where these impulses emerge. Moretti, who
is largely responsible for popularizing the practice of DR in English
Studies contexts, greatly influenced the ways that English scholars
approach quantiative methodologies. 
</p>

<p>
In Moretti's early essay, "The Soul and the Harpy" (1983),<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> he
divulges a key motive in developing his methodological approach, which
will eventually flourish into "distant reading." Underlying Moretti’s
methodology is a deep concern with finding a way to ascertain the
effect of historical forces on literary form. But the current
practices of literary criticism present methodological obstacle. In
this early essay, Moretti characterizes literary criticism as "a sort
of cultivated accompaniment to reading – to the reading we are doing
here and now," ("The Soul and the Harpy" 21). By this, he means that
the analytical practices of contemporary literary critics, which
"revolve around concepts such as ‘ambiguity’ and the like," will,
according to Moretti, "always be pushed into multiplying, rather than
reducing, the obstacles every social science encounters when it tries
to give itself a testable foundation" (22). To illustrate the
practices of current literary criticism, Moretti distinguishes between
the historian and the student of literature:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The [student] – unless desirous of turning into that legendary figure
whose only pleasure lay in contemplating his own reflection – must
concentrate on the dissimilarities and ruptures: on what has been lost
and become irretrievably unfamiliar, and which we can 're-familiarize'
only by doing such violence to it that we distort the objective,
material consistency of every work which it is the task of scientific
knowledge to reconstruct and 'salvage'. 14
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to Moretti, the great danger in literary criticism is the
encouragement of narcissistic tendencies in researchers, whose attempt
to "re-familiarize" the object of study does it "violence". Moretti's
proposed method take a scientific approach that maintains the
"objective, material consistency" of the work. Here, Moretti proposes
a mode of critical inquiry that borrows from the sciences to minimize
the potential for difference and disagreement. In hope of grounding
the critical process on a more solid foundation, Moretti calls for a
"falsifiable criticism" that can "test" literary interpretations, much
like a social science ("The Soul and the Harpy" 21). Falsifiable
criticism would pursue interpretations as "coherent, univocal, and
complete," where the "results" can be compared with "data" which
"appear contradictory or inexplicable in the light of the hypothesis
itself" (21). He envisions a literary criticism that will slowly but
steadily progress toward irrefutable knowledge of literary objects:
"The day criticism gives up the battle cry ‘it is possible to
interpret this element in the following way’, to replace it with the
much more prosaic ‘the following interpretation is impossible for such
and such a reason’, it will have taken a huge step forward on the road
of methodological solidity" (22).
</p>

<p>
This quotation is significant because it shows how distant reading
descends from a desire to rid the critic's subjectivity from the
analytical process. Moretti's critique of literary methods is
erroneous for three reasons. First, the notion that familiarizing the
object of study (which presumably refers to the process of close
reading and textual interpretation) misunderstands the way that
violence has historically worked through separation, creating
unsurmountable borders, or distance between subjects and objects
(Anzaldua). Second, there is no "objective" reading of an object &#x2013;
this is an imperialist illusion &#x2013; there is only the structuring power
which determines the ways that objects are read and interpreted
(Foucault). Finally, the allusion to narcissus is ironic, for
reflection is a function of of distance, not proximity. In attempting
to create an objective "distance" between himself and the work,
Moretti only succeeds in projecting his own presumptions.
</p>

<p>
Moretti's falsifiable criticism eventually grows into "distant
reading," and particularly, "quantitative formalism," which quantifies
literary form (specifically, genre) through quantitative methods that
result in visualization, such as graphs and diagrams. Moretti's use of
quantitative formalism conscripts digital methods toward the same kind
of truth searching in paranoid reading practices. He does this by
placing the burden and faith of knowing on the computer, attributing
the bulk of analytical work to computational and visualization
processes, and relegating the literary critic's role to explain the
results of the computer's analyses. The essays in <i>Distant Reading</i>
increasingly demonstrate how his critical method streamlines into the
neat, recursive processes of hypothesis, collecting and assembling
data, and inference. The results are often unexpected, and sometimes
bring Moretti to reframe his hypotheses. For example, in “Style, Inc.:
Reflections on 7,000 Titles (British Novels, 1740-1850),” Moretti
plots book titles on a series of graphs in order to explore how market
forces influence the titles. He offers that "the title is where the
novel as language meets the novel as commodity" (181). He finally
concludes that titles are quite sensitive to the market: "As the
market expands, titles contract; as they do that, they learn to
compress meaning; and as they do that, they develop special ‘signals’
to place books in the right market niche” (204). This is an exciting
interpretation, which is borne by the various graphs of title lengths
over time, but a closer look at Moretti's language obscures the extent
to which his critical process involves interpretation at every step:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
<i>describe</i> a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
<i>try to explain</i> its causes; next, I <i>suggest</i> how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I <i>make a little attempt</i> at quantitative
stylistics, examining some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This language presents the literary critic's work as an objective
description of unproblematic reality. Additionally, although his
speculations are provocative, Moretti presents them as supplementary
to the graphs. Moretti’s diminishing language&#x2013;he describe[s], tr[ies]
to explain, suggest[s] and make[s] a little attempt&#x2013;belies the nature
of his intervention. After all, it is Moretti who poses the question,
inputs the data, and draws conclusions from the graphs. The
quantification ability of the computer emboldens Moretti to make
larger claims about literary history, all the while diminishing his
role as in analysis. His approach almost appears to aim toward
reproducing analysis to the point of automation.
</p>

<p>
With the rise of digital methods like distant reading, the faith in
the reproducible also grows, and even dominates the thinking of those
who are generally critical of distant reading in literary studies. For
example, Nan Z. Da, in her critique of scholars like Underwood, argues
that quantitative methods, which belong in scientific methodologies,
are ill-suited for literary studies. She accusses Underwood and other
distant reading practitioners for trading "speed for accuracy, and
coverage for nuance" (620). Of her many gripes with quantitative
methods, which include "technical problems, logical fallacies," and a
"fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical tools that are used and
the objects to which they are applied" (601), she emphasizes the lack
of reproducible results, the idea that one researcher's process can be
reproduced by another with identical output. She demonstrates this
lack of reproducibility with an experiment of Topic Modelling, which
is the processing of large texts in order to generate a number of
"topics" within the corpus. Researchers often use Topic Modelling as a
way of speed-reading a massive corpus to get a sense of what it is
about without having to read the text in full. Da attempts to verify
the results of a Topic Modelling experiment by replicating the process
on her own machine, a replication that fails.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> She concludes
that, "if the method were effective, someone with comparable training
should be able to use the same parameters to get basically the same
results" (628-629). This is looking over the fact that topic modeling
will return vastly different results with even slightly different
paramters,<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> for Da, reproducibility of method is a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of quantification.
</p>

<p>
This kind of reproducible criticism is where Moretti's fantasy of the
falsifiable leads. Despite their vastly different committments,
scholars like Moretti align with Da on the value that they place on
the computer: Moretti in seeking a falsifiable method; and Da in
suggesting that CLS methods fail in their goal to resemble the social
sciences. In both cases, there is a implicit faith that the computer
can do some of the analytical work that has been traditionally
ascribed to the human.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<p>
The role of paranoia in distant reading perpetuates the reproducible
approach, which blocks out other kinds of connection to
text. Moretti's method stems from a suspicious conviction that the
archive of literary history has something to hide. This project, by
contrast, looks at distant reading for how it might attend to some of
the more slippery concepts of social categories such as gender. How
might distant reading analyze gender ontology? In order to address
marginalized aspects of identity, in a way that does not reproduce our
assumptions, we have to ask questions that do not assume that we
already know the kind of thing we are looking for.
</p>

<p>
One example of distant reading explores how to handle questions of
racial identity and discourse in novels. Richard Jean So and Edwin
Roland use machine learning to explore the constructedness of racial
categories by experimenting with an algorithm that evaluates an
author's race according to the vocabulary used by the author. When
they look more closely into these results of using the algorithm on a
large corpora of novels by white and black authors, they find that it
reveals different levels of variance in words traditionally attributed
to white and black authors: while novels by white authors are
distinguished by a low variance in this vocabulary, novels by black
authors show a greater variance in vocabulary (66). They conclude that
white authorship, as a category, only coheres against the incoherence
of black authorship. In other words, they find that whiteness
<i>depends</i> on the characterization of blackness.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
So and Roland's position is that this quantitative excercise is more
useful for what it teaches us about the machine, rather than what it
teaches us about race. They decide to explore one of the errors that
the machine made, isolating one text, James Baldwin's novel,
<i>Giovanni's Room</i> (1956), which was wrongly categorized as being
written by a white author. So and Roland point out that this
misclassification recalls a critical debate about this text's
notorious elision of explicit references to race, whereby blackness is
displaced in favor of an implicit whiteness. In the six words in
<i>Giovanni's Room</i> revealed by the algorithm which influence the
categorization as a white-authored text, one of them is the term
"appalled." So and Roland point out the connotations of whiteness in
"appalled," which has the middle French root, "apalir," meaning "to
grow pale" (71). They discover that this term occurs only once in the
text, in the early scene where David (the narrator) describes his
relationship to his father. Here, David regrets his father's
friendliness which comes at the expense of a paternal aspect: "I did
not want to be his buddy. I wanted to be his son. What passed between
us as masculine candor exhausted and appalled me" (Rpt. in So and
Roland 71). They insightfully conclude that the word "appalled" in the
text marks "the moment David develops a troubled relationship to
normative masculinity [as] also the moment he becomes 'white'"
(71). Taking the computer's mistake as a starting point, their
analysis thus contributes to the ongoing debate about the imbrication
between race and sexuality in the novel.
</p>

<p>
So and Roland assert that, while "Race is a category that escapes
measurement or simply renders it untenable," the machine is an apt
tool for studying this category" (60). In a sense, So and Roland are
confronting the same problem as Da: what is the effect of
computational error in literary criticism? But rather than write off
quantitative methods, So and Roland suggest an interesting way out of
the problem: use the error as a starting point for further analysis,
which probes the constructedness of gender ontology. Because race is a
social construct, and machines only impute meaning that is encoded
into them, than it stands to reason that machines might be ideal
instruments for studying the construction of race. Computational error
becomes an opportunity for exploring the encoding of racial
identity. Looking more closely at the specific results of this
analysis, like the function of the term "appalled" in <i>Giovanni's
Room</i>, they can make more daring leaps of speculation about how
whiteness, while displacing blackness, also gestures toward a troubled
understanding of gender and potentially, sexuality. So and Roland
assert that: "If the general class of the misclassified points to the
erosion of the machine's initial binary understanding of white and
black, a close analysis of a single misclassified text can reveal what
precisely motivates that ontological undoing" (68). Thus they turn the
central mismatch between data analysis, which works to "identify and
label objects," and minority discourse analysis, which "critique[s]
and problematize[s] the very idea of categories," into a point for
interrogation (63). In this case, the algorithm allows researchers to
interrogate how whiteness as a category depends on the contrast of
blackness as "other." Rather than being "fundamentally mismatched,"
the machine and minority discourse are particularly suited for one
another, as the machine uses highly constructed and reductive method
that allows practitioners to deconstruct social categories.
</p>

<p>
The example with "appalled" is totally idiosyncratic&#x2013;the word occurs
once through the entire novel. But paying attention to error upends
the value of reproducibility by combining a deconstructive and
speculative approach. The researchers run a computation, look for an
error, and use that error as an opportunity to learn about the ways
that categories are constructed. They are using computers in an
unintuitive way, computing for indeterminacy.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-4">
<p>
Using quantitative analysis to study gender in literary texts is not a
new endeavor. One prominent distant reading practitioner, Ted
Underwood, studies the way that gender markers in novels change over
time. Underwood's method deploys statistical modelling, in which a
sample of data is used to make predictions about larger groups of
data. He uses machine learning, or programs "trained" by certain data
sets, to create models that can then make predictions on other
datasets. Underwood's aim to to measure how effective computers are at
analyzing certain textual elements based on previous analyses. He
calls his approach "perspectival modelling." He explains that, "Since
learning algorithms rely on examples rather than fixed definitions,
they can be used to model the tacit assumptions shared by particular
communities of production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human
Perspective" 93). In a review of Underwood's work, Dan Sinykin writes
that "Against the purported objectivity of algorithms, he leverages
the human prejudices built into modeling toward humanistic ends"
(par. 4).<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
One of Underwood's projects examines gender roles in novels from the
18th century to the 21st century by using a model that predicts the
the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated with
that character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on&#x2013;excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like <i>boyhood</i> or <i>wife</i>. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. <i>Distant Horizons</i> 115
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In simplest terms, the program studies some given adjectives
associated with a male or female character in order to make
predictions about other characters' genders. Inevitably, the resulting
output is always determined by this initial input. Underwood carefully
asserts that these models suggest, not the truth of gender ontology,
but the approaches and choices made by those who create the models:
"Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and
rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence
used to train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
92). This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles
in novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 114). The graph shows a steady
overlapping of words traditionally associated with women, such as
"heart," with words typically assoicated with men, like "passion,"
toward the middle of the 20th century. One of the many explanations
for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice of writing
becomes more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the middle of
the 20th century than it was previously (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 137). This
fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about men than
women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline in
female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly paradoxical
conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while the actual
prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be possible.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/Underwood.png" alt="Underwood.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
There are two important things to point out about Underwood's
analysis. First is that his specific method for text analysis is
logistic regression analysis, which is made for modelling binary
variables. A logistic regression expresses information in the form of
a probability, often between yes/no, pass/fail, win/lose, etc. In
Underwood's case, the probability is male/female. The output therefore
conforms to this binary model. Second, beyond the methodology, there
is a larger issue with the question that Underwood poses, for the
results the results of Underwood's "perspectival modeling" can only be
as good as the questions he asks. From a critical gender perspective,
Underwood's question imposes the very structure that he is attempting
to deconstruct. In other project where he similarly measures the
"transformations" of gender across time periods, he explains that
simplification is necessary ("Machine Learnig and Human Perspective"
93):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Underwood admits that he needs a "simple" model in order to bring into
relation the dynamics of gender (See Fig. 2).<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup> In aiming for
simplicity, however, he underestimates the extent to which his initial
assumptions will affect the final result. Although he considers the
possibility that he finds a structural tension between gender "because
[he] explores gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition"
(<i>Distant Horizons</i> 140), he neglects to consider how the collapsing
of gender into a single graph perpetuates the structural categories of
male/female in a way that neglects the assumptions behind such a
category.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup> The issue is not just with the assumptions at the
outset which reproduces the result, but with the guiding question of
the entire project, which is not about deconstructing gender, but
about reifying it. Asking a machine to replicate the conscription of
gender as male/female for the purpose of seeing how male and female
roles in novels change over time only creates a model of gender that
is "simple" enough to be computed by the system. 
</p>

<p>
How does simplifying the concept of gender contribute to our study of
it? This is not to say that there aren't ways of opening up our
understanding of gender by exploring it as a binary system. However,
Underwood's approach seeks a singular answer to the question of gender
roles. From this perspective, gender is a problem with an answer, an
answer that can be reproduced and verified. Underwood himself states:
"the data I can legally provide &#x2013; lists of word frequencies
associated with each volume or fictional character &#x2013; should allow
intrepid readers to retrace the most debatable parts of the
argument. An argument that can be retraced in this manner is
'reproducible'" (Underwood, <i>Distant Horizons</i> 173). He continues, "If
my conclusions hold true in different subsets of the literary past,
they are not just reproducible but 'replicable'" (Underwood, <i>Distant
Horizons</i> 174). This is an important example of how paranoid reading
can trap one in what Sedgwick describes as a "binary mode of
thinking," where textual elements are conscripted into meaning one
thing or the other (<i>Touching Feeling</i> 2).

<h4 id="org1ea84b5"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.5</span> Mandell: deconstructing/multiplying gender</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-5">
<p>
Laura Mandell explores solutions for approaching the reduction of
gender as data, into what she calls the "M/F binary."<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup> Mandell
demonstrates how the M/F binary is reified "by presenting conclusions
about “male” and “female” modes of thinking and writing as if the M/F
terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently
referential and not discursively constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's
examination marshalls key findings from feminist theory, drawing from
Judith Butler, among others, to assert that gender is a socially
constituted category, a "performance" that can be historicized. She
illustrates the guiding power of the M/F binary in her critique of
Jockers and Rybicki, which find that they essentialize gender by
relying on stereotypes in their premises.
</p>

<p>
Mandell uses stylometry, as well as word-frequency analysis, and topic
modeling to examine gender in writing. Such methods are often used in
assessing authorship and authenticity, and stylometry in particular
predates computing and has notable cases in English Renaissance drama
and biblical texts. Generally, stylometry evaluates writing style by
extracting and analysing distinctive features in text. Often used in
stylometry, word-frequency analysis examines word usage to determine
authorship of a text. Topic modeling, as explained above, is the
generation of categories or "topics" about text. Mandell uses the
popular stylometry measurement, "Burrow's Delta," which visualizes the
"distance" between writing styles by creating branches (or "deltas")
between different texts. Specifically, Mandell's analysis focuses on
the "most frequent, little words (“a,” “of,” “the”), as well as
keywords." 
</p>

<p>
Mandell suggests that quantitative methods can open up the way we
deconstruct our understanding of quantification and gender. She points
out that gender, which is "constructed both by the measurer and the
measured," is never just about gender, but contains multiple
assumptions. To demonstrate how gender is "constructed," she poses a
counter experiment with genre, which finds that genre analysis cuts
across the gender binary. She comapres the stylistic qualities of a
female writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, against two male writers,
William Godwin and Samuel Johnson, revealing that: "Wollstonecraft’s
sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble Godwin’s sentimental
anti-Jacobin novels&#x2026; whereas her essays most resemble Johnson’s
writings" (par. 29). Wollenstonecraft's writing resembles both male
and female writing, depending on the genre. To analyze the highly
constructed category of "gender," then, one must also consider genre:
"separating gender from other markings (genre, era of composition) is
not possible: historical time and genre are not incidental to, but
constitutive of, gender" (par. 35).
</p>

<p>
Admitting the constructed nature of gender allows researchers "to
experiment with new taxonomies of gender" (par. 37). Most usefuly,
Mandell's work points out how the computer is ideal for drawing
attention to the multiplicity of gender. The potential for complex
data models potentially allows researchers to "break the strength of
the signal" in the M/F binary by creating new categories, such as
"'men writing as men,' 'women writing as women,' 'women writing as
men,' 'men writing as women,' 'unspecified (anonymous) writing as
men,'" and so on (par. 35). Moreover, her emphasis on visualization
and movement inform how one might "animate numerical processes rather
than fixing their results as stereotype" (par. 7). The dynamicity of
computation, which allows one to run data iteratively, feeding new
inputs into new results, complicates any straighforward understanding
of the M/F binary. Mandell explains that “Computer screens&#x2026; afford
the fluid exploration of parameters and taxonomies, through which many
sorts of experiments can be tested: interactive visualizations can
give us not objective answers rooted in aggressively reductive
oppositions, but parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very
complex reality” (par. 38).
</p>

<p>
However, Mandell's emphasis on how genre helps to constitute gender
overlooks a crucial aspect about gender&#x2013;that it is highly
constitutive, in turn, of subjectivity. The similarities that Mandell
draws between gender and genre evacuate how gender is <i>constitutive</i>
of the subject. Borrowing from Butler, she argues that both gender and
genre are a performance "are&#x2026; highly imitable" (par. 30), and
asserts that "Anyone can adopt gendered modes of behavior, just as
anyone can write in genres stereotypically labeled M/F"
(par.30). Here, she takes Butler's points about gender as a
performance in <i>Gender Trouble</i> too literally. As Butler clarifies in
her later work, performativity is a process which is compulsory and
habitual, rather than a singular act. Crucially, Butler asserts that
gender <i>precedes</i> and <i>constitutes</i> the subject. In <i>Bodies that
Matter</i>, her follow-up to <i>Gender Trouble</i>, Butler explicitly warns
against the interpretation that gender is decided by the subject, to
be put on and off at will like clothing. Rather, according to Butler,
the subject <i>is produced</i> by gender; gender is more like a mechanism
that allows the subject to emerge: "construction is neither a subject
nor its act, but a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and
'acts' come to appear at all" (xviii). This is not to say that Mandell
is wrong about gender being constructed, but that her assumption, that
"categories such as gender are being constructed both by the measurer
and the measured" misses an important point about the way that gender
constitutes subjectivity (par. 38). According to Butler, the subject
only emerges as an effect of gendered performance. To analyze gender,
one might look at the ways that it constitutes and constrains
subjectivity.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-6">
<p>
This aspect about gender being constitutive has a generative parallel
to computation. As Mandell points out, "Computation enables
complexity" (par. 36). And computation, like gender, is also highly
constrained. There are rules and protocols that govern the way that
text is processed and analyzed. 
</p>

<p>
Computation and gender, as highly constrained, can be mutually
enlightening. They can allow us to explore the formal characteristics
of each&#x2013;seeing constraint in the forms of different data models,
visualizations, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Computation is ideal for deconstruction. As So and Roland demonstrate
with the categories of white and black authorship, the limitations of
computation help point out the bounds of social categories as a
constructed phenomenoa.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, computation might work within the frame of
speculation. This kind of work would explore the constraints of gender
and computation as enabling constraints. Quantitative methods deal
with the unknown: "the point of numbers in social science is not to
impose determinism but to acknowledge uncertainty" (Underwood,
<i>Distant Horizons</i> 186) While the work of So and Roland is essential
for bringing together quantitative and critical race discourses, it
also doesn't give enough credit to the ways that <i>computers</i>, in
presenting formalized schemas of race, <i>transform</i> data toward
speculative ends. What if we began with the error? What if, in
addition to using the machine to study human constructs, we used the
machine to spur human thinking? This chapter takes exactly this
approach to study the marginalized aspects of gender ontology. This
chapter looks for ways that Digital Humanists might deploy text
analysis for the study of gender. In doing so, it draws from the
speculative and computationally critical approaches of digital
humaninists like Ramsay, Drucker, and from the attention to
deconstructing social categories from So, Roland, and Mandell. How do
we take what these theorists are doing with text analysis and apply it
toward the study of gender? We need a method that attends to the
particularity of gender construction and ontology.
</p>

<p>
If we are going to analyze gender, we must consider how it constitutes
and constrains other elements in the text. In applying digital tools
to the study of gender, we ought to be wary of the temptation to
approach gender as a secretive element of the text. How do we approach
the study of gender in a way that avoids the pitfalls of a paranoid
stance? To avoid this paranoid position, we might look to engage with
gender as an aestheticized quality, as something that operates on the
surface of the text, without conscripting it into the logic of
"prohibition and repression," in Sedgwick's words (<i>Touching Feeling</i>
10). I turn to distant reading, not to help reveal what is invisibly
encoded in my text of study, but for the ways that it allows me to
re-read the surface of the text. Moving forward, the question is&#x2013;How
can we read gender not by what it hides, but what it shows? This
chapter proposes a method of reading that grapples with the tension to
unearth hidden, latent, or absent meaning in text. The stakes are
about preserving the role of the aesthetics in critique. How can the
reconfiguration&#x2013;the abstraction&#x2013;provided by the machine allow us to
engage with queerness in texts?

This section now turns to the programming language Python to get a
closer look at how text analysis works through constraint. We will
look into the material specificity of text analysis, to examine how it
works, and through what processes and protocols.
</p>

<p>
Many distant reading projects use a tool called Python to do
computational analysis. Python is a general purpose programming
language applicable toward many tasks and projects, from publishing
websites, to managing and analyzing large data sets (both textual and
numeric data), to deep learning and artificial intelligence. The
emphasis on readability in Python's code vocabulary and syntax make it
a relatively straightforward programming language which is easier to
pick up than other comparable languages. Most beginners can jump into
the python syntax and intuit a sense of the code simply by reading it
left to right. For example, an expression called the <code>for loop</code>
consists of six words over two lines, and that instructs Python to do
something to each item in a group of data. In more technical terms,
the <code>for loop</code> offers a mechanism for iterating (or "looping") through
data, and carrying out some specified action to each peice of
data. The <code>for loop</code> consists of the following expression:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
</p>

</div>

<p>
The first line of code specificies the data (<code>hello</code>), and the
second line (<code>print(letter)</code>) instructs the computer to print each
letter in the word. Essentially, this loop will go through each item
in the data, in this case, each letter in the word <code>hello</code>, and it
will <code>print</code> or display that data.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup> The the output will appear
thus:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
h
e
l
l
o
</p>

</div>

<p>
These kinds of iterative computations, which are central to
programming tasks, are a core component of working with text. At a
very basic level, much of text analysis consists of iterating over
bits of text and doing something to each bit. 
</p>

<p>
A major benefit to a popular programming languages like Python is that
users have developed a number of custom "libraries," or collections of
code, which are tailor-made for specific tasks like web scraping (or
downloading website data), data analysis (such statistical modeling),
and text analysis, or the quantitative analysis of textual data. In
text analysis, there are a number of libraries for Natural Language
Processing (NLP), or the processing of linguistic data into
computational formats. The most popular NLP library in python is the
Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK). This library is popular with
beginners because it comes packaged with a corpus of texts that are
ready to analyze, like Hermen Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i> (1851) and Jane
Austen's <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> (1811). Additionally, if using their
own texts, users can use NLTK methods like <code>tokenize</code> or <code>lemmatize</code>,
which is functionally for processing a text from its oringal format,
often a <code>string</code> data type (that is, alphanumeric characters in
sequential order) into a separated, clean, and regularized form. NLTK
also contains useful analytical methods such <code>similar</code>, which will
generate a list of words that are "similar," or appear in similar
contexts, to the chosen word, or <code>concordance</code>, which will give the
"context," or a list of all the immediate words surrounding a chosen
word. For example, below is a concordance of from Austen's <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i> for the word "woman":
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">

</p>

</div>

<p>
This tool allows users to examine the context surrounding the chosen
word, "woman." In other words, we see some of the text that comes
immediately before and after the chosen word. This <code>concordance</code>
method is related in its process to another one, <code>similar</code>, which also
uses word context to calculate its output. The result for running
<code>similar</code> on the word "woman" in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> are the
following:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
man way year moment word men letter friend person gentleman living
situation part lady wife child time thing little day
</p>

</div>

<p>
To compute <code>similar</code> terms, NLTK takes the context of the term from
<code>concordance</code>, then it searches the text for other terms that contain
similar contexts. In other words, the <code>similar</code> method searches the
text for words that appear <i>similarly</i> to the chosen word. It is a
useful strategy for getting a sense of which words are treated in
comaprable ways across the text.
</p>


<p>
In order to run methods like <code>concordance</code> and <code>similar</code>, however, the
text needs to be ready for analysis. That means undertaking a series
of preprocessing tasks like tokenizing, cleaning and regularizing the
text. Tokenizing the text means separating it into units like words
and punctuation. Tokenizing the text essentially turns a long string
of characters into workable units, makes it easier to clean and
regularize. NLTK offers a method for tokenizing:
<code>nltk.word_tokenize()</code>. Running this method on the text of Virginia
Woolf's <i>Orlando</i> turns the novel into a list of words and
punctuation. The following is the first sentence of the novel in
tokenized format:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
['He', '&#x2013;', 'for', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'no', 'doubt', 'of',
'his', 'sex', ',', 'though', 'the','fashion', 'of', 'the', 'time',
'did', 'something' 'to', 'disguise', 'it', '&#x2013;', 'was', 'in','the',
'act', 'of', 'slicing', 'at', 'the', 'head', 'of', 'a', 'Moor',
'which', 'swung', 'from','the', 'rafters', '.' ]
</p>

</div>

<p>
Once the text is tokenized, then it can be cleaned. Cleaning the text
involves stripping it of capitalized letters and punctuation, such as
"&#x2013;" and ",", and removing what are called "stop words," or
prepositions, articles, and related terms, which include, "he," "for,"
"there," "be," "of," "the," and "did." Punctuation and stop words are
often removed because tend to skew or slow results of analysis due to
their high frequency and low semantic value. Using python's brevity,
we can clean and remove punctuation with just one line of code:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
lower<sub>no</sub><sub>punct</sub> = [word.lower() for word in tokens if word.isalpha()]
</p>

</div>

<p>
This expression will remove all punctuation from the text and
transform any upper case letters into lower case ones. Reading from
left to right, it first creates an empty list, called
<code>lower_no_punct</code>. Then, for each word in the text, it makes the word
entirely lowercase, and if that word is alphabetic (meaning it
contains no numbers or punctuation), it will be added to the empty
list. Python expressions like this one, which are contained within
brackets on a single line, are called "list comprehensions." A list
comprehension is formatted as follows: a variable to store the final
data (<code>lower_no_punct</code>) set to an expression that specifies what to do
for each word in the text. The list comprehension is a kind of
condensed loop, which goes through each item in a list of items (such
as each word in a text) and does something to that item. The same
expression can be written in a more informative way by making use of
nested structures. For example:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
lower<sub>no</sub><sub>punct</sub> = []
for word in tokens:
    if word.isalpha():
        lower<sub>no</sub><sub>punct.append</sub>(word.lower())
</p>

</div>

<p>
Here, we begin again by creating an empty list, <code>lower_no_punct</code>, into
which we will drop our words after filtering through them. The next
line begins our <code>for loop</code>, which iterates through each word in the
<code>tokens</code> list of words. The third line creates the condition for the
to have only alphabetic characters in our <code>lower_no_punct</code> list. If
the word passes that condition, then we go to the fourth line, which
will add that word to the <code>lower_no_punct</code> list. At the same time that
this word is added to this list, all the letters will be transformed
to lowercase format. The final list will contain words that are all
lowercase and contain no punctuation.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will remove stop words. To do this, we can use another list
comprehension:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
no<sub>stops</sub> = [word for word in lower<sub>no</sub><sub>punct</sub> if word not in stops]
</p>

</div>

<p>
Similarly to the above example, this expression takes each word in a
list, in this case, <code>lower_no_punct</code>, and checks to see if that word
is also contained within the list of stop words in <code>stops</code>. If the
word is <i>not</i> a stop word, then it will be added to a new list,
<code>no_stops</code>.  Once this is done, we can take a peek into the first
several words on the cleaned text. We are now left with a list of
words that are all lowercase, without punctuation or stop words:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafters']
</p>

</div>

<p>
After cleaning the text in this way, we can move on to regularization,
which includes lemmatizing. Lematizing is the process of stripping the
grammatical structure to get the word root. In some cases, this
involves cutting off the endings, or affixes, from the word, for
example, "rafters" will be stripped to "rafter." In other cases,
however, it involves looking up a word in a reference to find the
appropriate root. After running the lemmatizer through our text, the
first sentence appears thus:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafter']
</p>

</div>

<p>
There are two aspects about the cleaning and regularizing process that
merit further scrutiny: the first is recursion. The entire process is
highly recursive, doing the same action to each item to the list of
words that make up the text. The logic of the code reinforces this
recursiveness, especially in the loop which iterates through items in
a list, doing the same thing repeatedly to each item. Additionally,
the code's nested expressions reinforce recursion, as each line
specifies another action to be performed on each word. For example, in
the following code block, the first line isolates a word from the
list, the second line checks if that word contains only alphabetic
characters, and the third transforms that word to lowercase. Each of
the three lines performs an additional task on the same word. 
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
for word in tokens:
    if word.isalpha():
        word.lower()
</p>

</div>

<p>
The second notable aspect about the cleaning and regularizing process
is reduction. The act of cleaning and regularizing, often called
"preprosessing," forces words into existing boxes, so to speak, in
order to make them amenable to analysis. The effect of this
preprocessing strips text of semantic meaning, which can be contained
in capitalized words, rhythms of language in stop words, inflections
in word endings, and so on. That preprocessing potentially strips
meaning from words doesn’t mean that it ought to be avoided, but that
the researcher ought to be aware of how certain textual reductions
have the potential to affect meaning. For example, the removal of
stopwords from <i>Orlando</i>'s opening sentence strips the immensely
meaningful first word "He," which asserts the gender of the
protagonist. It also cuts the following em dash, which leads to an
interruption that immediately qualifies the previous assertion "&#x2013;for
there could be no doubt of his sex&#x2013;." The novel opens with this
assertive gender designation, followed by an immediate qualification
of this designation, which is expressed entirely in stopwords and
punctuation. Such data would be removed in preprocessing.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
These critics all approach the interaction between reader and text as
a peformative phenomenon. They discuss the event of the analysis,
"playing the text", making "cuts" into the data. By contrast, the
aspect of performativity that gender theorists like Judith Butler
emphasize is that of repetition, signification, and
re-signification. Butler performativity as a repetitive activity,
constrained by regulatory norms, which produces subjects. Although
performativity regulates subjects toward heteronormative practices, it
can also be coopted into subversion. In the process of repetition,
subjects have the possibility of resignifying meaning by producing it
differently. This resignification allows subjects to work within their
limitations to resist dominant structures while maintaining their own
sense of exclusion without being coopted. In other words, they can be
in the system but not of the system.
</p>

<p>
In her groundbreaking book, <i>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity</i> (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts
popular theorizations about sex and gender in contemporary feminist
thought: namely, that sex is biological while gender is constructed;
and that the gender, as a construction, is a self-expression of the
subject. According to Butler, sex and gender are both social
constructions, and there is no such thing as a stable gender identity,
or even a subject that exists prior to gender expression. Rather,
Butler argues that gender is performative&#x2013;it is a series of repeated
acts by which the subject enacts gender by "citing" heteronormative
regulatory schemas. It is through the process of enacting gender that
the subject emerges. In her follow up book, <i>Bodies That Matter</i>
(1995), Butler further delineates the process of gender
performativity, where what is experienced as the physical body, its
boundaries and its sexuality, only materialize through the repetition
or “citation” of cultural norms. Her concept of "citation" emphasizes
the iterability of the performative practice, whereby each action
"cites" or implicitly signals an authorizing norm. According to
Butler, performance consists of this habit of citation, the ongoing
process of submitting behavior to a regulatory norm.
</p>

<p>
Here, Butler's central concern is to explore how language and the body
engage. Specifically, Butler wonders whether language can indicate a
body that has not yet been imbued with meaning, a body "prior to
signification" (6). She wonders, "Can language simply refer to
materiality, or is language also the very condition under which
materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Butler finds that language
cannot refer to a pre-existing materiality&#x2013;for to refer to the body,
language must first posit that body, and in the positing, it assumes
meaning. Therefore, she reason, the signification of the body actually
creates the body: "This signification produces as an <i>effect</i> of its
own procedure the very body that it nevertheless and simultaneously
claims to discover as that which <i>precedes</i> its own action"
(6). Language, rather than reflect a prior reality, actually works to
<i>produce</i> signification. Butler's point here draws from feminst
theorist Luce Irigaray who argues that language in fact creates
knowledge, as in her famous statement about female sexuality, which
"has always been conceptualized on the basis of masculine parameters"
(Irigaray, <i>The Sex Which Is Not One</i> 23). Butler points out that "the
mimetic or representational status of language&#x2026;. is not mimetic at
all. On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even
argue performative" (6). In other words, language produces the reality
that it claims to merely reference. So, in the process of citation,
which is the ongoing re-signification that cites regulatory norms such
as gender norms, subjects are always interpellated by a discourse
prior to their citing it. This productive quality of language will be
central to the ways that language offers a way out of the
significatory circle.
</p>

<p>
Butler asks, "What would it mean to cite a law to produce it
differently, to 'cite' the law in order to reiterate and coopt its
power?" (xxiii). For, amid this regulatory structure, in which the
subject comes into being by continually citing the norm, lies the
possibility of resignifying that citation. Because language transcends
a representative function, because it has the ability to <i>produce</i>
meaning, language can be resignified toward subversive usages by
<i>citing the repudiated signification</i>. Butler offers an example in the
resignification of the term "queer," which has been transformed from a
term of abjection to one of empowerment. "Queer" achieves this
signification by harnessing its own repudiation, which Butler explains
is implied by every identification, a "disavowed abjection [which]
will threaten to expose the self-grounding presumptions of the sexed
subject" (3). By identifying with heterosexuality, one repudiates
homosexuality, the "Queer," which will remain as a threat to the
identification. Butler proposes that one marshall this repudiation as
a resource in resignification: "to consider this threat and
disruption&#x2026; as a critical resource in the struggle to articulate the
very terms of symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility" (3). Here, the
concept of "citation" is crucial, for each signification "cites" or
draws from the authorizing power. One can cite a norm in order to
disrupt the significatory power of that norm. So, the term "queer," in
its public assertion, "enacts performativity as citationality for the
purposes of resignifying the abjection of homosexuality into defiance
and legitimacy" (xxviii). Each time the term is used, it draws from
the domain of abjection, the repudiation, in a way that re-signifies
because it fails to repeat the meaning loyally, because it signifies
that meaning differently. For Butler, then, the central problem of
being stuck in the cycle of signification is also the solution. Butler
takes on language as something that can be productive, that can
resignify meaning, as the option available to those who are trapped
within the signification system.
</p>

<p>
An exploration of Luce Irigaray's writing style demonstrates how this
process of resignification can take place in language. First, Butler
establishes how significatory systems exclude that which they claim to
signify. Irigaray takes Jacques Derrida's concept of phallogocentrism,
or that man, symbolized by the phallus, is the center and focus of
knowledge, as a lens for reading Plato and Aristotle's discussion of
form/matter or bodies/souls binaries. Irigaray demonstrates how these
binaries, which take the category of "woman," associated with "matter"
(materiality, the mother) and set it subordinate to male "form"
(mastering rationality) actually erase the possibility of representing
woman at all. In fact, the binary that claims to represent the
feminine as the subordinated term in masculine/feminine binaries,
actually "produces the feminine as that which must be excluded for
that economy to operate" (10). Because "binary oppositions are
formulated through the exclusion of a field of disruptive
possibilities"(10), the feminine is "domesticated" (13). The
nonfigured feminine remains excessive, outside the terms of the
binary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One cannot interpret the philosophical relation to the feminine
through the figures that philosophy provides, but, rather, she argues,
through siting the feminine as the unspeakable condition of
figuration, as that which, in fact, can never be figured within the
terms of philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is
its enabling condition. 12
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What Butler calls the <i>excessive</i> feminine is excluded, or cast out,
as "the necessary outside," which allows the <i>specular</i> feminine to
take its place in the binary. According to Butler, we cannot know what
the feminine consists of without subscribing it to
phallogocentrism. If the feminine is outside the system, and cannot be
figured, how can it be known? Butler aptly questions, "For how can one
read a text for what does <i>not</i> appear within its own terms, but which
nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own
legibility?" (11). For Butler, this is the key question&#x2013;how do we
work with what we are given to express what is not there, what is
refused by the system of the visible?
</p>

<p>
The answer is through repetition and reworking&#x2013;resignification
through performative citation. Butler explains that Irigaray achieves
this resignification by miming language: "she mimes philosophy&#x2026; and,
in the mime, takes on a language that effectively cannot belong to
her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use citation as a strategy of
repeating what Plato says with the goal of undermining his authority:
"She cites Plato again and again, but the citations expose precisely
what is excluded from them, and seek to show and to reintroduce the
excluded into the system itself" (18). Through repetition, Irigaray
displaces the logic of phallogocentrism, introducing something
external to the system while remaining within its terminology. Butler
affirms that "Her miming has the effect of repeating the origin only
to displace that origin as an origin" (18). Her repetition is a way of
infiltrating the logic of phallogocentrism on its own terms. Butler
herself mimes what might have been Irigaray's internal monologue:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Deception through resemblance; insubordination through subservience;
displacement through repetition&#x2013;these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
As I previously examined NLTK for how it guides and constrains
analysis, I now turn to looking at <i>gender as a constraint</i> in
Virginia Woolf's novel, <i>Orlando: A Biography</i>. In what follows, I
will demonstrate how gender functions as an <i>enabling constraint</i> in
Virginia Woolf's text, <i>Orlando: A Biography</i>, to examine how the
phenomenon of gender guides and influences subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Orlando</i> is a fictional biography that follows the life of the
eponymous 16th-century English nobleman as he undergoes a sex change
and lives into the 20th century as a woman. In this text, gender is
linked to the role of language in the way that they both activate
significatory power. My reading explores how the beginning of the
novel displays the common struggle between gender and language for for
expression. I then point out key moments where the novel approaches
gender through the prism of language, specifically in the tension
between plain language and poetic language as experienced by Orlando
as he develops into a poet and by the biographer-narrator, who
repeatedly disclaims literary and figurative strategies of narration
while striving for an objective portrayal of Orlando's life. Then, I
show how Orlando's sex change begins to resolve his struggle with
language, and therefore, gender. As Orlando settles into her new
gender, she finds new significatory power in language. At the same
time, the biographer is freed to explore more experimental forms for
telling Orlando's story.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the story, Orlando falls in love with a young
Russian princess named Sasha. The scene of this romance is an
important moment where gender is explored in relation to language,
because Orlando cannot resolve either one. When he first sees Sasha,
she is skating over the frozen river Thames, and he cannot ascertain
if she is a man or a woman from her skilled atheleticism and exotic
manner of dress. He proceeds to describe her using seemingly arbitrary
metaphors&#x2013;another significatory attempt that also fails:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
He beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him
with the highest curiosity. The person, whatever the name or sex, was
about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed entirely in
oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar greenish-coloured
fur. But these details were obscured by the extraordinary
seductiveness which issued from the whole person. Images, metaphors of
the most extreme and extravagant twined and twisted in his mind. He
called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an emerald, and a fox
in the snow all in the space of three seconds; he did not know whether
he had heard her, tasted her, seen her, or all three together. (For
though we must pause not a moment in the narrative we may here hastily
note that all his images at this time were simple in the extreme to
match his senses and were mostly taken from things he had liked the
taste of as a boy. But if his senses were simple they were at the same
time extremely strong. To pause therefore and seek the reasons of
things is out of the question.)&#x2026; A melon, an emerald, a fox in the
snow&#x2013;so he raved, so he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must
be&#x2013;no woman could skate with such speed and vigour&#x2013;swept almost on
tiptoe past him, Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that
the person was of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the
question. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This passage expresses a mounting sense of tension as Orlando grows
more and more frustrated with Sasha's gender ambiguity. Interestingly,
his growing frustration seems to feed his attraction, as with each
doubt Orlando appears more and more desperate, "ready to tear his hair
with vexation." The biographer's role in the narrative unfolding of
this scene also has an effect: the syntax alternates long and short
sentences in a way that draws out the cyclical quality of Orlando's
confused mental state. There is also a "pause" in the action, where
the biographer adds another layer of speculation to Orlando's already
conflicted inner life, while simultaneously drawing attention to the
constructed quality of the narrative. While the tension is mounting
throughout the passage, the relationship between gender and language
come to the fore. The biographer's aside, which describes how the
difficulty of placing gender emerges in the difficulty with language&#x2013;
"He called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an
emerald"&#x2013;emphasizes the connection between gender and the
imagination. Intrestingly, at the same time that Orlando cannot place
Sasha's gender, he also cannot find the right words to describe
her. As the Sasha's probable gender oscillates between male and female
throughout passage, and Orlando's desire crescendos, gender seems
primed to signify imaginative beyond biological species, nevermind
sex. The effect of the narrative style in this section is to mirror
with language the tortuous thought process that Orlando undergoes as
he guesses then doubts the reality of Sasha's gender. As the passage
continues, the suspense comes to a climax:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a
boy's, but no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those
breasts; no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from
the bottom of the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping a
curtsey with the utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past on
the arm of some Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a
standstill. She was not a handsbreadth off. She was a woman. 27-28
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, this narrative structure reinforces Orlando's ambivalence about
Sasha's gender ambiguity. The sentences ebb and flow as Orlando
finally settles on Sasha's gender&#x2013;"she was a woman." Gender is an
element that functions within the story, as something that Orlando
struggles to grasp, in this case, with language. The biographer's
narrative style here, which depicts Orlando's struggle with gender via
langauge, add another layer of language experimentation in the form of
his narrative style. This scene scene shows how if gender is
ambiguous, then language is also imprecise.
</p>


<p>
As Orlando's relationship with Sasha ends with deceit and desertion,
he succumbs to a long, deep depression that brings him to doubt both
what he had previously been most moved by: love and poetry&#x2013;"Thys, at
the age of thirty, or thereabouts, this young Nobleman had not only
had every experience that life has to offer, but had seen the
worthlessness of them all. Love and ambition, women and poets were all
equally vain. Literature was a farce" (71). At this time, Orlando
begins to doubt language's ability to convey truth. In one scene, he
struggles both with objective or "plain" language, and with poetic
language, by attempting to describe the color of the grass and the
sky:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'The sky is blue,' he said, 'the grass is green.' Looking up, he saw
that, on the contrary, the sky is like the veils which a thousand
Madonnas have let fall from their hair; and the grass fleets and
darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs
from enchanted woods. 'Upon my word,' he said (for he had fallen into
the bad habit of speaking aloud), 'I don't see that one's more true
than another. Both are utterly false.' And he despaired of being able
to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into
a deep dejection. 75
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Orlando cannot comprehend whether plain english, where he can say
simply that "the sky is blue; the grass is green" is preferable to a
more figurative language, which makes use of similitude and allusion:
"the sky is like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall
from their hair; the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls
fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods". For
Orlando, both plain and figurative language appear deficient. At this
point in the story, he has lost his faith in the power of language to
signify. 
</p>

<p>
The struggle with language operates at two levels across the story: At
the same time that Orlando has his doubts about language, so the
biographer grapples with his narrative project. At the start of the
story, the biographer mocks the techniques of historical biographers
by continualling calling into question the ability of language to
adequately describe life. An early passage begins with the narrator
noting Orlando's exquisite beauty: "A more candid, sullen face it
would be impossible to find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still
the biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex
herself, nor he invoke the help of novelist or poet" (12). From the
beginning, the text displays the biographer's ambivalence about how to
describe Orlando and presents two possible perspectives&#x2013;that of the
poet, and that of the biographer.The biographer asserts his aims are
to record Orlando as a scribe, "following after" him, "from deed to
deed, from glory to glory, from office to office" (12). But then, as the
passage progresses, the narrator relies on figuration:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The red of the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on
the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The
lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an
exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in
its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted
closely to the head. But [..] directly we glance at Orlando standing
by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets,
so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened
them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between
the two blank medallions which were his temples. Directly we glance at
eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes
and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is
the aim of every good biographer to ignore. 12-13
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Honoring his committment for straightforward narration, the
description of Orlando's face begins soberly enough with simple
sentence structure that describe Orlando's features with some
insertion of modest figurative comparisons (the "peach down" ob the
lips, teeth of "an exquisite and almond whiteness," the "tense flight"
of the "arrowy nose," etc). However, when the biographer arrives to
Orlando's eyes and forehead, his style ascends into full-fledged
figuration, admitting Orlando has eyes "like drench'd violets." The
biographer's problem, that Orlando is too beautiful for literal
description requires him to draw on the strategies of the poet, using
imagery and simile. Further in the story, in the chapter of Orlando's
sex change, the biographer again falls back onto poetic strategies to
tell Orlando's story. The biographer begins this chapter by laying out
the challenge of describing Orlando's life in a way that is objective
and literal, in keeping with the principles of biography. As he tries
to piece together the events of Orlando's sex change, the biographer
explains that the record of Orlando’s life during this period is
incomplete, because a fire broke out and destroyed much of the
evidence: "Just when we thought to elucidate a secret that has puzzled
historians for a hundred years, there was a hole in the manuscript big
enough to put your finger through&#x2026; often it has been necessary to
speculate, to surmise, and even to use the imagination" (88). The
biographer explains that he must work from fragments, and that his
work involves the use of speculation, much like a 
</p>

<p>
Orlando's relationship to language begins to change as she transitions
from male to female. The relationship to language begins with the
narrator, who is the first to assert the change in gender pronouns:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We may take advantage of this pause in the narrative to make certain
statements. Orlando had become a woman&#x2013;there is no denying it. Bu tin
every other respect, Orlando remained precisely as he had been. The
change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to
alter their identity. Their faces remained, as their portraits prove,
practically the same. His memory&#x2013;but in future, we must for
convention's sake, say 'her' for 'his;' and 'she' for 'he'&#x2013;her memory
then, went back through all the events of her past life without
encountering any obstacle. 102-103
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the narrator cycles through the pronouns "he," "they," "she," in
a way that shows how language lags behind gender. The biographer's
language is catching up to the reality of Orlando's new gender. This
is an example, quite literal, of how language struggles to represent
gender, how it is just behind the expression of gender.
</p>

<p>
After the sex change, Orlando meets and marries a gender ambiguous man
named Shel. As Orlando falls in love with Shel, her issues with
language begin to resolve. She has an experience where language
suddenly takes on significatory power. In a scene that revises a prior
one of the young, heartbroken Orlando attempting to describe the color
of the sky and the grass, Orlando is now in Hyde Park, watching a toy
boat negotiate a wavelet on the Serpentine river. Momentarily, the
boat is dissapears then re-emerges on the other side of the
wavelet. Suddenly associating this moment with the word "ecstasy,"
Orlando hurries to telegram the phrase, 'a toy boat on the serpentine'
and 'ecstasy,' to Shel, who she knows will immediately understand what
it means. As she goes to the post office, she meditates on the nature
of language and literature, which she now realizes is violently
ecstatic.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,' she repeated, thus enforcing upon
herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor
eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter; it's
something useless, sudden, violent; something that costs a life; red,
blue, purple; a spirit; a splash; like those hyacinths (she was passing a
fine bed of them); free from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or
care for one's kind; something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth,
husband I mean, Bonthrop: that's what it is&#x2013;a toy boat on the
Serpentine, ecstasy&#x2013;it's ecstasy that matters. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unlike the grass and sky from the previous scene, language now has the
power to signify. "A toy boat" and "ecstasy" are reduced to the same
meaning, a common denominator of feeling. This reduction elevates the
potential for language to capture and convey meaning. The symmetry of
these two episodes shows how Orlando moves beyond a disappointment in
the limitations of language for expression to a new faith in its power
to mean.
</p>

<p>
As Orlando resolves her struggle with language, so does the
biographer. As the story progresses, the biographer increasingly drops
his pretension toward accuracy and boldly speculates, without excuses,
elements of the story. At one point, when Orlando first meets her
lover Shel, the biographer draws the reader into this
speculation. Shel is a ship captain who exhibits as many feminine
qualities as Orlando does masculine. The biographer describes a scene
of their early courtship:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'Shel, my darling,' she began again, 'tell me&#x2026;' and so they talked
two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and really it
would profit little to write down what they said, for they knew each
other so well that they could say anything, which is tantamount to
saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things as how to cook an
omelette, or where to buy the best boots in London, things which have
no lustre taken from their setting, yet are positively of amazing
beauty within it. For it has come about, by the wise economy of
nature, that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language; the
commonest expressions do, since no expressions do; hence the most
ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and the most poetic is
precisely that which cannot be written down. For which reasons we
leave a great blank here, which must be taken to indicate that the
space is filled to repletion.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The biographer here explains that, though it was actually beautiful
and poetic when it took place, this conversation would come across as
extremely ordinary and boring to the reader. An ordinary conversation
can be poetic at the moment of expression, delivered or said in a way
that is beautiful, which may then lose in language. The reader then
encounters a space break which the biographer instructs her to imagine
is "filled to repletion." This space break recalls the episode with
the manuscript, where the biographer points out that there are holes
or gaps in the record. However, while previously there was a problem
with evidence, now it is a problem with language. According to the
biographer, the means to express this conversation doesn’t exist in
language. As a result, the biographer invites the reader to fill in
the space. To use speculation and guesses as to what happened. The
reader must do what the biographer did when he confronted the lack of
evidence, which was to guess what happens from the available evidence.
</p>

<p>
In troubling the line between objective reality and subjective
experience, Woolf’s parodic biography explores how language and gender
are similarly (and coordinately) constructed. This development in
language both within the story and on the level of narration is
coordinated with Orlando's gender development. Comparing the
biographer and Orlando's experiences with language surface an
interesting insight: language and gender are connected because they
both contain significatory power. While earlier in the novel, Orlando
cannot express the meaning of "blue" and "green," she resolves the
significatory power in the phrase "toy boat." At the same time, at the
level of narrative perspective, the biographer also resolves his issue
with a lack of evidence in the space break that breaks open language's
ability to mean. Language and gender are connected by using the
imagination in creating significatory power, constructing meaning. The
difficulty with language that Orlando and the biographer both
experience becomes less and less of an issue as Orlando comes into her
femininity, which is to say, becomes comfortable in herself. These
changes are possible because the narrative embraces the influence of
the imaginary in language, in minding meaning in words and in
storytelling. This allows Orlando to accept the role of the
imagination in gender, in making gender meaningful.
</p>

<p>
Later in this chapter, I will use text analysis to further explore the
relationship between these themes: language, gender, and the
imagination. So the question then becomes: how are language and gender
co-constructed in Orlando?  What is the role of the imagination in
gender/language? What is the relation between gender, language, and
the imagination?

<p>
This notion of iteration&#x2013;which cuts across both text analysis methods
with NLTK and Butler's theory of gender performativity&#x2013;is the key for
understanding how a repetitive action can lead to new output. In my
previous discussion of reproducibility, I explain how Underwood's
analysis on gender differences reproduces his assumptions about gender
dynamics as oppositional, as he readily admits: "this chapter has
discovered stable 'structural positions' only because it explores
gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition" (<i>Distant Horizons</i>
140). The the binary structure, which is inherent to linear regression
models, reproduces itself the initial assumptions in the
result. Because reproducibility aims for what Underwood describes as a
"simple picture," it collapses or flattens the complexity of data, in
this case, gender, into workable units ("Machine Learning" 98). By
shifting the understanding of reproducibility to iteration, we open up
the possibility for using these tools to interpret elements of gender
and sexuality in text.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-2">
<p>
Iteration departs from reproducibility because iteration
self-consciously harnesses the productive qualities of
reproducibility. We begin to see this in the way that Bode describes
her critical approach, "agential realism," which mirrors Butler's
explanation of gender performativity. Bode describes two approaches
for literary criticism, the "representationalist" approach (in which
data represents or expresses real objects and subjects in the world)
and the another approach understands data "as part of the ongoing
materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events always arising
from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured" (Bode
"Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to Performative
Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a representationalist
approach toward language and materiality, in which language can
<i>refer</i> to materiality as something that is prior, against the
performative approach, by which language works through repetition to
signify and resignify meaning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The alignment here between Bode and Butler indicates an intersection
between the digital and gender as processes, which center on the role
of iteration in conveying meaning. There is something fundamentally
productive about these phenomena, and not in the way that they purport
to represent some real quality or object in the world. Rather, the
productive aspect has to do with how they iterate their material over
and again in ways that are fundamentally creative.

<p>
In what follows, I will use the python text analysis library NLTK to
analyze gender in Woolf's novel, <i>Orlando</i>. Specifically, I will
explore the words associated with "woman" and "man" across this text,
toward the goal of making a kind of "model" for gender performativity
in <i>Orlando</i>. Thinking back to my close reading of <i>Orlando</i>, I found
that the way that gender works is closely tied to the way that
language works&#x2013;Orlando and the biographer conflate the difficulty of
expressing gender to that of telling a story, or writing a poem,
thoughout the text. There is something about gender and language which
is highly constrained, as both Orlando and the narrator are oppressed
by them, but also highly imaginative, eventually allowing both
subjects the potential for signification. Therefore, I will begin my
text analysis by exploring how the terms "woman" and "man" are
characterize in the novel. The computational process that I use will
draw from Butler's theory of performativity by "resignifying" the
terms "woman" and "man" in repeated computations. The final output
will present a series of terms associated with man and woman after
various reiterative computations of the terms throughout the text.
</p>

<p>
We begin by running the <code>similar_words()</code> method from the
nltk.text.ContextIndex class, which functions very nearly like the
<code>Text.similar()</code> method described previously. This <code>similar_words()</code>
method takes a word, such as "woman," and returns the top words that
appear most similarly to that word in the text. Below is the
definition of the ContextIndex class from the NLTK source code:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
class ContextIndex(object):
    """
    A bidirectional index between words and their 'contexts' in a text.
    The context of a word is usually defined to be the words that occur
    in a fixed window around the word; but other definitions may also
    be used by providing a custom context function.
    """
</p>

</div>

<p>
The NLTK documentation explains that similarity is computed by
processing the words that directly surround the given word, or its
"context," and finding other words that have similar contexts. In the
source code for the <code>similar_words()</code> method, there is an <code>if loop</code>
that instructs the program to search if the words in the context also
are associated with other words throughout the text. It then returns a
list of the 20 most frequent terms which have similar contexts to the
given word.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Below is the output for the words, "woman" and "man," respectively:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&gt; similar<sub>words</sub>("woman")
'reached till friend word moment saw always could cried sailor wit

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-4">
<p>
Each time a text is processed in computation, it is submitted to a
governing code. In this case of the <code>similar_words()</code> method, the code
reduces the text to whatever conditions are contained within the
function loop. The output therefore is directly constrained to the
conditions in the input. Each time one feeds the output of our
computation to a new one, running <code>similar_words()</code> method again, they
gain an even more refined list of words that are associated with
"woman" and "man."  Below are the results of running <code>similar_words()</code>
taking the output of the previous run of <code>similar_words("woman")</code> as
the new input:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
'come friend scarcely make happiness could say wisdom used thing grown

</p>

<p>
And the output for <code>similar_words("man")</code>, running it a second time:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
'title come need fault carriage tongue fortune death hungry passion
gloomy grown love written still must always saw exactly alone almost
perhaps take word matter determined orlando beautiful hear hurry woman
boy plump sens man soon little morning full strength whose two father
monstrously without ever would roused kinsman admit become old window
sink moment'
</p>

</div>

<p>
One may continue to run this <code>similar_words()</code> analysis, feeding the
output as new input, to get an ever expanding sense of words which are
associated with gender. This would be interesting, as the repertoire
for "woman" and "man" would swell to significations that elude the
gender as a binary. Eventually, however, the repertoire would include
more and more shared terms between the two genders. To avoid what
would inevitably be a merging of words associated with each gender, we
can slightly change the input before running the computation again. We
will filter out any words that were shared between the categories of
"woman" and "man". This will allow us to get a better sense of gender
<i>distinction</i> in the text.
</p>

<p>
Filtering out shared words, and placed unique, similar words for "man"
and for "woman" into a new list, we can run <code>similar_words()</code>
again. For <code>similar_words()</code> on the words associated with "woman," we
get the following <i>unique</i> words:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
'among slipping launched child beneath shape new gently prophet indeed

</p>

</div>

<p>
For "man," we get:
</p>

<div class="SOURCE">
<p>
'certain need fault wicket agitate hungry long passion talk circle
ague whatever written turn said explain treachery husband beast
remembered sleep longer pared filled tell princess deep beard tied
beautiful hear put mixture profound fumbled inborn rout immovable
plump awkwardness sens sofa whole mind morning imagine toss many made
iron blush round set whose raised first part monstrously without
needing taste story boyish admitted longed insisted looking glance
pushing'
</p>

</div>

<p>
By filtering out shared words between "woman" and "man," we come
closer to modelling gender distinctiveness in this text. To be clear,
gender in this sense descends from a binary system&#x2013;from the initial
analysis of "woman" and "man." However, from this initial
binarization, it leads to a plurality of significations.  
</p>

<p>
This kind of iterative analysis, where the data is being adjusted to
increase the distinctiveness and complexity of the output, works
toward <i>resignifying</i> the initial understanding of "woman" and "man."
It takes what Butler says about gender being an iterative performance,
which is continually "citing" the regulatory norm, and submits this
performance to the highly iterative process of running text through
computational analysis. 
</p>

<p>
Like gender subversion, this kind of computational analysis works
through strict protocols of repetition and iteration toward some kind
of disruptive end goal. As Alexander Galloway affirms, “Protocol is
synonymous with possibility” (167). Galloway here is discussing
network theory, and by "protocol," he refers specifically to the codes
that append data which mades connections possible in a network. Like
gender performativity, networks are constrained by protocols, which
enable and structure connections between nodes. Despite the
restrictions of protocol, however, there is a freedom in the
possibility of connection, where each node is free to connect to
another within the system.<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup> Similarly to hackers in a network,
Butler's idea of gender subversion is is looking for the "exploit,"
the way to disrupt the system by using the system’s own rules. The key
to Butler's exploit is the iterative nature of gender performativity,
which can be used to repeat and resignify meaning.

Butler explains that the repetition of language is what enables

<p>
This [forthcoming!] model of gender distinctiveness in <i>Orlando</i> draws
from the same principles as Pamela Caughie et al. in their work in
visualizing gender ontology in <i>Man Into Woman</i> (1931), the life
narrative of Lili Elbe, one of the first persons to undergo gender
affirmation surgery. As Caughie and her team struggle to mark gender
shifts throughout the text in a way that accords with the constraints
of the archival methodology, they wonder whether computational models
can capture such taxonomic chaos of gender ontology. However, they
ultimately find that the issue with categorizing gender doesn't need a
solution. Rather, it needs a way of showing gender dynamicity while
still being readable. The scholars point out that the issue with
ontology <i>should</i> remain unresolved: "Confusion in gender and sexual
terminologies&#x2026; is part of the experienceof gender and sexuality in
the modernist era, something to be realized and negotiated in readings
of the narrative" (239). Thus they ended up creating a "storm cloud"
of gender, showing clusters of different gender traits in the text
over time.

In my previous close reading of <i>Orlando</i>, I found that gender is
linked to the role of language in the way that they both are highly
constructed phenomena that activate significatory power. After
exploring the ways that gender and language are coordinately
constructed in the novel, I was left with a question about the role of
the imagination in influencing gender and language. This text analysis
of Orlando attempts to bear out the implications of this question, to
explore how the imaginative use of language, represented in the ever
expanding networks of gender signification, troubles the idea of
gender as a binary system. The process of running the gender terms
"woman" and "man" reveals how even a constrained process of repeated
computations can help to complicate or diversify the data, rather than
simplify or reduce it. This notion of displacement through repetition
is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the iterative
process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures that
re-signify certain elements of that text.

Although I aim to offer a model of gender in the novel, as Butler
affirms, "radical and inclusive representability is not precisely the
goal" (<i>Bodies</i> 25). Remaining <i>outside</i> what Butler calls the "logic
of phallogocentrism" is necessary to prevent being coopted into that
logic. The process of performative citation is meant to preserve that
which is excluded or unintelligible as a resource for continual
resignification, as "the point of departure for a set of historical
reflections and futural imaginings" (Butler <i>Bodies</i> 173). For, Butler
explains that, "to bring in every marginal and excluded position
within a given discourse is to claim that a singular discourse meets
its limits nowhere, that it can and will domesticate all signs of
difference" (25). Rather than aim for inclusion, one ought to position
the "necessary outside" as a target that is beyond reach, as a fount
for future subversions. This positioning allows individuals to harness
opacity and unintelligibility as a resource for resisting the
"violence of this exclusion," using unrepresentability as a tool for
disruption.

<p>
Displacement through repetition; insubordination through subservience;
deception through resemblance&#x2013;these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism. I began
this analysis into <i>Orlando</i> by close reading sections of the text, to
explore how gender functions as an enabling structure. This reading
found that gender is closely coordinated with language, as Orlando and
the biographer, across different narrative levels of the story,
struggle with both simultaneously. I read for gender as an enabling
structure, and then used text analysis to play with gender by
repeating the same processes of computing "gendered" term similarities
over and over again. I saw how gender in this novel resembles an
expanding web of terms that multiply while remaining distinct, which
complicates the notion of gender as a binary system even within that
system. This method of iterating over text allowed me to illuminate
the structure of the signifying power without giving that power the
ability to counter that which is questioning its authority. Although
one may attempt to formalize such a method, my goal is not to build
reproducible schemas and models for analyzing gender in
novels. Rather, I look to harness opacity and unintelligibility as
resources for resisting inclusion. This method posits gender as a kind
of technology of resistance, which the technology of digital tools can
help to surface. I hope this work will encourage the further
development of such approaches, which, as Butler nicely articulates,
"begin, without ending, without mastering, to own – and yet never
fully to own – the exclusions by which we proceed" (25).

There's a dip in the word "don't" toward the end of the novel, in

</p>

<p>
Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter
five, a spike that is surrounded with a dearth of don'ts. This
explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

This activity calls for closer attention to the area of the spike, and

<p>
&#x2013;&gt; reproducing something perfectly overlooks the ways that all
digital objects are unique, differentiated. Theory of textual
criticism which shows how ther are more interesting things to do then
create a digital "copy texte". 
</p>

<p>
This notion extends to digital humanist practitioners. 
</p>

<p>
they call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses" while maintaining that reproduction is
the highest value. They argue to "texture the humanities", pointing
out that much of DH prioritizes the visual over other senses &#x2013;
"privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible"
(74). Rightly so, they argue, “The textured DH we call for here
acknowledges that we cannot study knowledge only abstractly, apart
from the senses, and that we cannot study literature, art, and history
without including the history of embodied experiences” (74-75).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“Touch This Page! uses 3-D printed facsimiles of raised-letter text
to inspire reflection on the assumptions most people make about
which senses are involved in reading” (82).</li>
</ul>

<p>
But they elide the one interesting trajectory when they place
reproduction over remediation/deformance. They state their aims: “to
expand the sensory accessibility of archives for all users and to do
so through the digital reproduction&#x2014;rather than the translation&#x2014;of
tactile knowledge” (76). Case example of the perfect reproduction:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A scenario where “users&#x2026; can download a visual copy with</li>
</ul>
<p>
descriptive data, engage with the text in virtual reality, and create
their own textured facsimile. This technology once more makes possible
the tactile reading experiences for which this volume was designed and
promises library patrons a richer engagement with touch than most
archives can currently provide&#x2014;even in person (85-86). 
</p>

<p>
The use case scenario makes the assumption that a reproduction is the
ideal form of textuality, despite their asserted aims for "diversity
of embodied experiences":
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“we must avoid tilting after the fiction of some ideal digital
surrogate&#x2014;like a virtual reality system that would flawlessly
mimic original objects&#x2014;lest we become digital Pierre Menards,
expending extensive energy to improve our reproductions to discover,
at last, that only the original perfects represents itself… Instead,
we envision in our tactile futures multiple strategies that could
not only open up access to varied experiences&#x2014;past and
present&#x2014;but also diversity the ways embodied experiences structure
our digital worlds” (86).</li>
<li>in order to open up “multiple strategies” and diversity embodied
experiences, we need a theory of text that is capacious enough to
accept variation and transmediation.</li>
<li>This argument overlooks deformance is a solution: the ways that
creating new texts, paratexts, creates new objects of knowledge. It
overlooks the performative, ala McGann, Clement.</li>

In this view, digital becomes a means of optimization, efficiency,
total knowledge and understanding.

<p>
"the reader-text connection becomes part of a network rather than a
self-enclosed dyad— yet a connection that remains vital to literary
studies, especially in the classroom. Reading, in this light, is a
matter of attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging
links between things that were previously unconnected. It is not a
question of plumbing depths or tracing surfaces… Interpretation
becomes a coproduction between actors that brings new things to light
rather than an endless rumination on a text’s hidden meanings or
representational failures” (Felski 174)
</p>

<p>
Surface reading challenges that search for absence by compelling a
reader to stay with what the text says and how it says it rather than
moving ahead to probe how it reflects and refracts larger cultural
patterns. This critique reifies aesthetic objects and suggests that
literary critics should embrace the literary.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-7">
<p>
Major developments in technology also perpetuate racial
assumptions. Moving from networking technologies to software
development, Tara McPherson explores the parallels between the
Operating Systems and race relations, to show how the development of
computer software betrays hegemonic assumptions about whiteness and
elisions of difference.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup> She focuses on the key moment of 1960s
United States, when Operating Systems, which is the foundational
software that supports a computer's programs and basic functioning,
developed alongside civil rights discourses. Her research focuses on
how "the organization of information and capital" in OS development
resonates in the struggles for racial justice: "Many of these shifts
were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
radicalism" (30). McPherson deconstructs the UNIX operating system
which includes a hierarchical file system, a command line interpreter
(the Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), and a variety of
software programs that are designed to work in tandem. McPherson
points out that UNIX-based Operating Systems (like Mac and Linux) are
distinguished by the ways that they partition and simplify complex
processes into discrete components, similar to the ways that identity
politics cordones off parts of the (social and technological) system
into distinct units. While this cordoning was productive for the
promotion of civil rights, it also, according to McPherson, "curtailed
and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing
struggle to fairly discrete parameters" (30).
</p>

<p>
Crystallizing the intersection between Operating Systems and race
relations, McPherson asserts that "Certain modes of racial visibility
and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing
data" (24). McPherson emphasizes the "rules" of UNIX philosophy, which
lay out how UNIX's development prioritized the organization and
simplification of data processing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear
by demonstration that nothing else will do. Rule of Transparency:
Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier&#x2026; Rule
of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be
stupid and robust. 26
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions. The rule of "Transparency" flattens
nuance and ambiguity, making program components as legible as
possible. The rule of "Representation," particularly the suggestion to
"Fold knowledge into data" reduces the complexity of raw data, so that
it can be easily input into multiple processes. According to
McPherson, all of these rules work together to shore up the central
design theory of "modularity,"<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup> which stipulates that components
are self-contained and interoperable, so they can be independently
created, modified, and replaced without affecting the whole system.
</p>

<p>
The role of control in creating the internet and the emphasis on data
reduction in developing operating stystems leave their legacies on
21st century digital technology, where race becomes collapsed into
data. Echoing McPherson, Ruha Benjamin asserts that technology
reproduces social inequities under the guise of objectivity and
progressivism.<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup> Turning to technology, Benjamin explores how
innovations in Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic computing
extend racist paradigms into ever new tools, particularly in data
gathering and surveillance. The creators of these new technologies
mark, track, and quantify blackness, for example, in databases for
healthcare or financial services that associate "black names" with
criminality (Benjamin 5). With each update, technology is continually
promoted as efficient and progressive in a way that masks how it
exploits data about its subjects. Benjamin explains, "we are told that
how tech sees “difference” is a more objective reflection of reality
than if a mere human produced the same results&#x2026; bias enters through
the backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6). As she points out, "the road
to inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7). Like the creators of
UNIX, the creators of such tools and algorithms operate under
assumptions of white universality that inevitably marks blackness as
"other."

The way that media works in the 21st century both marginalizes and

sensations are indirect. This puts consciousness in an anticipatory

flexible enough, we do not have to agree on a schema, standardize a
schema, in order to use the tool to engage the incommensurable.

and are tested against “data” that appears to contradict it (<i>Signs</i>

possible to interpret this element in the following way,’ to replace
it with the much more prosaic, ‘the following interpretation is
impossible for such and such a reason,’ it will have taken a huge step
forward on the road of methodological solidity” (<i>Signs</i> 22).)
