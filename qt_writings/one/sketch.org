* Chapter One Sketch

Revising the first draft. 

** the fantasy of the falsifiable 
Paranoid reading methods encourage a reproducible kind of criticism
that doesn't teach us anything novel about gender. How do we get out
of the cycle of reproducibility?

*** intro - computing queerness
The question: how do we deform a text to bring out new forms of
gender?

*** reading methods
Paranoid reading is about expressing something something hidden. This
reading style encourages reproducibility in criticism, turning 
reading into a mechanical practice that searches for what is hidden
rather than what is on the surface ofthe text.

*** DR begins in the falsifiable, toward reproducibility
Distant reading furthers this reproductive impulse in paranoid
reading. The paranoia to analyze vast swaths of literary history. 

Franco Moretti's scholarship has been invested in riding the critic of
subjectivity, in creating a reproducible (to the point of automating)
analysis. 

Reproducibility is so paranoid that even those who disagree with
quantification think of it as a benchmark (Da).

*** Ramsay and Drucker's speculative methods
There are critics doing speculative work--using computers as an
opportunity for critical analysis (Ramsay) and using them to engage
with data that is reduced or flattened (Drucker).

*** orientation makes the difference: falsifiable v speculative
The difference between the falsifiable and the speculative--the
falsifiable creates a reproducible critique.

*** reading for social categories SoRoland
Reproducibility blocks out other relation to text, especially aspects
that are slippery or marginalized, such as gender. There are attempts
to use DR for this kind of social analysis. SoRoland uses machine
learning to explore the constructedness of social
categories--whiteness as a category depends on blackness. They also
find material speculation in the form of an error, something
unexpected that yields a new reading. They conclude that machine is an
apt tool for studying race because it similarly uses highly
constructed and reductive methodologies.

*** Underwood: reproducing gender
Underwood uses statistical modeling to study how words associated with
gender change over time. The way that Underwood studies gender is by
associating adjectives with male/female and then making
predictions. Input leads to output. Underwood's method and approach
reify the structure of gender as a binary. He approaches gender as
something to be settled, reproduced and verified. 

*** Mandell: deconstructing/multiplying gender
Mandell criticizes the reduction of gender into the M/F binary, and
instead explores new taxonomies of gender by seeing how "genre" cuts
across gender and is part of its constitution. She is deconstructing
gender by analyzing genre. She argues that computers are ideal
for "breaking down the strength of the signal", and "computation
enables complexity". There is a potential for animation of data.

However, gender is actually more constrained than Mandell allows. It
constitutes subjectivity, not "highly imitable." We ought to look to
the ways that gender constitutes subjectivity.

*** computation & gender mutually enlightening
The computer enables complexity, but only under certain
constraints. As it turns out, computation, like gender, is also
constrained. Gender and computation can be mutually enlightening,
seeing constraint in form. Like SoRoland says, computation is good for
deconstructing, but we can also do this within a speculative mode,
like Ramsay/Drucker, starting with the error, and moving out. 


** deformance and preformance
This section poses text analysis, where textual data is cleaned,
structured, and normalized for computation, against the process of
performativity. Here, I am looking at how these two phenomena--gender
performance and text analysis--might coincide. I also review some DH
practices that engage elements of performativity, to highlight some
critical approaches that use this concept.

if gender is a series of acts, of repetitions, so is the process of
text analysis. 

*** NLTK
Look at the constrained nature of regularization -- briefly!

*** constraints of computational lit crit
McGann, Bode, Clement: how critics in English studies have approached
the constraints of computation into their work --- by harnessing
attention, abstraction, speculation.

*** queer performance
Now, look at gender as a constraint. In performative acts, the
repudiated terms (like 'queer') is what has the power to disrupt
existing significatory schemas. 

*** example of performative citation: Irigaray
Repetition displaces the logic of the signifying structure. 

*** preserving the unintelligible
the key to disrupting without doing violence (making
representationalist claims) is to never try to keep the unintelligible
outside, preserve it for continual resignification. 


** queer distant reading
An iterative method of distant reading attends to gender as an
iterative practice. We find ever expanding ways that gender is
characterized in /Orlando/. 

*** bode and butler parallel on language productivity
There is something fundamentally productive about language

*** reproducibility reduces data
Reproducibility reduces data into abstractable, "simple picture"
forms which perpetuate themselves.

*** shifting to the speculative
But we might use deformance and performance to harness reduction
toward speculative ends.

*** orlando close reading - gender as enabling constraint
For example, in Orlando, how does gender constrain other elements of
the text? Not in a way that hides/makes elements latent, but explores
what is on the surface? Close reading of gender in the novel finds
that it is related to language and the significatory power of
language. As Orlando settles into her gender, she is also able to find
the ability to mean, and the narrator can use experimental strategies
for telling the story.

*** TODO Man and Woman in Orlando
Qe are resignifying man and woman to mean differently in Orland by
creating a model of their significations.

*** TODO modeling gender distinctiveness
make a model of the way that the genders distinguish themselves in the
novel---imaginative elaborations of gender. 

*** TODO iterating over the code resignifies it
running the computation over and over again with new inputs is a way
of resignifying. Like a game of telephone.

*** TODO findings: new configurations of gender
what do we find out about gender here? how does this change the way we
approach this text?

*** TODO the power of the imagination
this process reveals the hidden "enabling structure" of the imagination

*** TODO conclusion: performative citation queers distant reading
insubordination through subservience, displacement through repetition


** networkx visualization

Using networkx to make a network graph of terms related to "woman" and
"man" in Orlando. 

The nodes are the terms, and the edges connect terms that have been
computed as ~similar_words()~. 

For the first level, create a list of words that are similar to
woman. Then, create a nested list of words that are similar to the
first level of similar words. Finally, add the nodes and edges for the
first level of similar words.

For the second level, create a dict which will take key:list of values
relationships as node & edge pairs.
- First, create a list of second level similar words, filtering out the
  term 'woman' (and any duplicates?  maybe later). 
- Second, create a dict that with the key 'woman' and a list of values
  that are first level similar words. Then, create more keys of each
  of the first level similar words. To those keys, add lists of words
  computed to be similar to them.

This worked. Now I'm going to

**** Benzel, Kathryn N. 
"Reading readers in Virginia Woolf's Orlando: A Biography." Style,
Summer 1994, p. 169+.

Emphasizes the role of the reader in creating meaning in the
text. Woolf writes in a way that creates multiple levels of meaning,
inviting the reader's interpretation. 

The space break exemplifies this--creating literal space--an absence
of evidence--for the reader to speculate. An absence which the reader
has to fill in.

The novel is a "trans text" (218) that interrogates the structures and
boundaries of nationality by challenging the concept of embodied
identity. "The transnational situation as also intrinsically
transgender" (218). Shows us the ways that bodies are marked and
categorized (221).

Constructed Selves in Virginia Woolf's Orlando.” Twentieth Century
Literature, vol. 40, no. 3, 1994, pp. 342–364. JSTOR,

The novel challenges "essentialized" concepts of femininity. Notions
of stable identity and biography are parodied. 

**** Caughie, Pamela. "Virginia Woolf's Double Discourse," 1989. 
 
Orlando is feminist for the way it precludes or obsures or refuses any
straightforward understanding of identity, sex, language. (41) 

"This sexual and textual indeterminacy links language and identity. As
the androgynous Orlando brings the question of sexual identity to the
fore, the obtrustive narrator brings the textual language to the fore
by intruding to discuss how own art" (42). 

"Double discourse" - "what appears to be an opposition between
positions is tolerated as difference without belligerance, as
different options on a spectrum of possibilities, not a /choice/ of
position but a /doubling/ of vision" (50). 

"for sex cannot be separated from text, the grammatical from the
gendered" (51). 
**** Cervetti, "In the Breeches, Petticoats, and Pleasures of Orlando"
(1996). 

Take orlando out of the details of Woolf's life, not a biography or a
love letter, but a feminist statement on gender, identity, and the
body (165). 

The criniline and its effect on her personality/behavior (the body):
"clothing alters the physical body" (169). 

**** Channing, Jill.
"Magical realism and gender variability in Orlando." Virginia Woolf

Orlando's narrative disruptions of realism and challenges against

key "irreducible element" where "there is no explanation" (11-12).

Examines racial and gendered strictures of nationalism from a
privileged position of british white femininity.

Orlando is "an ambivalent articulation of English nationalism," how
that nationalism intersects with (and depents on) gender and race
(394). "Orlando critiques whiteness and heterosexuality ambivalently
and unevenly," using radialized and sexually transgresive subjects in
a way that "allows the protagonist to pass as respectible and
heterosexual" (398). Although Orlando challenges compulsory
heterosexuality of national identity, she does so by appropriating
otherness; uses femininity to hint at this playfully, taking advantage
of white femininity.

Orlando is an extention of Woolf's love for Vita; representing Vita's

It is a coded love letter, but "the central relationship is between
Orlando and the biographer" (29).

Reading Orlando as a love letter diminishes the other feminist and
queer readings, of queer time, the way that the novel disrupts
reproductive futurism. Critiques understanding of time as naturalized,
of the social scripts that govern timelines: "For Woolf, rupturing the
generic conventions of biography is a means of unseating(?) the
keystone of normativity, itself" ().

**** Sadjadi and Hojabli, "Gender, Performance, and Agency in Woolf's

Orlando explores the limits of representation in narrative, reality,
identity, gender. "The fantastic content in the novel is directly
linked to the undecidability/impossibility of the form of the novel
and of the protagonist" (58). 

The novel "thematizes within the text how representation or, rather
more particularly, how literary language finds itself at a loss"
(68). "The text offers a recuperation of the object while bemoaning
the inadequacy of language" (68). Thus, the Sasha episode, the
description of nature, the indescribable love for Shel. 

The "doubleness of language... laments inadequacies while effectively
and fantastically achieving her ends" (69). 

**** Rado, Lisa. "Would the Real Virginia Woolf Please Stand
Up?" 1997. 

"Woolf appropriated the figure of the androgyne to generate the create
inspiration and artistic authority she felt she lacked" (150). One
result is a repression of her body, the female body. Orlando is
overlooked, not seen as serious, by scholarship (150-151).

"Attempting to employ an androgynous movel of the imagination involves
the painful and continuous repression of the body that ultimate
indicator of sexual difference" (157-8). The trances, sasha, shel
demonstrate this.

**** Rongstad, "The Representation of Gender in Woolf's
/Orlando/," 2012.

Gender performance in clothing and costumes, shows gender is
constructed (54). Personality is satble while gender shifts with
clothing. 


















*** Critiques of Butler

**** Geoff Boucher, "The Politics of Performativity":

Butler locates the "potential for subversion" "in a disembodied
intentionality that appears to stand outside of the
culturally-scripted subject positions that the individual occupies"
(115). 

"Gender performances... are subjectless procedures of a discursive
formation" (116). 

"Who (or what) decides 'how to repeat'? On what basis is the ecision
to subvert power made?" (119). 

"free-floating intentionality" (119).

In other writing on Althusser, however, Butler relies on a
pre-discursive desire for recognition, a "primary narcissism" (121)
which explains "where the intentionality that drives gender parody is
located" (121). 

**** Prosser, Jay. /Second Skins: The Body Narratives of
Trannsexuality/, Columbia U Press, 1998. 

Prosser's main argument is that queer theory, and gender
performativity in particular, has relied on transgender
identification in ways that elide the specificity of the trans body. 

"The question of how to represent the narratives of
transsexuality... to put into narrative its remarkable bodily
trajectories" (4). 

Goal is to read the materiality of transsexual body into narratives:
"To bring into view the mateirality of the body" (12).  

Critique of Butler and queer theory generally: Butler considers
"transitions as discursive but not explored in the bodiliness of
gendered crossings" (6). 

Butler's work considers gender, not sex, crossings, sex is "what was
beneath the favored terrain of performativity" (6). Transsexuality is
about embodiment. 
- "deliteralization of sex" - displaced from materiality to fantacized
  surface.
- on "Gender is Burning" in BTM: "According to Butler, transgressive
crossings can simultaneously reinscribe symbolic norms" (45). There is
a "metaphorization of the transsexual body" (55). If Venus got her sex
change, she would cease to be subversive" (49). This is a "critical
perversity" (49). 

Queer studies has depended on the transgender, has relied on
transgender desires (21).

Critique of Sedgwick: Theorizing about homosexuality relies on
cross-gendered identifications. In /Between Men/, normative sexuality
depends on male identification, and the avowal of such, with women as
objects of desire (22). 



Criticism:

"transsexuality's somatic transitions are spurred and enabled by the
formal transitions of narrative... Sex change is a plot... [Prosser's
book suggests transsexuality, with its extraordinary conjunctions of
body and narrative, as an identity story that transitions across the
body/language divide that currently stalls poststucturalist thought."

From Judith Halberstam's review: 

  Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality. Jay Prosser
  Trans Liberation: Beyond Pink or Blue. Leslie Feinberg FTM:
  Female-to-Male Transsexuals in Society. Holly Devor Judith Halberstam
  /Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society/ 2000 26:1, 313-317

  "Jay Prosser delineates three major areas for discussion: first,
  the (mis)representation of the transgender body within queer theory
  as a privileged example of gender performativity" (313).

   "In a discussion of poststructuralist treatments of the transsexual
   body, Prosser vigorously contests the notion that the body is
   simply an inscribed surface or a discursive effect; such a reading
   of the body becomes particularly problematic for the transsexual
   whose desire for a sex change suggests a return to the literal, the
   real, the intractable flesh" (314).

   "In a dense and complex chapter on the work of Judith Butler,
   Prosser argues that her texts, central as they are to queer theory,
   simultaneously invoke and repudiate the transsexual body as a
   figure for gender crossing.  In Gender Trouble, Prosser argues, the
   transgender figures of the drag queen and the butch lesbian "come
   to appear the empirical subjects of gender performativity, their
   crossing illustrating both the inessentiality of sex and the
   nonoriginality of heterosexuality that was the book's thesis"
   (26). And yet, when Butler shifts her gaze from the transgender
   figure to the transsexual in /Bodies That Matter/, the transsexual
   represents a limit to performativity. Prosser claims that, while
   transgender and queer may be allied in Butler's work, transsexual
   and queer are most certainly in opposition.  Prosser's reading of
   Butler is crucial to the political stakes of his book.  In true
   deconstructive fashion, he aims his critical attention at Butler's
   mis- reading of a footnote in Freud about the relationship between
   body and ego. When she misreads /ego/ as /body/, Prosser claims,
   Butler dematerializes the body as a fantasy/fiction of the ego
   while Freud wanted to make the body the materialization of the
   psyche. This misreading sets up a series of priorities for queer
   performativity that are all at odds with transsexuality.
   Accordingly, Prosser understands queer theory to validate surface
   over depth, gender over sex, fiction over the real, the visual over
   the felt, the queer over the heterosexual. "In its representation
   of sex as a figurative effect of straight gender's constative
   performance," he claims, "/Gender Trouble/ cannot account for the
   transsexual desire for sexed embodiment S I G N S Autumn 2000 1 315
   /telos/" (33). I think Prosser's reading of Butler is compelling,
   and it is partic- ularly persuasive when Prosser tackles the most
   problematic chapter in /Bodies That Matter/, a close reading of the
   limits of performativity in relation to the transsexual drag queens
   in Jennie Livingston's film /Paris is Burning/." (314-315)

*** biographer's struggle with crisis of signification
Interestingly, moments in the novel that convey this crisis in
signification occur across two levels of the story, that is, within
the central action of Orlando's life, and also within the narration
itself, by the biographer who endeavors to relate Orlando's life to
the reader. 



*** toy boat and space break

After Orlando's sex change, her issues with language begin to resolve,
and language suddenly takes on significatory power. In one scene,
Orlando watches a toy boat on a river in Hyde Park. When the boat
disappears then re-emerges on the other side of the wavelet, Orlando
suddenly realizes that language can take on extraordinary
significatory power, in which a "toy boat" can mean "ecstasy":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,' she repeated, thus enforcing upon
herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor
eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter; it's
something useless, sudden, violent; something that costs a life; red,
blue, purple; a spirit; a splash; like those hyacinths (she was passing a
fine bed of them); free from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or
care for one's kind; something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth,
husband I mean, Bonthrop: that's what it is--a toy boat on the
Serpentine, ecstasy--it's ecstasy that matters. 
#+END_QUOTE
In direct contrast to the earlier scene, where Orlando "despaired of
being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is
and fell into a deep dejection" (75), language now has the power to
signify. This concentration of meaning, in which "a toy boat" and
"ecstasy" are reduced to a common denominator of an ecstatic feeling,
elevates the potential for language to express. The symmetry of these
two episodes, which occur on opposite sides of the sex change, show
how Orlando moves beyond a disappointment in the limitations of
language for expression to a credibility in its power to mean.

As Orlando resolves her struggle with language, so does the
biographer. As the story progresses, the biographer increasingly drops
his pretension toward accuracy and boldly speculates upon events of
Orlando's life, for example, when Orlando first meets her lover Shel:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Shel, my darling,' she began again, 'tell me...' and so they talked
two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and really it
would profit little to write down what they said, for they knew each
other so well that they could say anything, which is tantamount to
saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things as how to cook an
omelette, or where to buy the best boots in London, things which have
no lustre taken from their setting, yet are positively of amazing
beauty within it. For it has come about, by the wise economy of
nature, that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language; the
commonest expressions do, since no expressions do; hence the most
ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and the most poetic is
precisely that which cannot be written down. For which reasons we
leave a great blank here, which must be taken to indicate that the
space is filled to repletion.
#+END_QUOTE
The use of the space break, which is meant to signify everything that
passes between Orlando and Shel and more ("it is filled to repletion")
functions by signifying nothing. According to critics like Katheryn
N. Benzel, this moment creates literal space for the reader to fill in
with her own interpretation of the scene. And Caughie points out, such
a device works "not because of what it says about sexual identity but
because of what it manages not to say," which reinfoces what she calls
the "double discourse" of the novel (Caughie 41). The text creates
oppositions, even paradoxes, which purposefully cannot be resolved,
such as "the most ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and
the most poetic is precisely that which cannot be written down." As a
formal device, the space break works to reinforce the capacity to
signify through language, even while, to repeat Smith's words,
"bemoaning the inadequacy of language" (Smith 68).



*** Queer distant reading
For this reason, I argue (and demonstrate below) how the study of
gender in the text can be accomplished through a quantitative analysis
of language. This quantitative analysis of language attends to gender
as an /iterative/ practice, rather than a /reproducible/ one which as
Underwood and Da demonstrate, reifies already existing conceptual
structures that bind social categories like gender. Underwood readily
admits that his work has "discovered stable 'structural positions'
only because it explores gender, for the most part, as a binary
opposition" (/Distant Horizons/ 140). This work, by contrast, turns to
the iteration--which cuts across both text analysis methods with NLTK
and Butler's theory of gender performativity--as the key for
understanding how a repetitive practice (like that of performative
citation) will reveal the expanding ways that gender is characterized
in /Orlando/. By shifting the understanding of reproducibility to
iteration, I apply the particular constraint of this tool, which is
repetition, to interpret elements of gender and sexuality in the text.

The idea of taking performativity into a methodology for digital
scholarship is not new. In particular, Katherine Bode's critical
approach, what she calls "performative materiality," draws from, not
Bulter's ideas about gender, but feminist scientist Karen Barad's
studies of quantum physics. This approach takes Barad's concept of
"agential realism," that objects in the world do not precede their
actions, but emerge through particular "intra-actions," and applies it
to her quantitative analysis of literary databases (Barad 58). Bode
brings Barad's "agential realism" from theoretical physics to explain
the /productive/ qualites of using computational analysis to study
literary databases. She approaches data as "effects of material-semiotic
engagements," where "entities don’t pre-exist engagements but
are generated in an ongoing or emergent way, by those intra-actions"
("Data Beyond Represenation" par. 15, 2). For Bode, attention to
performative materiality encourages scholars to focus on the material
processes of using their tools, rather than attempt to secure a
factual or objective status of data.

Though they are dealing with vastly different objects of study, Bode
and Butler both converge on their critique of reproducibility, or
"representationalist" methods, and the proposal of a
counter-methodology, which is "productive" through iteration. The
productive approach, according to Bode, understands data "as part of
the ongoing materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events
always arising from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured"
(Bode "Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to
Performative Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a
representationalist approach toward language and materiality, in which
language can refer to materiality as something that is prior, against
the performative approach, by which language works through repetition
to resignify meaning:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
#+END_QUOTE
This alignment between Bode and Butler centers on the productive power
of iteration in resignifying meaning. There is something fundamentally
productive about the process of iteration, which has nothing to do
with representing or re-representing some real quality or object in
the world, but with the way that iteration constitutes and
re-constitutes meaning.

In what follows, I use NLTK to analyze gender in /Orlando/. Drawing my
methodology from Butler's concept of performative citation, I compute
the words associated with "woman" and "man" within the text, with the
end goal of visualizing theses various associations in a network
graph, that is, a web of of "re-significations" of the words "woman"
and "man."  See Appendix A for a copy of the program code.

I begin the process by running the ~similar_words()~ method, which
takes a word, such as "woman," and returns the top words that appear
most similarly to that word in the text. The NLTK documentation
explains that similarity is computed by processing the words that
directly surround the given word, or its "context," and finding other
words that have similar contexts.[fn:1] It then returns a list of the
most frequent terms which have similar contexts to the given
word. Below are the words associated with "woman" and "man,"
respectively:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
> similar_words("woman")
'reached till friend word moment saw always could cried sailor wit
scarcely petticoat go servant conclusion'

> similar_words("man") 
'hurry father window tongue carriage still even countrywoman indulged
old fortune title ship writing fell become always love grown never'
#+END_QUOTE
	  
Each time a text is processed in computation, it is submitted to a
governing code. In this case of the ~similar_words()~ method, the code
enforces whatever conditions are contained within the function loop.
In the source code for the ~similar_words()~ method, there is an ~if
loop~ that instructs the program to search if the words in the context
also are associated with other words throughout the text.[fn:14] The
output therefore is directly constrained to the conditions in the
input.

However, there are ways to resist this control. Alexander Galloway,
who writes about the protocols, or control structures, which enable
network connections, explains that "Protocol is synonymous with
possibility" (Galloway 167). Galloway shows how protocols that drive
the internet connectivity, such as DNS and ISP, are instituted through
code, which must conform to a certain standard in order to
successfully communicate. For Galloway, resistance is possible by
manipulating the controlling structure by coopting its protocol. In
this case, I take the constraint of iterativity, which is contained
within the repetitive processes of the ~similar_words()~ method, and
feed new data into its computation. For example, when I feed the
output of the first computation to a new one, running
~similar_words()~ method again, it results in an exapanded list of
words that are associated with "woman" and "man." Below are the
results of running ~similar_words()~ under these conditions, taking
the output of the previous calculation for "woman" as new input:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE

indeed word stood met laughing sailor none able mixture allied woman

#+END_SOURCE

Below are the results for the same process, this time with the output
of for ~similar_words("man")~ as new input:

I may continue to run this ~similar_words()~ analysis, feeding the
output as new input, to gain an ever expanding sense of words which
are associated with each gender. However, to avoid what would
inevitably result in more and more shared terms between the two
genders, I slightly refine the the input before running the
computation again. Here, I filter out any words that are shared
between the categories of "woman" and "man". This filtering will allow
me to get a better sense of gender distinction in the text. After
filtering out shared words, and placing the unique associated words
for "man" and for "woman" into a new list, I run ~similar_words()~
again, with the following result for words associated "woman":

[Visualization of gender distinctiveness in /Orlando/ using the python
networkx module]

The resulting image of gender distinctiveness in /Orlando/ shows how
the central term, "woman," has expanded over two levels of
similarity. Here, one can see that clusters form around certain words,
like "go," "could," "moment," and "wit," for example. Femininity is
associated at once with action, cognitive ability, and
conditionality. From a traditionally feminine point of view, some of
the terms appear fitting, such as "petticoat" and "friend," though
others appear less so, such as "sailor." Overall, this visualization
demonstrates an understanding of gender which is perhaps not
altogether unexpected, but certainly challenges any coherent
conception of "woman" in this novel. In doing so, it keeps gender
ontology unresolved. As Pamela Caughie and her team work to visualize
gender ontology the life narrative of Lili Elbe, one of the first
persons to undergo gender affirmation surgery, they point out that
some issues with ontology /should/ remain unresolved: "Confusion in
gender and sexual terminologies... is part of the experienceof gender
and sexuality in the modernist era, something to be realized and
negotiated in readings of the narrative" (239). As Caughie and her
team struggle to mark gender shifts throughout the text in a way that
accords with the constraints of the archival methodology, they realize
that the issue with categorizing gender doesn't need a
solution. Rather, computational processes and models might be used to
capture the taxonomic chaos of gender ontology.

Although one may attempt to formalize such a method, my goal is not to
build reproducible schemas and models for analyzing gender in
novels. Rather, I look to harness opacity and unintelligibility as
resources for resisting inclusion. As Butler affirms, "radical and
inclusive representability is not precisely the goal" (/Bodies/
25). Resisting the logic of phallogocentrism, the process of
performative citation--of displacement through repetition--is meant to
preserve that which is excluded or unintelligible as a resource for
continual resignification, as "the point of departure for a set of
historical reflections and futural imaginings" (Butler /Bodies/ 173).

    I'm playing around with voyant tools on Giovanni's Room, and realizing
that my movements are carefully guided by this impression from textual
scholarship of deformance. At every step I am deforming the text,
creating a new text, with new potentials for reading. 

This deformance is an iterative process. 

There's a dip in the word "don't" toward the end of the novel, in
section 9. But when we get get the contexts into its own text
submission, there's a rise in this same sector. What's going on? 

Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter
five, a spike that is surrounded with a dearth of don'ts. This
explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

This activity calls for closer attention to the area of the spike, and
its surroundings.

What if we read only the sentences with the word "don't" in them?
