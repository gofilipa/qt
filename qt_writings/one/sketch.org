*** Pros Description: The first chapter, "Reading: 'Touching without
Touching,'" lays out what Digital Humanities methodologies might learn
from Queer Theory. This chapter looks at specific reading practices by
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Heather Love, which question the proper
relationship of the critic to the object of study. Sedgwick's ideas
about "touching/feeling" and Love's notion of "touching without
touching" pose queer modes of relationality that do not presume full
connections as prerequisite for analysis. This chapter engages these
techniques with various critical methods from the Digital Humanities,
including distant, surface, and post-critical reading, and
deformative, algorithmic, and speculative criticism. I pay particular
attention to how digital formats and interfaces might facilitate queer
critical methods, and I speculate on the intimate process of engaging
with literature on a computer, where users can manipulate and
transform text in virtually infinite and unique ways. Comparing three
very different kinds of digital projects based on text manipulation,
including the text analysis web application /Voyant-Tools/, the text
encoding archive, /Women Writers Online/, and a hypertext novella by
Caitlin Fischer, /These Waves of Girls/, I explain how these tools
work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what Jerome McGann calls a
“prosthetic extension of that demand for critical reflection,” by
which the reader is able to feel her way through the text (18). In
particular, I find that the haptic and exploratory activity of working
with these tools enlivens the reading process by allowing the reader
to play, experiment, and imagine new connections to the textual
object.


** intro to touch as reading method 
This section establishes the condition of being continually thwarted,
frustrated, eluded, as an affect of suspension or displacement that is
central to the experience of queerness, an affect called the
"untouchable."

*** touch intersects queer and digital, abstracting sense
At the intersection of queerness and the digital, touch operates by
abstracting its object through the intermediary of the sensible. This
process of abstraction compensates for the core condition of
queerness, which is untouchable, unknowable, and inexpressible.

*** /Waves/: queerness (story) is frustrating closure, eluding touch
The reader’s confusion in navigating through /Waves/ relates to the
work’s central theme of narration as seduction, piquing the reader's
interest in the story, propelling her through hyperlinks across the
various nodes, and repeatedly frustrating her desire for closure or
resolution, in a way that reinforces an approach toward queerness as
something elusive, a process that will never be complete.
 
*** Munoz's queerness as lack
Because queerness is "not yet here," it calls for something else,
expanding sensibility of feeling to include sensations beyond the
immediate, the readily sensible.

*** /confessions/: queerness and the denial of touch
In /Confessions/, maintaining the gap between sight and touch
stimulates the senses beyond what's possible within normative
expectations of sexual desire.


** the problem: queerness as untouchable, overreading
This section deconstructs the state of queerness as being
untouchable. We cannot capture, grasp, or access queerness, and we
look into methods of reading that try to ascertain truth or verify
facts. We conclude here that the proper position is hesitation,
restraint---touching at a distance.

*** TODO draft estrangement as central to queerness
“Editor’s Introduction”: Queering Archives, Intimate Tracings, 2015:
The estrangement that continually happens with dealing with
queerness. Estrangement from yourself, the materials, and others.

“Estrangement” --- the torment of queer literature -- the pain of not
identification but of not identifying. Of reading the text and finding
and not finding yourself in the pages.

*** TODO refine DisID points to the incommensurable: schutte 
Minority subjects struggle to be read into majoritarian systems of
identification, and rather experience disidentification, which
manifests as a choque, a collision of feelings, revealing an
incommensurable element, which cannot be resolved or verified.

*** TODO draft reading tries to resolve incommens: Amin & Musser
The illusion that we can gain sufficient knowledge into queer
experience, that such experiences are “commensurable,” drives certain
reading practices that critics describe as “paranoid” or “suspicious.

*** TODO revise paraonoia: sedgwick
Paranoid reading practices deliver results that are imaginable within
given knowledge structures, and close out other opportunities for
analysis.

*** TODO draft Scott & Kazanjian on overreading
the way that literary critics approach vision vs other fields

*** Paranoia and replication: haraway
We find parallels in epistemological methods from disciplines of
science (anthro) in which paranoia replicates assumptions. 

*** TODO add Barad on replication / representationalism
Barad makes a point about sciences being driven by replication. My
inquiry intersects with feminist scientific efforts

*** TODO refine paranoia and recovery: hartmann
For the historian of slavery, recovery is impossible within the terms
(language) of the dominant culture---schutte's incommensurability:
language cannot approximate the reality of experience.

*** Heather Love's queerness as failure, impossible
For Love, identification is about finding the moment when the subject
turns away: "Queer history has been an education in absence" (50.)
This moment of turning away characterizes queerness as something raw,
which cannot be captured.

*** TODO revise hesitation, critical distance is necessary: lowe
To avoid paranoid methods we develop a critical distance, we turn to
the ways that "touch" can be distanced. 

*** TODO revise the dimensions of touch: anzaldua
The challenge is to regain touch without resolving it, to touch
without presuming full connections
    
*** TODO refine /feeling backward/, touching at a distance 
Love offers a model of "feeling backward" which is a way for critics
to connect with queer subjects in a way that keeps objects out of the
critic's reach. 


** solution: abstraction, formalization, opacity
The harm of paranoia comes from a subject/object divide, where one
takes control/dominance over the other. But what if we found
alternative ways of making connections? This involves play and
speculation. It involves /formalizing what cannot be touched/ into a
touchable format. Playing with vantages, provisionality, performance!

*** TODO refine reparative reading is active
looking at reading as reparative opens up the way we understand
epistemology as about movement and performance, rather than
knowledge. 

*** TODO cut Waves on movement/performance/ ./
As I follow this disorienting narrative, I similarly enter into cycles
of desire and frustration. This affective reaction is only possible
through the formal structure of the narrative. 

*** TODO draft QPOC on opacity, recuperating absence
Hartmen's "critical fabulation" & Amber Musser's "surface aesthetics":
POC theorists have shown us how subjectivity is never quite
attainable, exists on a surface level. 

*** TODO add Confessions on opacity
the marbled page as an example of what cannot be said. Formal
experiments to present a self that is multiple, fragmented,
unreachable. We can only play with the pieces.
*** TODO revise invisibility is good, allows queers avoid being seen
As disidentified, queer subjects remain outside of the confines of the
visible. To gain visibility within the dominant system only reproduces
visibility within the terms of that system. 

*** TODO draft Toward a Queer Form
Writing the self is connected to form. Always. The form is
multiple. The form makes subjectivity opaque, but in the act of
abstraction, making it opaque, we can touch it and play around with
it. 

*** TODO draft Frontera on vitality to deformance?
the book as living and structured -- we are touching an abstraction

--> signposting: will see the equivalent of touching distantly in
deformance.


** on reproducible criticism
*** TODO add history of computing shows non-neutrality of tools
The way that computers are build/made is to perpetuate whiteness, the
status quo.

“The rise of the Net needs to be rooted in the 1960s-in both the
"closed world" of the Cold War and the open and decentralized world of
the antiwar movement and the counterculture. Understanding these dual
origins enables us to better understand current controversies over
whether the Internet will be "open" or "closed"-over whether the Net
will foster democratic dialogue or centralized hierarchy, community or
capitalism, or some mixture of both” (1531).

decentralization that a nuclear strike could create. 

“By spotlighting ARPA, Norberg and O'Neill emphasize what Hafner and Lyon sometimes obscure-the close connection of all ARPA computer funding to military concerns. Calling their concluding chapter "Serving the Department of Defense and Nation," they celebrate rather than downplay that link. They point out, for example, that ARPA only set up the IPTO in 1962 in response to pressure from the Kennedy administration for improved military command and control systems.16 Computers, it was widely believed, would make it possible to "control greater amounts of information and to present it in more effective ways to aid decision making” (1535).
Bob Kahn creating TCP/IP and “internetting” in order to connect different kinds of networks like satellites and radios.
“Computers created the technological possibility of the Cold War and shaped computer technology” (1538). 
“By placing the rise of the Internet within the 1960s-as-counterculture and the 1960s of the antiwar movement, Crocker and the Haubens suggest an alternative contextual frame to that emphasized by Edwards, who puts the rise of digital computing (and implicitly the Internet) solely within the Establishment 1960s of the Vietnam War and the Cold War.” (1545).
“Ironically, while the Department of Defense had very different goals in mind-and often tried to implement them by, for example, restricting access to the APRANET or to what it could be used for-its willingness to embrace the open technical standards embodied in TCP/IP inadvertently sparked the creation of a remarkably open system” (1549)
“By the 1980s (and especially by the 1990s), moreover, many of the people who had celebrated the freedom and openness of networks and personal computers had also undergone a transformation that made them inclined to accept this privatiza- tion. The affection of many "Netizens" for free speech and freedom from control had also come to embrace a love for free markets. The liberationism of the many early computer and network enthusiasts had been transformed into libertarianism.” (1550)
“Web search companies, which are seen as the portals to the Internet, are busily gobbling each other up or being acquired by larger media conglomerates. Bill Gates's Microsoft Corporation has a pretty good chance of controlling not only all of the personal computers from which people access the Internet but also the browsers through which they read pages on the World Wide Web. And Intel Corporation is poised to be the manufacturer of choice for the chips at the heart of those computers.” (1551)
    
**** Ruha Benjamin & Alondra Nelson on surveillance?
Nelson and Benjamin both talk about how the digital is predisposed toward presenting whiteness as invisible, universal, disembodied. (this follows from conceptions of the posthuman which prioritize intelligence over embodiment). Whiteness does not hold weight, it is not marked per se. Blackness is what stands out, gets marked, gets computed according to arbitrary metrics. It is computed to be poorer, more criminal, less qualified. 

*** TODO refine Underwood reproduces assumptions about binary gender
Assuming gender as a binary concept will create relationships of
opposition, a case in point of how the critic's entanglement
bakes results into analysis. 
**** TODO add Mandell on gender as social construction
*** TODO refine Nan Z Da on Reproducibility 
Reproducibility as a benchmark for quantitative methods enacts some of
the same harms as paranoid reading. Da's point on "reproducibility"
reveals an ultimately conservative investment in interpretive work as
something objectively, factually, effectively true.
*** TODO draft Altschuler and Weimar
They call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses," valuing reproduction
over remediation/deformance. In this view, digital becomes a means of
optimization, efficiency, total knowledge and understanding.
*** TODO refine Drucker's skewing the metrics
Drucker warps graphical metrics to suggest indeterminacy. 

*** TODO add the intersection btw queer & digit
The "desire for touching," without being able to fully touch, as the
definition of queerness, is also where the digital and queer
intersect. Digital media creates the illusion that we have access to
data, to information, but all we have access to is a *formalized*
relationship to that data. We encounter the digital object through
mediation, through an interface, mice, GUIs, keyboards, etc.


** TODO draft Value: Performativity
Digital formats and interfaces facilitate queer encounters methods, an
intimate process of engaging with literature on a computer, where
users can manipulate and transform text.
*** Bode's materiality, critque of Underwood

Katherine Bode's critique of Underwood points out that QLS methods
incorporate hidden assumptions about the data, about what is
findable. She offers a method that builds off the humanistic
approaches in textual scholarship and bibliography, where the model is
prior to computation. 

*** Tanya Clement: discovery

*** Against reproduction, for remediation/deformance 

*** McGann's "prosthetic extension" 
These tools work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what Jerome
McGann calls a “prosthetic extension of that demand for critical
reflection,” by which the reader is able to feel her way through the
text (18).
*** Critique of Underwood's "sensitivity"

Underwood overlooks the ways that distant reading can be a
prosthesis. Claims that Quantitative are not as "sensitive" or
"exacting" as close reading, and are mostly useful for long views. How
can we approach distant reading as multiplying alternative readings?
Rightly points out that human attention guides the scale of
analysis. So we have to be very careful at the question we are posing,
and the way that we interact with the computer.
    - "Critics who want to sensitively describe the merits of a single
      work usually have no need for statistics... Computational
      analysis of a text is more flexible than it used to be, but it
      is still quite crude compared to human reading; it helps mainly
      with questions where evidence is simple too big to fit in a
      single reader's memory" (xxi).
- Repeatedly stresses that the point of quantitative methods is to
  discover new scales of analysis, but he seems to be looking for an
  overarching theory that will encapsulate literary
  history. Quantitative methods seek to overcome a problem of
  attention, of memory, in order to gain a large view. Here, human
  memory is a hindrance, rather than a drive. The goal is rather to
  multiply alternative readings. 
    - Attention determines analysis, analysis determines knowledge,
      knowledge determines disciplines, periodization (8).
    - "The challenge is to find a perspective that makes the descriptions
      preferred by eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century
      scholars all congruent with each other" (32).

    - "The imprecision of the human world is part of the reason why
      numbers are so useful in social science: they allow researchers to
      describe continua instead of sorting everything into discrete
      categories" (Underwood 20).
