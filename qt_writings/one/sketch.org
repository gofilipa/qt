*** Pros Description: The first chapter, "Reading: 'Touching without
Touching,'" lays out what Digital Humanities methodologies might learn
from Queer Theory. This chapter looks at specific reading practices by
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Heather Love, which question the proper
relationship of the critic to the object of study. Sedgwick's ideas
about "touching/feeling" and Love's notion of "touching without
touching" pose queer modes of relationality that do not presume full
connections as prerequisite for analysis. This chapter engages these
techniques with various critical methods from the Digital Humanities,
including distant, surface, and post-critical reading, and
deformative, algorithmic, and speculative criticism. I pay particular
attention to how digital formats and interfaces might facilitate queer
critical methods, and I speculate on the intimate process of engaging
with literature on a computer, where users can manipulate and
transform text in virtually infinite and unique ways. Comparing three
very different kinds of digital projects based on text manipulation,
including the text analysis web application /Voyant-Tools/, the text
encoding archive, /Women Writers Online/, and a hypertext novella by
Caitlin Fischer, /These Waves of Girls/, I explain how these tools
work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what Jerome McGann calls a
“prosthetic extension of that demand for critical reflection,” by
which the reader is able to feel her way through the text (18). In
particular, I find that the haptic and exploratory activity of working
with these tools enlivens the reading process by allowing the reader
to play, experiment, and imagine new connections to the textual
object.


** intro to touch as reading method 
This section establishes the condition of being continually thwarted,
frustrated, eluded, as an affect of suspension or displacement that is
central to the experience of queerness, an affect called the
"untouchable."

*** touch intersects queer and digital, abstracting sense
At the intersection of queerness and the digital, touch operates by
abstracting its object through the intermediary of the sensible. This
process of abstraction compensates for the core condition of
queerness, which is untouchable, unknowable, and inexpressible.

*** /Waves/: queerness (story) is frustrating closure, eluding touch
The reader’s confusion in navigating through /Waves/ relates to the
work’s central theme of narration as seduction, piquing the reader's
interest in the story, propelling her through hyperlinks across the
various nodes, and repeatedly frustrating her desire for closure or
resolution, in a way that reinforces an approach toward queerness as
something elusive, a process that will never be complete.
 
*** Munoz's queerness as lack
Because queerness is "not yet here," it calls for something else,
expanding sensibility of feeling to include sensations beyond the
immediate, the readily sensible.

*** /confessions/: queerness and the denial of touch
In /Confessions/, maintaining the gap between sight and touch
stimulates the senses beyond what's possible within normative
expectations of sexual desire.


** the problem: queerness as untouchable, overreading
- This section deconstructs the state of queerness as being
  untouchable. 

Disidentification brings on a class of affects which point to the
element of incommensurability. We need to approach the incommensurable
as something that cannot be complete.

We conclude here that the proper position is hesitation, restraint. An
awareness of the need for hesitation, while also embracing
embodiment. The challenge is to regain touch without resolving it.

How do we touch without presuming full connections? We see Anzaldua's
standing at both sides at once, and Love's touching at a distance.

*** toward a reading method of the untouchable
This chapter will unpack a reading method that approaches queerness as
being "untouchable."

*** DisID points to the incommensurable: schutte 
Minority subjects struggle to be read into majoritarian systems of
identification, and rather experience disidentification, which
manifests as a choque, a collision of feelings, revealing an
incommensurable element, which cannot be resolved or verified.

*** TODO draft reading tries to resolve incommens
The illusion that we can gain sufficient knowledge into queer
experience, that such experiences are “commensurable,” drives certain
reading practices that critics describe as “paranoid” or “suspicious.

Visibility is a trap -- violence?

*** TODO revise paraonoia: sedgwick
Paranoid reading practices deliver results that are imaginable within
given knowledge structures, and close out other opportunities for
analysis.

*** TODO draft Scott & Kazanjian on overreading
the way that literary critics approach vision vs other fields

*** Paranoia and replication: haraway
We find parallels in epistemological methods from disciplines of
science (anthro) in which paranoia replicates assumptions. 

*** TODO add Barad on replication / representationalism
Barad makes a point about sciences being driven by replication. My
inquiry intersects with feminist scientific efforts

*** TODO refine paranoia and recovery: hartmann
For the historian of slavery, recovery is impossible within the terms
(language) of the dominant culture---schutte's incommensurability:
language cannot approximate the reality of experience.

*** Heather Love's queerness as failure, impossible
For Love, identification is about finding the moment when the subject
turns away: "Queer history has been an education in absence" (50.)
This moment of turning away characterizes queerness as something raw,
which cannot be captured.

*** TODO revise hesitation, critical distance is necessary: lowe
To avoid paranoid methods we develop a critical distance, we turn to
the ways that "touch" can be distanced. 

*** TODO revise the dimensions of touch: anzaldua
The challenge is to regain touch without resolving it, to touch
without presuming full connections
    
*** TODO refine /feeling backward/, touching at a distance 
Love offers a model of "feeling backward" which is a way for critics
to connect with queer subjects in a way that keeps objects out of the
critic's reach. 


** solution: abstraction, formalization, opacity
The harm of paranoia comes from a subject/object divide, where one
takes control/dominance over the other. But what if we found
alternative ways of making connections? This involves play and
speculation. It involves /formalizing what cannot be touched/ into a
touchable format. Playing with vantages, provisionality, performance!

*** TODO refine reparative reading is active
looking at reading as reparative opens up the way we understand
epistemology as about movement and performance, rather than
knowledge. 

*** TODO cut Waves on movement/performance/ ./
As I follow this disorienting narrative, I similarly enter into cycles
of desire and frustration. This affective reaction is only possible
through the formal structure of the narrative. 

*** TODO draft QPOC on opacity, recuperating absence
Hartmen's "critical fabulation" & Amber Musser's "surface aesthetics":
POC theorists have shown us how subjectivity is never quite
attainable, exists on a surface level. 

*** TODO add Confessions on opacity
the marbled page as an example of what cannot be said. Formal
experiments to present a self that is multiple, fragmented,
unreachable. We can only play with the pieces.
*** TODO revise invisibility is good, allows queers avoid being seen
As disidentified, queer subjects remain outside of the confines of the
visible. To gain visibility within the dominant system only reproduces
visibility within the terms of that system. 

*** TODO draft Toward a Queer Form
Writing the self is connected to form. Always. The form is
multiple. The form makes subjectivity opaque, but in the act of
abstraction, making it opaque, we can touch it and play around with
it. 

*** TODO draft Frontera on vitality to deformance?
the book as living and structured -- we are touching an abstraction

--> signposting: will see the equivalent of touching distantly in
deformance.


** on reproducible criticism
This section sets up the conversation about how digital methods
evacuate complexity and difference, by going into the history of
technological development and revealing the assumptions and values
encoded into the technology.

*** contextualize development of digital tech
The internet, a technology credited with democratizing information,
communication, access, actually arose from a national security
consideration, to improve military communication. 

Operating systems, which make possible the running of computers are
built by white men and display their cultural values in emphasis on
modularity, transparency, etc. 

Today, the development of surveillance tech furthers this, presenting
whiteness as something invisible, universal, disembodied. 

*** TODO refine Underwood reproduces assumptions about binary gender
Assuming gender as a binary concept will create relationships of
opposition, a case in point of how the critic's entanglement
bakes results into analysis.

*** TODO refine Nan Z Da on Reproducibility 
Reproducibility as a benchmark for quantitative methods enacts some of
the same harms as paranoid reading. Da's point on "reproducibility"
reveals an ultimately conservative investment in interpretive work as
something objectively, factually, effectively true.

*** TODO draft Altschuler and Weimar
They call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses," valuing reproduction
over remediation/deformance. In this view, digital becomes a means of
optimization, efficiency, total knowledge and understanding.

*** TODO refine Drucker's skewing the metrics
Drucker warps graphical metrics to suggest indeterminacy. 

*** TODO add the intersection btw queer & digit
The "desire for touching," without being able to fully touch, as the
definition of queerness, is also where the digital and queer
intersect. Digital media creates the illusion that we have access to
data, to information, but all we have access to is a *formalized*
relationship to that data. We encounter the digital object through
mediation, through an interface, mice, GUIs, keyboards, etc.


** TODO draft Value: Performativity
--> Digital formats and interfaces facilitate an intimate process of
engaging with literature on a computer, where users can unlock the
dynamicity of texts. This performative elements allows unique and
alternative reading paths. 

*** the value of alterneity over reproduction: performance
We move away from the reproducible to the performative, exploring
active elements of analysis, the sensible engagement between critic
and text

*** Bode's materiality, critque of Underwood
Bode emphasizes attention to the apparatus. 

*** Critique of Underwood's "sensitivity"
Distant reading can be sensitive, harnessing the attention span of
the reader to present new pathways through text. 

*** Tanya Clement: discovery
                


** TODO draft Value: Vantanges
case in point: /Voyant-Tools/
*** Klein, Mandell, Caughie, Gaboury
*** Against totalization
*** The visible and the invisible, opting out 
jacob gaboury


** TODO Value: Provisionality 
case in point: some text encoding?
*** Susan Brown's provisionality
*** Julia Flander's work on Orlando 
*** Against stability 


** Digital projects based on text manipulation: 
I find that the haptic and exploratory activity of working with these
tools enlivens the reading process by allowing the reader to play,
experiment, and imagine new connections to the textual object.

*** /Voyant-Tools/
Jerome McGann "prosthetic extensions"
Potential texts: Woolf's /Orlando/. 

- Interweave a narrative about touch. Taking new materialist ideas but
placing them within context of QPOC critiqe. Anzaldua and Bennet on
touch and severing. Sarah Ahmed too. 

*** /These Waves of Girls/
Following narrative desire. The click of the mouse allows readers to
move with the text, based on their own paths. 

*** what are some print texts that enact these principles of movement?
- Alison Bechdel's "Are You My Mother": where every page is vibrating
with reference. 


** MISC
*** incommensurability, numbers are just as ambiguous
    - "The imprecision of the human world is part of the reason why
      numbers are so useful in social science: they allow researchers to
      describe continua instead of sorting everything into discrete
      categories" (Underwood 20).
