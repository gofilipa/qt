This dissertation looks at new ways of reading <i>queer bodies</i> and
<i>queer subjectivity</i> within technological contexts. How do digital
tools and platforms change the way we interact with queer
subjects/affects/embodiments within texts? What about the digital
allows us to activate <i>sensational</i> reading experiences? In simpler
words, how does digital media interface with queerness?
</p>

<p>
This chapter proposes a reading methodology that leverages the
critic's relationship to the text to open possibilities for
interpretation and connections to the textual material. It explores
the ways that reading practices across two different fields (digital
humanities and queer theory) intertwine, and how this creates a new
method for reading queer narratives in digital contexts. The burden of
the chapter is to describe how queerness and data are mediated, and
can/should be engaged critically as constructions, formalizations,
that draw attention to their own mediation.
</p>

<p>
First, queerness is established as something that can only be touched
"at a distance," because the queer subject cannot be redeemed or
recovered. This impulse to satisfy, redeem, or recover queerness is
observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading practices, which seek
to answer or discover the “hidden” meaning within text. These
practices attempt to answer questions, but do so in a way that
constrains inquiry, because paranoia only delivers the results that
are <i>imaginable</i> within current the knowledge structures. To avoid
reproducing these knowledge structures, we must look to strategies
that do not assume full connections, look to queer affects, like
<i>queerness as not yet here</i>, <i>touching/feeling</i>, <i>feeling
backward</i>. We value abstraction, or <i>queer form</i>, which is necessary
for bringing things into relation, and opacity, which keeps the
unknowable nature of queer experience and identity somewhat in
tact. We look at <i>Confessions of the Fox</i>, <i>These Waves of Girls</i>,
<i>Borderlands</i>.
</p>

<p>
Second, we examine a similar impulse in DH&#x2014;and a parallel across the
status of queerness and data, which cannot be captured in their raw
forms. The history of computing and media shows how tools were built
in ways that are not neutral, and we find DH practitioners doing work
that is critical of digital methods. Looking at the example of DH from
the position of queerness we see more clearly the necessity of
opacity, formalization, and abstraction as reading methods, and the
real danger of reproducibility and totalization, byproducts of
paranoia. We find parallels between queer critics and feminist DHers,
who are doing something similar; we interweave Saidiya Hartman and
Lauren Klein.
</p>

<p>
Third, we propose three values for queer DH, which is: novelty (the
performative), vantages (the visual), and provisionality (the
ontological). We see these examples in <i>voyant-tools</i>, <i>these waves
of girls</i>, and /the orlando project/(?).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-0-1-2">
<p>
The three heavy footnotes in the beginning, are tripping people up, a
bit overwhelming. Work on spreading this out. In doing so, luxuriate
in the idea of how digital etymology relates to the idea of touch.
</p>

<p>
clarify specific terms/concepts: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Who is <b><b>Matt Kirschenbaum</b></b>? Characterize him a little bit for
outsiders. Situate myself in relation to him. Also consider taking
out or reducing the footnote on materiality, because it's tripping
people up.</li>
<li>Explain why I am choosing this word <b><b>formalization</b></b> to describe a
construct. What does this term do that "construct" cannot do?
Another sentence on what I mean here.</li>
<li>What Queer theory am I using, at <b><b>reconsolidation</b></b>. The
abstraction of the queer subject. (related to the issue of
positioning myself w/ regard to queer theory: The ways that queer
subjectivity is constructed differently in early poststructrualism,
as opposed to affect theory. Affect theory tries to bring the body
back, thinking to Sara Ahmed vs Foucault). In addition to defining
my position/sources, also consider how "queer" can be reclaimed by
those it is meant to oppress (Butler, 'Critically Queer').</li>
<li><b><b>the sensual fullness of a lack</b></b>: see butler on beauvoir and
irigaray, two women together as a double lack, in gender
trouble. <i>When our two lips touch</i>, Irigaray</li>
<li>see how <b><b>haptic</b></b> is being deployed in other disciplines.</li>
<li>what do I mean by <b><b>touch as abstraction</b></b> on page 3? The physical
experience of touch may be an abstraction, or abstracted, but it is
not experienced as such. Jacob: "Touch often registers as painful
immediacy". See Ann Cvetkovitch's writing on Stone Butch Blues.</li>
<li>on page 3, I'm making sweeping claims about the <b><b>Queer
Subject</b></b>. Is there a single queer subject, a queer subjectivity? Do
the narrators demonstrate this? If so, what is that kind of queer?</li>
</ul>

<p>
More broadly: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how does the digital relate to the <b><b>body</b></b>? how does it change the
body? how does queerness do this? &#x2013;&gt; Butler's points about how a
body doesn't come into being until contact in <i>Bodies that Matter</i>.</li>
<li>what am I doing with <b><b>touch more broadly</b></b>? why is this chapter
about touch?</li>
<li>emphasize that I'm doing this <b><b>new thing</b></b>, this new field. DH can
help us theorize the queer; and queer can help us understand the
Digital.</li>
<li>clarify the relationship between <b><b>removal, touch, and grasp</b></b>. How
are these distinct?</li>
</ul>

<p>
In close readings, <b><b>the various registers of touch</b></b> are at odds.  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I start the chapter by saying that queer and the digital are related
through touch, then I assert that it is a troubled relationship to
touch. Make it clear at the start that I'm thinking about touch as a
complicated activity/phenomenon, not touch as always making
contact.</li>
<li>How the implications of touch are slightly different or opposite to
each other across the close readings. One is frustrated touch and
one touch opens up. Establish the connection between the two.</li>
<li>There's a tension between literal touch (touching the text) and
figurative touch (touch as a trope, touch via sight). Emphasize and
distinguish the difference between touch as a figure within the text
and as a means of engaging without the text. Additionally, on the
literal side, how is this touch (clicking through) different from
turning the page?</li>
<li>revise the close reading of <i>waves</i> to include analysis of the beam
routine. How is touch operating? there is no touch in this scene.</li>
<li>the paradox of touch: the untouchable is good &#x2014; it is a paradox. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the paradox of touch: touching w/o touching</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-1-0-1-3-2">
<p>
We are building an understanding of queer subjectivity that is based
on affect. In the experience of disidentification (Munoz), there is an
feeling of a choque (Anzaldua), a clash of affects, an embodied
experience. That experience contains an element of the incommensurable
(Schutte), a gap. This gap is what is untouchable about queer
experience (Cvetkovitch). It is an affective experience that exceeds
language and discourse.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
If digital humanists and queer theorists are going to find some common
ground, they might start with <i>touch</i>. Touch is a means of interfacing
with the world, an encounter between subject and object, which signals
a problem of access<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> that applies to both electronic media and
queer subjectivity. Associations between the digital<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> and touch
expand from numerical computation (the ten "digits" of the hand) to
signify the haptic connections made through the intermediaries of
mice, keyboards, and touch screens. Crucially, these intermediaries
demonstrate that humans engage with electronic data at a remove,
through layers of computation, abstraction, formalization<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. New
Media theorist Matt Kirschenbaum explains that “[d]igital inscription
is a form of displacement. Its fundamental characteristic is to remove
digital objects from the channels of direct human intervention”
(<i>Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</i> 86). Moving to
the context of queerness, touch similarly points to a problem of
access. Like digital media, queer subjectivity has been theorized as
legible by and through the framework of formalization&#x2013;specifically,
through a heteronormative power structure that delineates the queer
subject for the purpose of reconsolidation. As queer theorists like
Judith Butler have shown, subjectivity is constructed through
discursive and performative processes:<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> "Where there is an 'I'
who utters or speaks and thereby produces an effect in discourse,
there is first a discourse which precedes and enables that 'I' and
forms in language the constraining trajectory of its will"
("Critically Queer" 18). At the intersection of the digital and
queerness, then, the phenomenon of touch indexes our grasp of the
subject as a construct, a formalization.
</p>

<p>
This examination harnesses the formal qualities of both queer
subjectivity and digital media. It supposes that the parallels between
data and queer subjectivity might coalesce into an approach toward
reading, which engages queer subject matter and digital media through
the matrix of touch. Touch is an approach toward reading that provides
alternative possibilities and pathways for sensation. My reading will
demonstrate how touch offers a means of knowing based on feeling,
which works by abstracting sensation beyond the readily sensible. This
process of abstraction compensates for the constructed nature of queer
subjectivity by exploring queerness as emergent<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> within digital
media. My readings will surface new forms, <i>queer forms</i>, that evoke
digital materialities and aesthetics as formalizations of the
immaterial.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>

<li><a id="org0973541"></a>Margot's point about queerness of two strains<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-1-1-1">
<p>
Margot says that in the first paragraph I'm drawing from canonical
post-structural definition of queerness, which is produced
discursively/performatively, where queerness is abstract and purely
discursive. Soon after, however, I move into queerness as affect,
which emphasizes the body's materiality, how subjects come into
existence through contact.
</p>

<p>
In this paragraph I am trying to prove that queerness is concerned
with touch. How is queerness concerned with touch? Because queerness
is something that we cannot touch directly. It is something that can
only be sensualized, abstracted, mediated. So it's important for me to
point out that queer subjectivity is something that has been talked
about as discursive, then there's been a move toward affect. It is
this move toward the affective queerness as a formalization which I
will be focusing on. I need to replace the reference to foucault with
an emphasis of Butler/Ahmed on the body.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
Two close-readings will serve to demonstrate that queerness is
concerned with touch, and more precisely, with <i>a desire for touch</i>
that is continually frustrated. Though one is from a digital source
and the other from print, both examples demonstrate a self-conscious
and critical stance about its own form, a key component of what I will
later elaborate as <i>queer form</i>.
</p>

<p>
The first text, entitled <i>These Waves of Girls</i> by Caitlin Fisher,
figures touching as desire quite literally, with touch being the means
of pursuing desire. This "hypertext," an electronic text format that
links "nodes" or pages within an associative structure, enacts desire
by tempting the reader to click through the various episodes of the
story in order to achieve narrative closure. <i>Waves</i> is an
autobiographical account of the author's sexual coming-of-age, which
unfolds in a series of interconnected vignettes that recount Fisher's
adolescent experiences with men and women. Despite winning the 2001
Electronic Literature Organization Award, this "hypertext novella"
draws criticism for a formal structure that complicates a
straightforward reading experience. Through the profusion of
hyperlinks, which connect one node to the next in ways that disrupt
temporal and causal relations, this hypertext frustrates the reader’s
desire for narrative coherence. One critic argues that the
use of hyperlinks “present[s] a baffling range of choices for movement
which actually led to a stifling of movement altogether” (Pope,
“Significance”).
</p>

<p>
!["DARE" &gt; "I liked girls&#x2026;" &gt; "the lover" &gt; "Only one of us is
15&#x2026;" &gt; "Jerk off…"](../qt<sub>writings</sub>/one/videos/erotic.gif)
</p>

<p>
The disorienting feeling of reading this text is an effect of its
form.  The conventional reading practice of turning the pages in a
codex dissolves in the distracting and technical complexity of a
narrative that requires effort to traverse. Episodes do not have a
discernible chronology or progression, and clicking on the links
between nodes disrupts any sense of coherence. While the desire for
narrative closure is continually frustrated by the work's form, in
another sense, this fragmentary structure exactly constitutes its
appeal, for it compels the reader to chase an elusive understanding of
sexuality, as the text continually defies the reader’s expectations
about the narrator's motives. In one repeatedly linked node, aptly
titled “erotic,” the words “and it was the most erotic year of my
life” march across the screen like ticker tape (“And it was&#x2026;”). This
node is accessed through two different sources, both featuring sexual
episodes between the narrator and men. In a novella that largely
consists of stories about the narrator’s sexual history and fantasies
with other women, these nodes are unusual, checking the reader’s
expectations about the narrator’s identity and desire. The
accumulation of seemingly capricious sexual episodes disrupts the
relationship between cause and effect, scrambling the reader's sense
of direction across the text. Other moments in the text create a
similar dissonance from the associations the narrator's motives. One
occurs in the last node of the “beam routine” episode, when the
narrator is about to perform gymnastics to placate a man that she
brought home. The link reads “I don’t want to have sex,” and it leads
the reader back to a familiar episode about "Jennie Winchester":
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’m in bed with Jennie Winchester and I realize she wants me to undo
her pants. She needs to be home by 11:00 and needs to leave my place
by 10:45. I’m kissing her but opening my eyes at intervals to catch
the clock. At exactly 10:43 I unbutton her Levis and shove my hand
inside, barely undoing the zipper. “I’m in bed&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As the reader familiarizes herself with the events of the story, she
is always losing context. Now the reader experiences this familiar
node in a new way that casts its former meaning into doubt. What is
the connection between this episode and the phrase, "I don't want to
have sex"? Why is the narrator watching the clock? Because the
character's desires have been muddled by the unpredictable connections
between episodes, what at first seems straightforward now appears to
support alternate readings. The reader’s confusion in navigating
through <i>Waves</i>, in re-interpreting fragments that had been previously
integrated, reinforces queer identity as something elusive, a
condition that is not fully intelligible. Clicking (<i>touching</i>) her
way through the narrative, the reader is repeatedly reminded of her
removal from the distance from the narrator.

<h4 id="org4a6401b"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.3</span> <i>Confessions</i>: queerness and the denial of touch</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<p>
For queer subjects, touch and the desire for touching has always been
a frought experience, which can in turn activates a sensorium of
affects. In my second example, <i>The Confessions of the Fox</i> by Jordy
Rosenberg, the main character exhibits a troubled relationship to
touch which partly constitutes his subjectivity. Beginning in
eighteenth century London, this story follows Jack Sheppard, a young
transgender male as a wily thief amid a group of "rogues."  Before the
official pathologization of nonnormative desires and identities,
Sheppard struggles to articulate his difference, what he calls his
"<i>Something</i>:" "This something that set him apart from other coves
[men]. Something that had caus'd him to dress his own chest in taut
bandages&#x2026; pinching at his ribs, throttling his every Breath to a
forced shallow bird-sipping of the air" (33). The hesitance toward
self-identification extends from the main character to the narrative's
genre, which unfolds as historical fiction overlaid with contemporary
fictional memoir. Sheppard's story is discovered in the present day
United States by Dr. Voth, a rueful academic who is also
transgender. Voth, who immediately recognizes the historical
significance of Sheppard's manuscript, proceeds to annotate the
document with relevant references and increasingly, his own tangential
anecdotes. In one scene of the manuscript, Sheppard is having a
romantic moment when Voth relates his own episode about a former
lover:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
She opened her legs a bit, twitched them open, really. I caught my
breath, audibly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh my god," she said, "you're such a lesbian."
</p>

<p>
She didn't mean it cruelly. And she didn't mean that I wasn't passing
as a cis-man, either. Although, since according to her we'd fucked the
night before, she knew exactly how un-cis I was. 
</p>

<p>
She meant that she saw something about the quality of my desire: that
I could feel her even before I touched her. And that this was part of
what it meant to be&#x2014;or to have been, before my tits became property
of the California Municipal Waste Department&#x2014;a lesbian. That a woman
moving in your line of sight could have an effect that was total,
atmospheric. That you could be hesitant, incapable, and not
particularly interested in establishing a line between touching and
seeing. That you would indulge a dead love, dead in the eyes of the
world, and valueless. A love that choked and burdened the mind, that
might even be the very foundation of melancholy and despair. But, oh
Reader, looking at a woman you really get a feel for the way that fire
is a phenomenon of touch. And my point is, if you have every been a
lesbian, you will not even have to touch a woman to know that. 169
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, desire is characterised not by the search for satisfaction, or
the success of establishing contact, but by the sensual fullness of a
lack. The experience of desire, of craving, wanting, needing to touch
the desired object stimulates the imagination and amplifies sensations
that would otherwise be replaced with more "direct" modes of
contact. The lover's reference to Dr. Voth as "such a lesbian" brings
this distinction about physical and imaginary contact to the realm of
identity, reinforcing the interplay between imaginary and real when it
comes to touch. Though Dr. Voth is not a lesbian, the term fits
because it signals not a gender or sexual identity but a sensuality
that is more concerned with the potential of connection rather than
verifiable contact. The appellation hinges on the role of the
imagination in activating certain sensations&#x2013;"total,"
"atmospheric"&#x2014;that supercede those in the actualized
world. Therefore, Dr. Voth's visual fancy takes on connotations of the
fanciful. But this does not mean the sensations resulting from this
desire are any less palpable. On the contrary, such a desire maximizes
physical experience: it is a desire for something that, because it
cannot or will not be fulfilled, amplifies the fullness of that
desire. This mode of desiring is what characterizes queerness in the
text. Here, touch, or the lack of touch, defines a peculiarly queer
subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
In both <i>Waves</i> and <i>Confessions</i>, queerness is constituted by a
troubled relationship to touch, reinforcing queerness as something
that cannot be grasped or is beyond grasp. In <i>Waves</i>, touch is the
continually frustrated means for traversing the narrative: clicking
her way though the nodes, the reader fails to grasp the arc of the
story or the intentions of the narrator. In <i>Confessions</i>, denying
touch casts queer identity as something beyond
categorization. Maintaining the gap between sight and touch stimulates
the senses beyond what's possible within normative expectations of
sexual desire. This condition of inaccessibility gestures at an affect
of suspension or displacement that is central to the experience of
queerness, an affect that I call the "untouchable," which we now
explore in depth.

<p>
The idea of the "untouchable" builds off queer theorists who have
isolated a queer experience of displacement, estrangement, or a
feeling of a lack that creates a space for emergent affects. This
experience derives from the political and social environment that
attempts to erase the existence of minorty subjects, particularly
queer people of color. Even as LGBT groups appear to gain more
visibily and acceptance, such gains are trapped within the limiting,
normative time of the present (citation to munoz).

[expand this idea about normativization of queerness, with reference
to Bostock v. Clayton County&#x2014;the major opinion bans discrimination

protection because straights have it. This is not expanding our
protection of desire to include queer forms of love, it is just
extending an antiquated view. The dissent by Alito is on the grounds
of "sex," which does not cover sexual orientation or gender ID, and by
Kavanaugh on the constraints of the court, who cannot legislate new
law but can only judge prior law. I agree with Alito &amp; Kavanaugh, as
they point to the pitfalls of heteronormativity, though I am happy
with the result.]
</p>

<p>
This chapter explores potential positions or orientations around
queerness. It begins by establishing queer subjectivity on the basis
of affect, and unpacks a core condition of queerness as "untouchable."
By "untouchable," I mean that queer identity is constituted through a
sensation of a lack, through the sensation of absence, contour,
boundary, edge, exclusion. This is opposed to majority
subject-formation, wherein "[t]he fiction of identity is one that is
accessed with relative ease" (Muñoz <i>Disidentifications</i> 5). In what
follows, I locate "untouchability" in the affective experiences that
constitute subjectivity, experiences that isolate moments of
strangeness, disjunction, irony, ambivalence, and chaos. These
affective experiences center on a quality of incommensurability that
is the defining condition of untouchability [and will later become the
criterion of touching without touching]. This foundational quality of
the incommensurable, which makes queerness "untouchable," influences
our approach <i>as critics</i> toward queer texts, themes, and
subjects. For queer readers in particular, there is a desire to
recognize within the past something that affirms queer experience in
the present, making acts of identification that collapse or overlook
the complexity of experience. Heather Love describes queer critics,
"Like demanding lovers [who] promise to rescue the past when in fact
they dream of being rescued themselves" (33). This chapter proposes a
reading method that enables queerness to be grasped, but at a
distance. The attention to affect provides the ground to remagine
reading as situated within the reader's embodied relationship to the
text.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
This chapter unpacks the condition of "the untouchable" from theories
of identity and communication developed by Queer Theorists from Latinx
backgrounds and traditions, including Muñoz, Ofelia Schutte, and
Gloria Anzaldúa. My approach toward subjectivity is based on a
paradigm of identity formation that Muñoz generalizes as
"identities-in-difference" (<i>Disidentifications</i> 6). Muñoz's
identities-in-difference marshalls theories of difference from Chicanx
theorists Norma Alarcón's idea of "differential consciousness" and
Chela Sandova's concept of emergent identities-in-difference, which
center moments of failed interpellation as the core materials of
subject formation. Muñoz's work on identity offers a space for
prioritizing the role of affect in subject formation.
</p>

<p>
According to Muñoz, queer subjectivity grows from an affective
experience that he describes as "disidentification." Disidentification
describes how minority subjects negotiate identity in a cultural
sphere that disregards their existence. Due to "cultural logics of
heteronormativity, white supremacy, and misogyny," queer people of
color have been placed outside majority ideas about race, sexuality,
gender, and class, that constitute dominant society
(<i>Disidentifications</i> 5). As a result, minority experience is defined
by a gap in identification, where subjectivity emerges in the failure
to adhere to social expectations. Within this gap, dominant
signfications of identity are not totally inaccessible to minority
subjects. Rather, they are accessed according to a process of
"disidentification," where subjects find alternative pathways of
connection to that which remains beyond their grasp. These moments are
fleeting sensations of finding oneself attracted to something that is
inappropriate, "<i>to read onesself</i> and one's own life narrative in a
moment, object, or subject that is not culturally coded to 'connect'
with the disidentifying subject" (<i>Disidentifications</i> 12; my
italics). Muñoz offers his own formative experience of
disidentification from a childhood memory of watching Truman Capote on
TV:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I remember, for instance, seeing an amazingly queeny Truman Capote
describe the work of fellow writer Jack Kerouac as not writing but,
instead, typing. I am certain that my pre-out consciousness was
completely terrified by the swishy spectacle of Capote's
performance. But I also remember feeling a deep pleasure in hearing
Capote make language, in "getting" the fantastic bitchiness of his
quip [&#x2026;] I can locate that experience of suburban spectatorship as
having a disidentificatory impact on me. Capote's performance was as
exhilarating as it was terrifying. <i>Disidentifications</i> 4
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This memory is distinguished by a powerful disjunction between
opposite feelings, which consitutes identity from ambivalent
affects. The exhilaration that Muñoz feels when he understands
Capote's dig is compounded by the surprise of catching its "fanstastic
bitchiness." But this upheaval is attended by another feeling, a fear
of recognition, which is a foundational affect for queer
subjectivity. Kelly Caldwell, a poet and academic, explains in "The
Torment of Queer Literature" that "embracing queerness is often
embracing abjection" (par. 4). She describes her disidentificatory
experience reading James Baldwin's novel <i>Giovanni's Room</i> as a
transgender woman, with "the risk of recognizing David’s denial and
repression as my own" (par. 17). Caldwell wonders, "what if the only
available act of identification is one of stigma and shame? [&#x2026;]
Sometimes identification is loss and despair" (par. 4). For Caldwell,
the process of "reading oneself&#x2026; in a moment, object, or subject
that is not culturally coded" is self-shattering.
</p>

<p>
In Muñoz's experience watching Capote, disidentification emerges in
the space between the opposing sensations of pleasure and terror. This
sensation of opposing affects and the shattering of identity has been
well explored by queer Chicana Theorist Gloria Anzaldúa. For Anzaldúa,
the figure of <i>la mestiza</i><sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> denotes the experience of being
mixed, at the intersection of two opposing forces. The
mestiza-&#x2014;"[c]radled in one culture, sandwiched between two
cultures"&#x2014;has the capacity to contain dualities, such as
male/female, English/Spanish, American/Mexican (78). Mestiza
consciousness is about hybridity, holding a tolerance for ambiguity,
for existing in the middle space that contains dualities. This
consciousness manifests in what Anzaldúa describes as the experience
of <i>el choque</i>, or the shock: "The coming together of two
self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference"
(78). The affective experience of <i>el choque</i>," a cultural collision,"
consists of a bodily phenomenon where the subject receives multiple
opposing messages that incite a physical upheaval (78). The choque
occurs at the intersection of cultures, and also within culture:
"Through our mothers, the culture gave us mixed messages: <i>No voy a
dejar que ningun pelado desgraciado maltrate a mis hijos</i>. And in the
next breath it would say, <i>La-mujer tiene que hacer lo que le diga el
hombre</i>" (40). The clash of "mixed messages" results in mental and
emotional states of confusion and despair: "The mestiza's dual or
multiple personality is plagued by psychic restlessness" (78). It is
an embodied experience of physical and pyschic unsettlement that is a
basis for identity formation. 
</p>

<p>
The choque experienced in acts of queer disidentification points to a
core quality of queerness that is incommensurable. Latina feminist
philosopher Ofelia Schutte's modeling of cross-cultural
communication isolates a quality that is useful for understanding the
productive effects of the choque. Schutte, who draws from feminist
postcolonial and poststructuralist concepts of alterity and
difference, writes about communication between native English and
Spanish speakers. Her goal is to explore how subjects from different
cultures might achieve effective conversation, "to communicate with
'the other' who is culturally different from oneself"
(53). Communication begins with the assumption that "no two cultures
or languages can be perfectly transparent to each other" (56). There
is something lost in translation, "a residue of meaning that will not
be reached in cross-cultural endeavors" (56). This vestige of
communication that fails to transfer between subaltern and dominant
subjects is what she calls the incommensurable element. Schutte goes
into detail to explain how the incommensurable emerges in
conversation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In cross-cultural communication, each speaker may "say" something that
falls on the side of the "unsaid" for a culturally differentiated
interlocutor. Such gaps in communication may cause one speaker's
discourse to appear incoherent or insufficiently organized. To the
culturally dominant speaker, the subaltern speaker's discourse may
appear to be a string of fragmented observations rather than a unified
whole. The actual problem may not be incoherence but the lack of
cultural translatability of the signifiers for coherence from one set
of cultural presuppositions to the other. 62
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The question of how to speak to those different from us allows one to
productively think through how queer subjects integrate their own
difference from society.
</p>

<p>
The point of isolating incommensurability is not to try to grasp or
translate the vestige of lost meaning, but to recognize that gap as a
space that constitutes subjectivity. We need to recongize this
incommensurability because it is a gap that opens up space for
emergent affects. Schutte's model emphasizes the productive effects of
attending to these gaps and ellisions. She encourages attention to the
ways in which "the other's speech, or some aspect of it, resonates in
me as a kind of strangeness, as a kind of displacement of the usual
expectation" (56). Schutte proposes that one embrace the strangeness
of communication, locating the moments where meaning seems to slip by
and elude us. By paying attention to the awkward and even bizarre
moments of misunderstanding, we find the materials for constructing
new dis(identity).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<p>
The goal here is to preserve the incommensurable in analysis. We want
to give full rein to the elements that escape and elude
understanding. We must first look at methods that attempt to resolve
incommensurability, and see how they reduce or flatten the complexity
of queer subjectivity &amp; experience.
</p>

<p>
The reality of incommensurability points to ways that understanding
will always be flawed, never complete, and never self-evident. The
illusion that we can gain sufficient understanding about queer
experience, that such experiences are "commensurable," drives certain
reading practices that critics describe as "paranoid" or "suspicious."
This reading practice assumes experience and subjectivity to be
fundamentally accessible. Here, the reading method pursues knowledge
as a goal in and of itself. To illustrate this effect, Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick relates a conversation between herself and a friend during
few years of the AIDS crisis, when speculation about the government's
complicity in spreading the virus is rampant. At the time, Sedgwick
wonders whether "the lives of African Americans are worthless in the
eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap
where they aren't actively hated" (123). Her friend counters this
suspicion, pointing out that knowledge of conspiracy doesn't achieve
anything on its own: "Supposing we were ever sure of all those
things&#x2014;what would we know then that we don't already know?"
(123). Merely knowing that something is true, revealing the presence
of systematic oppression, injustice, discrimination, does nothing. As
Sedgwick explains, knowledge of a problem is not enough to "enjoin
that person to any specific train of epistemological or narrative
consequences" (123). Moreover, a paranoid or suspicious stance blocks
out other possibilities for relation to the text. Paranoia often only
affirms itself; reflecting and replicating itself in every surface,
giving too much power to the act of exposure. The work of paranoia is
never done, "for all its vaunted suspicion, [paranoia] acts as though
its work would be accomplished if only it could finally, this time,
somehow get its story truly known" (141). Like many other theorists,
Sedgwick wonders what is the point of continually trying to reveal,
unravel, deconstruct the injustices of the past. She searches for
"some ways of understanding human desire that might be quite to the
side of prohibition and repression, that might hence be structured
quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory,' inescapably dualistic
righteousness of hunting down and attacking prohibition/repression in
all its chameleonic guises" (10).

<p>
To examine the way that paranoid reading works, it is useful to
explore its workings in other disciplines. There is a lot we can learn
from history and science, in particular, about the ways that paranoid
reading collapses complexity and perpetuates established forms of
knowledge. Historicist literary scholar David Kazanjian explains how
the charge of "overreading," or the accusation that critics attribute
contemporary meaning to a historical text, presumes a strict
separation between historically contextualized reading and ahistorical
reading. Kazanjian points out that those who level this accusation
assume that so-called "historical" perspectives are accessible, "as if
one inhabited the same historical scene as the text one is reading"
("Scenes of Speculation," 80). Similar assumptions are made in
science, which in particular, demonstrate how paranoia enacts a
self-replicating mechanic. Though it appears in much of literary
studies, the impulse that drives paranoid reading is borrowed from a
critical viewpoint in scientific inquiry that assumes a detached
observer. Critiques of this position, particularly in Donna Haraway's
work on primatology, attempt to articulate a new mode of feminist
science that de-naturalizes the "natural." Haraway's research on
primates reveals the ways in which assumptions and preconceptions from
the (white, male) subject inflect the object of study. She examines
how scientists bring their own investments to bear even in the
seemingly benign questions they might ask, or qualities they isolate,
as areas of interest. For example, primatologists working with the
goal of studying social structures in the field often impose their own
social structures by turning their assumptions of male dominance into
"observations." Feminist scientists attempt to revise such narratives
by emphasizing organization and cooperation among primate communities:
"revisionists have stressed matrifocal groups, long-term social
cooperation rather than short-term spectacular aggression, flexible
process rather than strict structure” (19). Pointing out that, “Women
know very well that knowledge from the natural sciences has been used
in the interests of our domination and not our liberation," Harwaway
asserts that such revision is about empowering the subjugated,
reconceiving “female receptivity” as "female choice" (8). The creation
of a subject/object split <i>reproduces</i> and legitimizes hierarchies of
domination.

<p>
Not only does paranoid inquiry tend to replicate the assumptions of
the observer, but it blocks out other forms of knowledge. This is
especially evident in the work of historical recovery, in the impulse
to find "hidden" or "forgotten" meaning in textual and archival
material. Recovery works by a self-legitimizing and perpetuating logic
that attempts to render what has been left out, disregarded, or
misunderstood within the logic of dominance. It is Jacques Derrida's
<i>archive fever</i>, or the desire for legibility, under the auspices of
the ruler, which animates the endless search for origins. It is, in
Haraway's words, a search for the "one code that translates all
meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism" (<i>Simians,
Cyborgs, and Women</i> 176).
</p>

<p>
The stakes of recovery work are uniquely stark in the history of the
Black Atlantic, where researchers must work to square the growth of an
inhuman practice within a historical narrative of progress and
liberalization. A tradition that rationalizes slavery with the right
to property, that justifies war through the social contract. Black
Atlantic scholars Lisa Lowe and Saidiya Hartman point out that the
central paradox of studying the archive of slavery is the structuring
condition of recovery. In her essay "History Hesitant," Lowe explains
that because recovery work necessarily occurs within the limits of the
authorizing power, it always subjects itself to that power. Rather
that work under these conditions, historians of enslaved experience
ought to examine this confining structure, "the archeology of
knowledge through which the archive subjects and governs precisely by
means of instruments that absent the humanity of the enslaved”
(87). Researchers might examine, for example, how "the slave trader’s
desire to record, measure, list, and account" weigh up against
"rationalist claims to produce truth or meaning about the terrors of
captivity, enslavement, or torture" (88). Saidiya Hartman similarly
turns to the question of epistemology as the crux of the recovery
work: “If it is no longer sufficient to expose the scandal, then how
might it be possible to generate a different set of descriptions from
this archive?" (7).
</p>

<p>
Oftentimes, new tools can obscure the ways that we replicate our own
assumptions. The advent of photography in the mid-nineteenth century
allowed subjects to codify their prejudices as science, for example,
in the pictures of American slaves taken by Louis Agassiz
in 1850. These daguerrotypes, a pioneering practice in photography
that uses light-sensitive chemicals on silver plates, show how the
impulse for scientific classification impacts the quality and kind of
knowledge that results. Agassiz, a Swiss anthropologist, came to the
United States to study the physical differences between European
whites and African blacks, by examining the shape and character of
their heads and torsos, similar to contemporary studies in physionomy
and phrenology that analyzed the exterior form of the human
body. Agassiz's goal was to amass evidence to support his theory, that
mankind had been separately created and whites and blacks were in fact
different species (Wallis 40). Using photography for anthropoligical
purposes, and organizing photographs to support a classification
system, Agassiz's work demonstrates how the apparent "objectivity" of
the photograph can mask the highly subjective motives for
classification. Writing about the photographs, which were exhibited by
the Amon Carter Museum in 1992, Brian Wallis explains that such images
were organized to suggest divisions between "self and other, healthy
and diseased, normal and pathological," with the insidious effect of
"mask[ing] its subjective distortions in the guise of logic and
organization" (Wallis 47, 54-55). The problem, Wallis points out, is
the realism of the photographic tool obscures the ways that subjects
harness it to solidify their preconceptions&#x2014;"Strengthened by the
seeming transparency of photographic realism, these categories and the
divisions between them soon took on the authority of natural 'facts.'
Supplying either too much or too little information, photographs soon
muddied the easy distinctions between subjective knowledge and what
was called "objective." (47-48). The more seeminly transparent the
tool, the easier it is to wrangle it toward proving "self-evident"
truths.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the apparent fidelity of the photographic tool to record
"nature" in fact obscures the ways that using the tool only reinforces
a preconceived notion of "nature." Wallis explains that, "Supplying
either too much or too little information, photographs soon muddied
the easy distinctions between subjective knowledge and what was called
'objective' (48). The photographs reinforce the ways that scientific
tools, which appear to capture "reality," can be harnessed and
manipulated toward the observer's purpose.
</p>

<p>
Hartman's central problem is what to do with an absent archive. She
leaves us the paradox of recovery work: "How does one revisit the
scene of subjection without replicating the grammar of violence?"
(4). Hartman writes caustically about the impossibility of telling
stories that have been left out of the record. Not only that we can
never recover these stories (they are lost to time) but we can not
approximate them with our current tools, with language. In "Venus in
Two Acts," Hartman tells the story of Black Venus, the unnamed slave
woman who appears variously throughout the "offical" record:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
we could have as easily encountered her in a ship’s ledger in the
tally of debits; or in an overseer’s journal—&#x2013;“last night I laid with
Dido on the ground”; or as an amorous bed-fellow with a purse so
elastic “that it will contain the largest thing any gentleman can
present her with” in Harris’s List of Covent- Garden Ladies; or as the
paramour in the narrative of a mercenary soldier in Surinam; or as a
brothel owner in a traveler’s account of the prostitutes of Barbados;
or as a minor character in a nineteenth-century pornographic novel. 1
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[TODO a better close reading of the above block quote, what are the
figures here?]  
</p>

<p>
What draws all these iterations of Venus together is their silence,
"no one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or
observed that she refused to say anything at all" (2). The fact of
silence cuts deeper than the failure of history but is part of the
condition known as the "violence of the archive," which denotes not
only absence as a form of evidence, in that the physical records are
missing, but also in the tools of expression, in language that cannot
approximate the reality of experience, and in the audible discourse
that dictates silence.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-7-1">
<p>
The reality is that we are stuck in these bodies of our thinking. Rita
Felski describes how seemingly neutral and detatched critical stance
belies an emotional disposition:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Scholars like to think that their claims stand or fall on the merits
of their reasoning and the irresistible weight of their evidence, yet
they also adopt a low-key affective tone that can bolster or
drastically diminish their allure. Critical detachment, in this light,
is not an absence of mood but one manifestation of it&#x2014;a certain
orientation toward one's subject, a way of making one's argument
matter. 6
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The "low-key affective tone" of scholarly discourse suggests that
affect, and the feeling subject associated with it, has been left out
of the critical process. However, appealing to the apparently
unemotional does not succeed in removing emotion from argument&#x2014;this
is impossible&#x2014;but it does reinforce the illusion that emotions don't
belong in rational thought. Actually they do&#x2014;though the emotions of
critical discourse are of a quality and degree that mask their own
presence. Felski explains that, “Rather than an ascetic exercise in
demystification, suspicious reading turns out to be a style of thought
infused with a range of passions and pleasures, intense engagements
and eager commitments” (9). One follows the exposition of the framing
paradigms, the twists and turns of the driving question, the climax of
of discovery followed by the of denouement of the conclusion, one
immediately senses the full dramatic repertoire of critical
inquiry.

<li><a id="orgb7fb7b6"></a>Felski &amp; Sedgwick affective approaches<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-7-2">
<p>
Critics like Rita Felski and Eve Sedgwick adopt an alternative
approach toward reading that exposes knowledge as derived from
embodied experience. Felski talks about reading as an affective
orientation, where readers position themselves and their desires
around texts. Felski critiques the popular orientation in literary
criticism centered on what Paul Riceour has called the “hermeneutics
of suspicion”&#x2014;the desire to unmask and demystify the secrets of
literary works. According to Felski, critics generally behave as if
language is always withholding some truth, that the critic’s task is
to reveal the unsaid or repressed. She identifies the affective modes
of suspicion to include disenchantment, vigilance, paranoia. 
</p>

<p>
Sedgwick makes a similar assertion about tendencies of "paranoid
reading," though she bases her critique on Michele Foucault's
repressive hypothesis from his <i>History of Sexuality, Vol. 1</i>, which
approaches discussions on sex and sexuality through the lense of
repression or prohibition. Rather than excavating the workings of the
repressive hypothesis, Foucault is interested in the ways that
discourse on sex has proliferated, in its multiplications that avoid
censure while satisfying the desire for sexual discourse. Left with no
place to go, discussion on sex simply continued to spread by
transforming itself into palatable discourses such as Marxism,
pyschoanalytic, libertarian, etc. By looking for the specter of
sex/power dynamics in these discourses, Foucault seems to work outside
the logic of the repressive hypothesis. But this is not the
case. Sedgwick explains that, "the almost delirious promise of the
book" is "the suggestion that there might be ways of thinking around
[the repressive hypothesis]" (9). In fact, Sedgwick explains that
Foucault's inquiry has been, from the start, structured by repression
and prohibition. She finds that the "critical analysis of repression
is itself inseparable from repression" (10). 
</p>

<p>
Felski and Sedgwick see a dead end in militant reading practices. 
</p>

<p>
Felski's nightmare: 
Sedgwick's wish: 
</p>

<p>
"How do we step outside the repressive hypothesis "to forms of thought
that would not be structured by the question of prohibition in the
first place?" (<i>Touching Feeling</i> 11).
</p>

<p>
Speaking on Foucault's repressive hypothesis: "I knew what I wanted
from it: some ways of understanding human desire that might be quite
to the side of prohibition and repression, that might hence be
structured quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory',
inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting down and attacking
prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic guises" (<i>Touching
Feeling</i> 10).
</p>

<p>
Felski shows how this suspicion toward texts forecloses other possible
readings while providing no guarantee of rigorous or radical
thought. Rather than adopt a suspicious attitude, Felski suggests that
literary scholars try “postcritical reading," which looks to what the
text suggests or makes possible. Felski wonders what if we allowed
ourselves to be marked or struck by what we read. Then, rather than
just be a cognitive activity, reading can become an “embodied mode of
attentiveness that involves us in acts of sensing, perceiving,
feeling, registering, and engaging” (176).
</p>

<p>
Reading is about movement 
</p>


<p>
Postcritical Reading &#x2014; "Reading, in this light, is a matter of
attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging links between
things that were previously unconnected”… “Reading, in this sense, is
not just a cognitive activity but an embodied mode of attentiveness
that involves us in acts of sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering,
and engaging” (Felski 176).

  to the ways that shame unlocks creativity and productivity&#x2014;to the
  ways that metaphors are made possible through shame. James’
  “blushing”, “flushing” is linked to a fantasy of the skin being

&#x2013;&gt; Love offers a model of "feeling backward" which is a way for critics
to connect with queer subjects in a way that keeps objects out of the
critic's reach. 
</p>

<p>
Heather Love offers a reading strategy that acknowledges queer
experience, particularly suffering, as unconsoleable. In resisting the
temptations to redeem psychic suffering by queer subjects, Heather
Love offers a strategy called "feeling-backward." This strategy opens
a space for bad feelings without trying to recuscitate, justify, or
transform them. She focuses on feelings such as "nostalgia, regret,
shame, despair, <i>ressentiment</i>, passivity escapism, self-hatred,
withdrawal, bitterness, defeatism, and loneliness," which, according
to Love, are tied to "the historical impossibility of same-sex desire"
(4, emphasis original). She examines the burdened protagonists from
famous modernist texts like Walter Pater's <i>The Renaissance: Studies
in Art and Poetry</i> (1873), Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>
(1928), Willa Cather's <i>My Ántonia</i> (1918), and Sylvia Townsend
Warner's <i>Summer Will Show</i> (1936). Love argues that the shame and
stigma experienced by these characters ought to be recognized rather
than resolved. Instead of turning negative histories into sites of
resistance or affirmation, these hurting characters might have full
reign over their own darkness. And this darkness must be where the
critic will meet them.
</p>

<p>
Love proposes a method in which the goal is not to redeem queer
subjects or resolve queer failure. Rather, the problem of
identification is turned to a reading strategy: "I want to suggest a
mode of historiography that recognizes the inevitability of a 'play of
recogniztions,' but that also sees these recognitions not as consoling
but as shattering" (45). Reading, for Love, can enact a "play of
recognitions," which is a way of making fleeting connections that do
not presume complete understanding. It is a way of identifying, but
not fully. Full identification would attempt to wrench the subject
from its suffering, and effectively transform it into something
else. Rather that attempt to rescusitate it, Love looks to the ways
that identity unsettles and dissolves subjectivity. She gives the
example of Stephen Gordon from Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of
Loneliness</i>. Once considered too depressing as a model of lesbianism,
recent critics have cast Stephen Gordon as a transgender figure. Love
resists this label, maintaining that Stephen is “beyond the reach of
such redemptive narratives” (119). The question, for Love, is not
whether Stephen is a pre-op FTM (Female-to-Male), but how Stephen’s
existential negativity can be read as an embodied phenonmenon, as “a
social experience insistently internalized and corporeal” (108).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-9-1">
<p>
The more hopeless and resistant queer subjects make for more tempting
identifications. Love explains how these subjects remain beyond the
reader's grasp: "As queer readers we tend to see ourselves as reaching
back toward isolated figures in the queer past in order to rescue or
save them. It is hard to know what to do with texts that resist our
advances" (8). The reason that these subjects remain so unreachable
has to do with the nature of queerness itself, which represents
absence, loss, and failure. Love illustrates this quality by evoking a
Greek myth, Orpheus and Eurydice, in which the lover botches his
beloved's rescue by looking back at her as they exit the
underworld. Love quotes from Maurice Blanchot's account of the story
in "The Gaze of Orpheus," to describe what Orpheus searches for in the
prohibited and doomed glance backward:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Not to look would be infidelity to the measureless, imprudent force
of his movement, which does not want Eurydice in her daytime truth and
in her everyday appeal, but wants her in her nocturnal obscurity, in
her distance, with her closed body and sealed face&#x2014;wants to see her
not when she is visible, but when she is invisible, and not as the
intimacy of familiar life, but as the foreignness of what excludes all
intimacy, and wants, not to make her live, but to have living in her
the plenditude of death. 50
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Orpheus's downfall is his desire for a glimpse at what cannot be
grapsed, at what remains beyond the light. This desire is not for
"daytime truth" but for "noctural obscurity," which is always receding
at the moment of pursuit. Like Eurydice, queerness emerges only to
slip away, turning its face from the parched gaze. Can we be blamed
for looking for that which cannot be grasped? No, because queerness
has always been structured by that which is not, by what Love calls
"impossible love" (24). Not only is queerness projected to fail, it is
a project of failure. Love reminds us that "Queer history has been an
education in absence" (50). In learning failure and loss, queer
readers can only identify with what they have been taught to recognize
as untouchable. Full identification, like Eurydice in the daylight, is
prevented by design.

We might explore, with Sedgwick, "forms of thought that would not be
structured by the question of prohibition" (11). Sedgwick points that
that critical inquiry might work within a <i>reparative</i> methodology,
which opens room for interpretive possibilities and attention to
positive affects like love, gratitude, and affection. This method
welcomes surprise of discovery over affirmation. It prioritizes "local
theories and nonce taxonomies" over totalizing perspectives (145). We
might approach criticism as having to do with <i>movement</i> rather than
<i>knowledge</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[M]oving from the rather fixated question Is a particular piece of
knowledge true, and how can we know? to further questions: What does
knowledge <i>do</i>&#x2014;the pursuit of it, the having and exposing of it, the
receiving again of knowledge of what one already knows? How, in short,
is knowledge <i>performative</i>, and how best does one move among its
causes and effects?" (my italics, 124)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This reorienation of knowledge as <i>active</i>, as performative, opens up
the critical process to one that is mobile and and speculative rather
than suspicious. Moreover, it draws attention to the ways that
knowledge is embodied, with all the surprises and discoveries that
embodiment entails.

<p>
The narration works as a seduction by piquing the reader's interest in
the story, propelling her through hyperlinks across the various nodes,
and repeatedly frustrating her desire for closure or resolution.
</p>


<p>
The reader’s experience of frustration and desire in navigating
through the story mirrors the themes of sexual frustration and desire
within the story. The electronic format of the story is what allows
this theme to surface, for me. As I follow this disorienting
narrative, I similarly enter into cycles of desire and
frustration. This affective reaction is only possible through a
displacement&#x2014;a formal displacement that uses electronic media to
re-organize, re-structure and display the story in the way we
encounter it.
</p>

<p>
Larry McCaffery, the fiction judge who awarded Fisher the ELO prize,
praises the hyperfiction’s use of fragmentation to present anecdotes,
bits of story and meditations in a way that liberates the story’s
potential: "Fisher creates an interconnected web of branching,
narrative possibilities" (“Comments”). Rather than feel paralyzed by
the variety of options, McCafferty regards such options as liberating
the traditionally pre-determined text into something more malleable,
and therefore, more relatable, to the reader. Jessica Laccetti also
lauds Waves’ indeterminate reading experience, saying that it cannot
have defined beginnings, section divisions, or endings. Each time the
reader sits down and opens this hypertext, it is different; depending
on the chosen order of node, the reader will derive new meaning from
that reading. She argues that, “as the narrative sequencing changes,
so does our understanding of reading” (180). By constantly rearranging
the order of its nodes, hyperfictions like Waves creates new, unique
narratives, “enabl[ing] numerous possibilities for beginnings and,
therefore, sequentialities” (Laccetti 180).
</p>

<p>
Roland Barthes offers a theory about the reader’s affective response
to the text that illuminates how hypertext may use linking as a
narrative strategy to engage, rather than dissuade, the reader. In The
Pleasure of the Text, Barthes describes two ways that texts provoke
reactions by appealing to the reader’s “readerly” or “writerly”
faculties. The text may stimulate pleasure or bliss in the reader
depending on the degree to which its language disrupts his reading
experience. On the one hand, the text of pleasure, or the “readerly”
text, is “the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the text
that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a
comfortable practice of reading” (all italics original; 14).  The text
of bliss, the “writerly” text, on the other hand, is one “that imposes
a state of loss, the text that discomforts (perhaps to the point of a
certain boredom), unsettles the reader’s historical, cultural,
psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values,
memories, brings to a crisis his relation with language” (14). The
important difference here is the extent to which the text stimulates
affects that actively push the reader away or disrupt his reading. The
text of pleasure operates according to the principles of narrative
suspense that drive traditional stories, like cause and effect, while
the text of bliss negates these principles: “what pleasure wants is
the site of loss, the seam, the cut, the deflation, the dissolve which
seizes the subject in the midst of bliss” (Barthes 7). In other words,
the text of bliss is an interruption of the comfortable reading
experience that emphasizes the reader’s position as a
subject. According to Barthes, the text of bliss is a positive
experience for the reader insofar as he enjoys this interruption: “the
subject gains access to bliss by the cohabitation of languages working
side by side: the text… is a sanctioned babel” (4). Barthes
description here applies nicely to the structure of hypertext fiction,
in which different texts are embedded quite literally side by side in
the form of hyperlinks: insofar as the reader “sanctions” these texts,
he will experience them as texts of bliss.
</p>

<p>
 From its table of contents, the novella foregrounds the reader’s
agency in navigating through its fragmentary structure, where the
reader encounters a navigation page that lists eight main sections, or
chapters, of the narrative. These sections are named “kissing girls,”
“school tales,” “I want her,” “city,” “country,” “she was warned,”
“dare,” and “her collections.” When the reader pans over each chapter
title, a textual blurb appears containing an excerpt from that
chapter, which often draw from a sexual episode that stimulate
reader's interest in that chapter, enticing her onward. For example,
the excerpt for “I want her” presents an erotic moment between the
narrator and one of her lovers, Jennie.:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’m in bed with Jennie Winchester and I realize she want me to undo
her pants. She needs to be home by 11:00 and needs to leave my place
by 10:45. I’m kissing her but opening my eyes at intervals to catch
the clock. At exactly 10:43 I unbutton her Levis and shove my hand
inside, barely undoing the zipper. “I’m in bed&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The narrator severs the excerpt at a moment of climax, tempting the
reader to click through to the next node. Another section heading,
“dare,” displays a similar strategy: “Fay Devlin and I are playing
spin the bottle. She spins, but she trembles. By the time we get to
Truth or Dare, I have my lips on her nipple and I’ve made her do the
asking” (“These Waves of Girls…”). These excerpts establish the
reader’s agency and the novel’s fragmentary structure from the outset
of the novella. Because the chapters are unnumbered, the reader must
determine how to proceed through the sections of the novella by making
decisions about which to read first. These previews function to entice
the reader to click through to read the rest of that section. And
while the table of contents hints at the existence of an underlying
structure to the narrative, that structure also reveals itself to be
founded on fragments. In this way, the reader’s first encounter with
the text portends that she may never get the whole story, yet
encourages her onward.
</p>

<p>
In fact, as this semblance of narrative organization all but
disappears beyond the table of contents, it becomes increasingly clear
that the reader fully controls the order of nodes. After progressing
from the navigation page, the reader’s options multiply exponentially,
and these options compete for the reader’s selection. In order to
proceed through the text, the reader is forced to decide from the
abundance of choices. On this particular node, reached from the “I
want her” chapter title on the table of contents, hyperlinks run up
and down the left side of the screen and populate the main
text. Clicking through the first link in the main text, “Jennie,” the
reader reaches a node with nine links. Again, how does she choose to
proceed among these links? According to Barthes, the text of bliss
wants to be read: “the text you write must prove to me that it desires
me” (6). In deciding between the links that vie for her attention, the
reader may follow her own impulsivity (she may simply click on the
first link she sees, as she did on the previous page) or her interest
in the word being linked. The node tells a story about Jennie and
Tracey engaging in adolescent sexual exploits at summer camp. The
links on this page include “been to that campground,” “It's grade 10,”
“in my head I imagine a desperate love triangle,” “her hand under my
shirt,” “the s l o w movements of Jennie's fingers,” “a dyke &#x2013; I know
it &#x2013; but she won't do anything about it &#x2013; can't &#x2013; frozen,” “Close
the lights,” “We try not to move too much, too loudly,” and “attended
camp” (“Jennie only attended…”). At every node, the text proves again
and again that it desires her. The reader may decide to read through
this page, or read only a portion of the page, and interrupt her
progress to click on a link. Or the reader may forgo reading this page
altogether, and follow another link to a wholly new page. Either way,
she makes a decision in order to proceed, and her decision determines
the order of each node’s appearance. The text of bliss wants to be
read, and the reader must decide how. By assembling the node into a
specific order, the reader organizes the text of bliss according to
the unique path that she chooses.

“objective” image" (par. 2)</li>

the pleasures of opacity" (par. 2)</li>
<li>"Shine also complicates matters because of the way that it is
imbricated in representations of blackness&#x2026;Shine distracts from

Missing pages &#x2014; the marbled page substitutes speculation for recovery which the corporation wants (to monetize the image of “abnormal” genitalia). But the narrator didn’t want to include it. The absence of the picture doesn’t point to a physical absence, but to the inability to articulate exactly what was there according to the structures of the time.
</p>

<p>
This is like Klein's image of absence and Caughie's storm cloud, a refusal to engage with positivist impulse, but here it's taken to apply to alternative sexual identities. Some things, if already absent, are not meant to be “recovered”. They can just exist as an absence.
</p>

<p>
There are stakes in here about archival work and knowledge and what can and cannot be said. There is a massive gap in our understanding of transbodies and sex and it cannot be articulated or understood so it simply comes across as absent. The missing page creates an economy of speculation.

As disidentified, queer subjects remain outside of the confines of the
visible. To gain visibility within the dominant system only reproduces
visibility within the terms of that system. This position has been
articulated by critiques of feminism since the 70s and 80s, and later
on, in critiques of LGBT+ equality movements. bell hooks explains that
one of the main issues with the women's movement of the 70s and 80s
was a lack of agreement about the goals of feminism. Feminists that
advocate for "equality with men," miss the point of radical change
altogether: "As long as&#x2026; any group defines liberation as gaining
social equality with ruling class white men, they have a vested
interest in the continued exploitation and oppression of others"
(<i>Feminist Theory</i> 15). By prioritizing equal rights, such as access
to employment, childcare, and social services, the women's movement
asks to be included in the existing system that is already oppressing
them. hooks is not saying that these aren't worthy or even necessary
causes, but that the changes enacted by such measures will not be
enough to raise the quality of life for oppressed and exploited
peoples. This in particular is harmful for black women, who, as women
of color, have the most to lose within the neoliberal ideology. hooks
asserts that "Feminism is a struggle to end sexist
oppression. Therefore, it is necessarily a struggle to eradicate the
ideology of domination that permeates Western culture on various
levels as well as a commitment to reorganizing society" (<i>Feminist
Theory</i> 24). One of the major stakes in this chapter is to find ways
of subverting, resisting, or opting out of hegemonic understandings of
visibility as progress. This chapter will explore how being visible,
accessible, <i>touchable</i> by the dominant power is being subjected to
the terms of that power. At that point, it will be clear that
queerness's status as untouchable works to enhance its political
potential.

<p>
Writing the self is connected to form. Always. The form is
multiple. The form makes subjectivity opaque, but in the act of
abstraction, making it opaque, we can touch it and play around with
it. 
</p>

<p>
Opacity as value (Amin, Musser)
</p>

<p>
“For our purposes, queer form means challenging the primacy of the
visual, which has too often been a site for pernicious power
relations… At their base, such operations of surveillance and
classification rely on the concept of immutable difference, on sharp
boundaries, and on the possibility of exhaustively knowing the
other…. We see queer form as an aesthetics that moves persistently
around the visual, thereby avoiding this flattening. To the extent
that form operates behind the scenes as ideological impulse and
materiality, queer formal practices can resist the dictates of
transparency normally required of non-normative subjects by
illuminating the unseen. In this way it not only troubles the
epistemic assurances of the visual regime, but it also asks how
shifting away from static visuality can circumnavigate questions of
objectification. A move toward the diffusely sensual, and away from
the linearity of visual gazing, articulates difference in terms that
are not about dominance or norms, but that underscore the importance
of thinking with other modes of knowing, theorizing, and
experiencing. Queer form is about other ways of understanding
relationships to power and relationships to being” (Amin, Musser,
Perez 232-3)
</p>

<p>
Form understood as associated with queerness, queer experience, and as a way to disrupt easy understanding. Form can be queer and queer form can be opaque: 
“Form informs queerness, and queerness is best understood as a series of relations to form, relations not limited to binary and adversarial models of resistance and opposition” (228).
“Queer form” emerges… as a name for the range of formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies that make difference a little less knowable, visible, and digestible. This special issue makes a case for the value of indirection, opacity, and withholding as queer strategies for minoritarian art producers” (235).
 “form focuses attention on how violence—homophobia, racism, gentrification, capitalism, and colonialism, for instance—has structured conditions of possibility in material and epistemological ways” (232).

<p>
&#x2013;&gt; the challenge is to regain touch without resolving it&#x2013;overcoming
impulse of subj/obj divides. how do we touch without presuming full
connections? the answer is through abstraction, formalization,
opacity&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Touch reconciles the inherent connection between bodies, something
that heteronormativity tries to suppress. For things to not touch, to
be severed or "objectified," moves them into a relation of
violence. Gloria Anzaldua explains that separation is brutal: "In
trying to become 'objective,' Western culture made 'objects' of things
and people when it distanced itself from them, thereby losing 'touch'
with them. This dichotomy is the root of all violence" (37). Losing
touch is a prerequisite for exploitation. The sundering of "objects"
from our touch primes us to take advantage of them. Colonial history
is a case study in losing touch: "White America has only attended to
the body of the earth in order to exploit it, never to succor it or to
be nurtured in it" (68). Anzaldua's <i>mestiza</i>, birthed in the open
wound of the border, "where the Third World grates against the first
and bleeds," is an attempt to bring together what has been separated
(3). Those who live on the border know better than anyone&#x2013;divisions
between bodies puts those bodies into conflict.
</p>

<p>
Touch offers myriad ways of relation. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick offers
touch as a way of connecting to objects that evades "dualistic
thought," that is, in "binary" thought, where things are presumed to
be discrete and opposed. 
</p>

<p>
"But it is not enough to stand on the opposite river bank, shouting
questions,. challenging patriarchal, white conventions.  A
counterstance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked
in mortal ,combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to
a common denominator of violence&#x2026; At some point, on our way to a new
consciousness, we will have to leave the opposite bank, the split
between the two mortal combatants somehow healed so that we are on
both shores at once and, at once, see through serpent and eagle eyes"
(Anzaldúa 78-79 in old book).
</p>

<p>
Confronting the incommensurable requires subjects to step temporarily
into the place of the other, "that person or experience which makes it
possible for the self to recognize its own limited horizons in the
light of asymmetrically given relations marked by sexual, social,
cultural, or other differences" (Schutte 54).
</p>

<p>
This physical upheaval is the ground from which the mestiza builds
identity: "The new mestiza copes by developing a tolerance for
contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity. She learns to be an Indian
in Mexican culture, to be Mexican from an Anglo point of view. She
learns to juggle cultures" (79).
</p>

<p>
As Cherríe Moraga points out, "it is not really difference the
oppressor fears so much as similarity" (La Guera, 30). Although the
feeling of incommensurability is central to queer experience, it can
be accessible to majority groups. Getting in touch with the <i>choque</i>,
however, is a great challenge for minority subjects, and an even
greater challenge for those of dominant cultures. For those who can
avoid it, there is an aversion to confront the "stranger within."
</p>

<p>
In short, for queer bodies, there is a dual impulse, a desire to touch
and be touched that coexists with the inability for touch to satisfy,
provide redemption, or avoid violation. Respecting the right not to be
touched, some queer theorists pursue critical methods that prevent
overidentification or overanalysis. They resist reading practices,
which have been called "suspicious reading" or "paranoid
reading"<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>, that seek to expose the effects of homophobic
prohibition and repression with the goal of affirming queer subjects
or recuperating their losses. Paranoid or suspicious reading is
oriented around finding and exposing the pain and shame of the closet
in order to turn them into sites of political resistance, liberation,
or pride.
</p>

<p>
This leads us to the main problem with touch: it goes both ways. What
I touch also touches me; one body impressed by or in collision with
another. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick explains that "the sense of touch makes
nonsense out of any dualistic understanding of agency and passivity;
to touch is always already to reach out, to fondle, to heft, to tap,
or to enfold" (13). Touch engages a range of relations where power is
not always reduced to opposition. The sensation of touch often
obscures this dual effect. Some bodies appear to desire touching
rather than being touched; sometimes, the desire for touch does not
seek contact, but the fullness of desiring.  it is bidirectional,
reveals a subject/object divide.

In looking at this book that I’m almost finished writing, I see a
mosaic pattern (Aztec-like) emerging, a weaving pattern, thin here,
thick there. I see a preoccupation with the deep structure, the
underlying structure, with the gesso underpainting that is red earth,
black earth. I can see the deep structure, the scaffolding. If I can
get the bone structure right, then putting flesh on it proceeds
without too many hitches. The problem is that the bones often do not
exist prior to the flesh, but are shaped after a vague and broad
shadow of its form is discerned or uncovered during beginning, middle
and final stages of the writing. Numerous overlays of paint, rough
surfaces, smooth surfaces make me realize l am preoccupied with
texture as well. Too, I see the barely contained color threatening to
spill over the boundaries of the object it represents and into other
"objects" and over the borders of the frame. I see a hybridization of
metaphor, different species of ideas popping up here, popping up
there, full of variations and seeming contradictions, though I believe
in an ordered, structured universe where all phenomena are
interrelated and imbued with spirit. This almost finished product
seems an assemblage, a montage, a beaded work with several leitmotifs
and with a central core, now appearing, now disappearing in a crazy
dance. The whole thing has had a mind of its own, escaping me and
insisting on putting together the pieces of its own puzzle with
minimal direction hom my will. It is a rebellious, willful entity, a
precocious girl-child forced to grow up too quickly, rough,
unyielding, with pieces of feather sticking out here and there, fur,
twigs, clay. My child, but not for much longer. This female being is
angry, sad, joyful, is Coatlicue, dove, horse, serpent, cactus. Though
it is a flawed thing&#x2014;a clumsy, complex, groping blind thing&#x2014;for me
it is alive, infused with spirit. I talk to it; it talks to me. (66-67

Before I turn to current examples of distant reading, it is useful to
contextualize the technological development of digital tools in the
latter 20th century. This contextualization reveals how the intentions
guiding technological development contradicts common understandings
about new information technology being progressive, democratic, or
"free". In fact, many of these tools were created with conservative
intentions and perpetuate cultural assumptions that elide complexity
and difference. In what follows, I will briefly trace the development
of networking and software technologies from the 1960s through the end
of the 20th century, then turn to the "surveillance" technology of the
last two decades, highlighting how more recent technology maintains
some of the crucial assumptions from the last century. This
contextulization, however brief, will help to situate the ways that
digital humanists today approach the use of digital tools in their
research methodologies.
</p>

<p>
First, the development of the internet, which is a global network of
interconnected computers, is often credited for "democratizing" access
to information. Early networks like Usenet, developed in 1979,
popularized online message boards, file-sharing, and eventually
e-mail. Built from ideals of open exchange and user agency in "an
effort to break down modes of exclusion," the network was developed by
people who wanted to communicate horizontally, practice improvisation
and "hacking." (Rosenweig, "Wizards, Bureaucrats&#x2026;, 1549). Moving to
1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), proposed the development of
a distributed information system that would eventually become the
World Wide Web.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> While working at CERN, Berners-Lee identified
personnel access to the latest information across the center as a
major problem for the organization’s workflow, lamenting that
“Information is constantly being lost… often, the information has been
recorded, it just cannot be found." Berners Lee saw information and
people, the connection between human bodies with bodies of text, as
the problem. He proposed a new resource for orienting researchers that
was accessible, flexible, and emendable, initiating work on the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that would eventually become
integral to creating the World Wide Web.
</p>

<p>
These positive narratives about Usenet and the World Wide Web dominate
the history of internet. Less acknowledged is how networking
technologies largely support a structure of control over its users. To
begin with, the internet's early development was funded by two
Department of Defense projects, the RAND corporation (then a Cold War
think-tank), and ARPANET (the Advanced Research Projects Agency
Network), which later became the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA). These US military stakeholders wanted to preserve
command and control in the case of a catastrophic nuclear
event,<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup> and reasoned that a distributed network would create
national communication contingency.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup> The RAND Corporation fist
theorized the distributed network, and ARPANET formalized the new
technology of packet switching, which is a method of grouping data
into small packets that can be later reassembled at the final
destination. In order to send information along the network, data has
to be appended with protocols, or codes like HTTP, which impose
structures on data to make connections possible.  As Alexander
Galloway points out, whether users know it or not, they
"accept&#x2026; universal standardization in order to facilitate the freer
and more democratic medium” (147).<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup> The trade-off between access
and standardization, freedom and control, is often invisible to the
end user, who isn't aware of the packets that are constantly passing
through their computer. Wendy Chun uses the image of a window to
illustrate the two way direction of information traffic, how using the
internet is also always being used by it. She warns: “If you believe
that your communications are private, it is because software
corporations, as they relentlessly code and circulate you, tell you
that you are behind, and not in front of, the window” (22).<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Major developments in technology also perpetuate racial
assumptions. Moving from networking technologies to software
development, Tara McPherson explores the parallels between the
Operating Systems and race relations, to show how the development of
computer software betrays hegemonic assumptions about whiteness and
elisions of difference.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> She focuses on the key moment of 1960s
United States, when Operating Systems, which is the foundational
software that supports a computer's programs and basic functioning,
developed alongside civil rights discourses. Her research focuses on
how "the organization of information and capital" in OS development
resonates in the struggles for racial justice: "Many of these shifts
were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
radicalism" (30). McPherson deconstructs the UNIX operating system
which includes a hierarchical file system, a command line interpreter
(the Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), and a variety of
software programs that are designed to work in tandem. McPherson
points out that UNIX-based Operating Systems (like Mac and Linux) are
distinguished by the ways that they partition and simplify complex
processes into discrete components, similar to the ways that identity
politics cordones off parts of the (social and technological) system
into distinct units. While this cordoning was productive for the
promotion of civil rights, it also, according to McPherson, "curtailed
and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing
struggle to fairly discrete parameters" (30).
</p>

<p>
Crystallizing the intersection between Operating Systems and race
relations, McPherson asserts that "Certain modes of racial visibility
and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing
data" (24). McPherson emphasizes the "rules" of UNIX philosophy, which
lay out how UNIX's development prioritized the organization and
simplification of data processing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear
by demonstration that nothing else will do. Rule of Transparency:
Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier&#x2026; Rule
of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be
stupid and robust. 26
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions. The rule of "Transparency" flattens
nuance and ambiguity, making program components as legible as
possible. The rule of "Representation," particularly the suggestion to
"Fold knowledge into data" reduces the complexity of raw data, so that
it can be easily input into multiple processes. According to
McPherson, all of these rules work together to shore up the central
design theory of "modularity,"<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup> which stipulates that components
are self-contained and interoperable, so they can be independently
created, modified, and replaced without affecting the whole system.
</p>

<p>
The role of control in creating the internet and the emphasis on data
reduction in developing operating stystems leave their legacies on
21st century digital technology, where race becomes collapsed into
data. Echoing McPherson, Ruha Benjamin asserts that technology
reproduces social inequities under the guise of objectivity and
progressivism.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup> Turning to technology, Benjamin explores how
innovations in Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic computing
extend racist paradigms into ever new tools, particularly in data
gathering and surveillance. The creators of these new technologies
mark, track, and quantify blackness, for example, in databases for
healthcare or financial services that associate "black names" with
criminality (Benjamin 5). With each update, technology is continually
promoted as efficient and progressive in a way that masks how it
exploits data about its subjects. Benjamin explains, "we are told that
how tech sees “difference” is a more objective reflection of reality
than if a mere human produced the same results&#x2026; bias enters through
the backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6). As she points out, "the road
to inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7). Like the creators of
UNIX, the creators of such tools and algorithms operate under
assumptions of white universality that inevitably marks blackness as
"other."

<p>
Let us now turn to computational methods, seeing how they bear out
some of the legacies from the above technological
histories. Practitioners of "distant reading," a critical method at
the intersection of Literary Studies and Data Science, use
quantitative analysis to study works of literature. This process
involves deploying computer programs to clean, categorize, and count
elements in textual data, and is often followed by interpretive
analysis, where the critic engages the results of quantification from
a humanities lense. More often than not, distant reading is combined
with close reading methods, as crtics will use the results of
quantitative analysis to identify key moments from the text that merit
closer attention.<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
According to its practitioners, distant reading is most useful for the
ways it allows connections to emerge among vast amounts of textual
data. Critics who do this work often emphasize the problem of literary
scale and human attention, because distant reading allows them to
handle the thousands of books in literary history without actually
reading these texts. One prominent practitioner of Computational
Literary Studies (CLS), Ted Underwood,<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup> harnesses the power of
quantification and machine learning to glimpse what he calls the
"distant horizon" of literary trends across centuries. His argument
convincingly begins with the observation that human capacities of
sight, attention, and memory preclude them from grasping the larger
patterns of literary history across time. Distant reading, where
"distance" means abstraction, or the simplification of textual data
into computable objects such as publication dates and genres, allows
critics to see connections amid the swarm of overflowing information.
</p>

<p>
Among distant reading practitioners, Underwood's approach is unique in
that he models the ways that human assumptions can affect the results
of analysis. Underwood is careful to point out the subjective nature
of his method, which he calls "perspectival modelling," by turning it
into an object of study. He uses machine learning, or programs
"trained" by certain data sets, to create models that can then make
predictions on other datasets. He explains that, "Since learning
algorithms rely on examples rather than fixed definitions, they can be
used to model the tacit assumptions shared by particular communities
of production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
93). One of his projects examines gender roles in novels from the
18th century to the 21st century by using a machine-learning model to
"guess" the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated
with that character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on&#x2013;excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like <i>boyhood</i> or <i>wife</i>. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. <i>Distant Horizons</i> 115
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In simplest terms, the program studies some given adjectives
associated with a male or female character in order to make
predictions about other characters' genders. Inevitably, the resulting
output is always determined by this initial input. Underwood carefully
asserts that these models reveal, not the truth of literary histroy,
but the approaches and choices made by those who create the models:
"Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and
rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence
used to train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
92). This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles
in novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 114). The graph shows a steady
overlapping of words traditionally associated with women, such as
"heart," with words typically assoicated with men, like "passion,"
toward the middle of the 20th century. One of the many explanations
for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice of writing
became more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the middle of the
20th century than it was previously (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 137). This
fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about men than
women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline in
female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly paradoxical conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while the actual prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be possible.
</p>

<p>
However, the results of Underwood's "perspectival modeling" can only
be as good as the questions he asks. From a critical gender
perspective, Underwood's approach imposes the very structure that he
is attempting to deconstruct. In other project, he where he similarly
measures the "transformations" of gender across time periods, he
explains that simplification is necessary ("Machine Learnig and Human
Perspective" 93):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Underwood admits that he needs a "simple" model in order to bring into
relation the dynamics of gender (See Fig. 2).<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup> However, he
underestimates the extent to which his initial assumptions determine
the final result. Although he considers the possibility that he finds
a structural tension between gender "because [he] explores gender, for
the most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant Horizons 140), he
neglects to consider how the collapsing of gender into a single graph
perpetuates the structural categories of male/female in a way that is
neglects the assumptions behind such a category.<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup> Moreover, the
issue is not just with the assumptions at the outset which reproduces
the result, but with the guiding question of the entire project, which
is not about deconstructing gender, but about reifying it. To begin
with, why should humanists seek to automate the conscription of gender
norms within these terms? Asking a machine to replicate the
conscription of gender for the purpose of seeing how male and female
roles in novels change over time only creates a model of gender that
is "simple" enough to be computed by the system. How does simplifying
the concept of gender contribute to our study of it? The results of
using the machine can only be as good as the questions we ask.

<p>
Critiquing scholars like Underwood, Nan Z. Da argues that quantitative
methods are ill-suited for literary criticism. She accusses Underwood
and other distant reading practitioners for trading "speed for
accuracy, and coverage for nuance" (620). Of her many gripes with
quantitative methods, which include "technical problems, logical
fallacies," and a "fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical tools
that are used and the objects to which they are applied" (601), she
emphasizes the lack of reproducible results, the idea that one
researcher's process can be reproduced by another with identical
output, which is essential to statistical methodologies. She
demonstrates with an experiment of Topic Modelling, which is the
processing of large texts in order to generate a number of "topics"
within the corpus. Researchers often use Topic Modelling as a way of
speed-reading a massive corpus to get a sense of what it is about
without having to actually look at the text. Da attempts to verify the
results of a Topic Modelling experiment by replicating the process on
her own machine, a replication that fails. She concludes that, "if the
method were effective, someone with comparable training should be able
to use the same parameters to get basically the same results"
(628-629).<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21">21</a></sup> For Da, reproducibility of method is a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of quantification.
</p>

<p>
Despite their vastly different committments, scholars like Underwood
align with Da on the value that they place on reproducibility, which
is an ultimately conservative investment. Underwood demonstrates how
the critic reproduces their assumptions in the questions and data used
at the outset in a way that structures the final result. Da's emphasis
on the reproducible suggests that, to be useful, quantitative literary
criticism ought to resemble something more like statistical analysis:
if the method can be verified, can be copied and reproduced, then the
interpretive conditions might be universalized.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-3">
<p>
Underwood and Da overlook the way that quantification can be used to
disrupt assumptions or reveal the constructed nature of data. In
contrast to Underwood and Da, Johanna Drucker is careful to dispell
the illusion of "raw data," which comes already reduced to fit
whatever parameters required by analysis. Because data always
undergoes a transformation in order to be quantified, its complexity
is always reduced. As a result, Drucker argues, quantification
techniques such as visualizations in graphs and charts inevitably
misrepresent the data they are meant to convey. To illustrate this
process, Drucker presents a chart displaying the amount of books
published over several years. The chart appears to convey production
during this specific time period, but Drucker explains that
publication date is an arbitrary metric for capturing
production.<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22">22</a></sup> She brings to the surface all the assumptions made
in such a metric, for example, the limitations of "novel" as a genre
and the connotations behind "published," which suggests date of
appearance, but has no indication of composition, editing, review,
distribution. Each piece of data carries with it the result of many
interpretive decisions, that carry with them varying degrees of
opacity, which are all necessary in order to present complex concepts
like book production as a bar on a chart. Drucker explains: "the
graphical presentation of supposedly self-evident
information&#x2026; conceals these complexities, and the interpretative
factors that bring the numerics into being, under a guise of graphical
legibility" (Drucker par. 23).
</p>

<p>
To resist the reductions of "data," a term that deceptively connotes
that which is "given," Drucker proposes thinking of data as "capta,"
which suggests that which is taken. Drucker's "capta" is deliberately
creative, turning graphical expressions into expressive metrics:
components used for measurement, like lines or bars on a graph, break,
blur, or bleed into one another. Objects are not discrete entities,
but interact with the other objects in the visualization. For example,
in a bar graph of book publications by year, she warps the graphical
metrics, making some of them fuzzy, wider, shorter, in an attempt to
show that publication as a metric elides other information such as
composition, editing, purchasing, etc.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/Drucker.png" alt="Drucker.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Emphasizing "capta" is a way of figuring elements that have been
reduced, resolved, or ignored in traditional quantitative
analysis. Drucker makes evident what is overlooked or assumed when
dealing with complex subjects by muddling (rather than simplifying)
the relationship between elements.
</p>

<p>
[The next step, which I want to take here, is to show how paying
attention to the assumptions (deconstructing) is a return to
embodiment. Allows us back into the concept of touching&#x2013;mirrored in

<p>
In the section on reproducibility, I discuss how Underwood's analysis
on gender differences reproduces his assumptions about gender dynamics
as oppositional, which he readily admits: "this chapter has discovered
stable 'structural positions' only because it explores gender, for the
most part, as a binary opposition" (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 140). The
question then becomes, how can we move beyond reproducing assumptions
in our analysis? The answer is to shift the objective of analysis from
the the reproducible to the alternative. The first value that this
reading method proposes is that of <i>performance</i>. This value points to
the active qualities of critical analysis, emphasizing materiality and
sensitivity, movement and discovery. When reading is performative, the
process is more important than the product. To demonstrate this value
in practice, I turn to the work of Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement,
both of whom have deep investments with traditions of textual
scholarship, particularly the scholarship of Jerome McGann, that has
influenced early experiments with digital humanities in English
departments. Although their approaches vary in their specific topics,
methods, and results, they are connected in an investment for, in the
words of McGann, "imagining what we don't know" (82).

&#x2013;&gt; bode emphasizes how inquiry implicates the researcher, who
generates at the same time that she analyzes data. Instead of looking
at what is being reproduced, look at how human engagement has
entangled with and created the object of analysis.
</p>

<p>
Katherine Bode offers a method that builds off the humanistic
approaches in textual scholarship and bibliography. Her work explores
the boundary between the humanities and social sciences in order to
reframe analysis as performative. Bode argues against the trend of
representationalism, "the idea that a knowing human agent symbolically
expresses – or represents – some thing-in-the-world (that thing is
unchanged by that expression, and that expression is more available or
apprehensible to the subject than the thing itself)&#x2013;in digital
literary studies ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 2). Pushing
against this assumption of representation in computational modelling,
she explains that "entities don’t pre-exist engagements but are
generated in an ongoing or emergent way, by those intra-actions"
("Data Beyond Represenation" par. 2). This is not to say that one can
refrain from implication with the object of study. Rather, a
performative approach assumes such implication to be the starting
point of analysis: "all inquiries create boundaries (or cuts) in a
complex reality that can be organised in other ways; and all such
boundary-making practices are inevitably biased at the same time as
they are a condition of inquiry" (Data Beyond Representation
par. 16). The point, for Bode, is to examine "how&#x2026; we inscribe the
boundaries we often presume to represent" ("Data Beyond Representation
par 11.)
</p>

<p>
Her current project, <i>Reading at the Interface</i>, examines the ways
that Australian literature has been characterized by various
"paratexts," or "writings about literature." The project explores
alternative understandings of Australian literature across various
platforms, including academic journals, newspapers, <i>Goodreads</i>, and
<i>Librarything</i>.
</p>


<p>
"In mining <i>Goodreads</i>, for instance, using a list of works defined by
an academic bibliography, I’m not interested in representing
discussion of “Australian literature” on Goodreads so much as in
materialising that platform in ways that cannot be separated from my
categories of analysis" (Data Beyond Representation par. 19).
</p>





<p>
For Bode, what statisticians value as “representativeness” or
“reproducibility” isn’t as important (within a humanities context) as
the materiality of the apparatus. Rather than attempt to secure a
factual or objective status of the data, we should double down on the
idiosyncracies of our tools. Accordingly, Bode suggests that we
approach literary databases in performative terms, taking a
self-conscious appraisal of the tools of analysis, as "effects of
material-semiotic engagements" ("Data Beyond Representation" 15).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"at present, discussion of “representativeness” and
“reproducibility” are bound up together, with the implication that
if we can represent something accurately enough the results of
analysis will be reproducible. Foregrounding the apparatus, by
contrast, recognises that our knowledge making practices, as Karen
Barad puts it, “contribute to, and are part of, the phenomena we
describe”" (Bode "Data Beyond Representation, par. 26).</li>
</ul>

<p>
"I’m exploring what it might mean to conceive of literary databases as
apparatuses, in the sense the term is used in various scientific
disciplines, particularly physics. There, an apparatus is a specific
material configuration, including of physicists, wherein certain
properties become determinate, while others are excluded. One can’t
measure light as a particle and a wave using the same apparatus; but
that doesn’t mean that light is not one thing when it is measured as
the other. Although it must be said that the phenomena explored in
digital literary studies are much more diverse than those for which
apparatuses in physics are developed, I wonder if shifting to a
conception of measurements as effects of particular material
arrangements might help us to reframe some key debates in our field."
(Bode "Data Beyond Representation, par. 24).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-3">
<p>
Underwood overlooks the ways that quantitative literary analysis, or
distant reading, enables "sensitive" readings of textual
material. According to him, such methods are less useful for studying
a single text in depth and more useful for taking a long view of
larger corpora. He sets up an opposition between computer and human
reading: "Computational analysis of a text is more flexible than it
used to be, but it is still quite crude compared to human reading; it
helps mainly with questions where evidence is simply too big to fit in
a single reader's memory" (xxi). Underwood is right to point out that
a computer cannot draw inferences like a human can. However, his
emphasis on the role of memory opens up the ways that computers can
enhance human reading of smaller texts. What the computer properly
does is arrange a set of data&#x2013;of any size&#x2013;for human
consumption. This involves processing datasets into new formats that
can than be scrutinzed by a human reader. Underwood's goal, which is
"to find a perspective that makes the descriptions preferred by
eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century scholars all congruent
with each other," shows one potential objective for such reading
(<i>Distant Horizons</i> 32). But there is more than one objective for
using quantitative methods regarding memory, and that is by
approaching memory, specifically human attention spans, as a drive,
rather than a hindrance. The computer can arrange text in a way that
harnesses the attention span of the reader.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-5">
<p>
Tanya Clement and Jerome McGann have written on how electronic
environments facilitate active experiences with text. Their analyses
draw attention to the ways that the reading process engages with the
situatedness of time, space, and textual objects that are entangled
within a complicated network of production and reception. Such a
reading process yields unexpected and alternative interpretive
possibilities. Clement's textual scholarship works with sound to
develop an hermeneutics that incorporates praxis, visualization,
embodiment, and play, toward a theory of performantive criticism. She
often questions how working with audio allows us to reconsider the
ways we approach electronic text. In one project, she explores how
visualizations of audio information can influence analysis. She puts
forth a theory of “play” in which the critic "performs" the work, much
like the way that musicians interpret a musical score. Clement makes
the analogy between musical scores and quantitative visualizations to
emphasize how both "create another level of abstraction with which the
interpreter engages" ("Distant Listening par. 7). These visualizations
use the audio analysis tool ProseVis to create dynamic spaces for the
reader to interact with a digitzed object. Using ProseVis, the reader
can navigate through the visualizations and manipulate the metrics for
analysis, in this case, the prosodic elements of Gertrude Stein's
poetry. Clement draws out the comparison between musical scores and
visualizations to emphasize the performative qualities of
analysis. She begins by describing the qualities of a musical score:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[I]t is read, but it is also meant to be played, to be spatialized in
time and embodied by voices (or instruments) within a certain physical
and hermeneutical context. I am arguing the same is true of
computational visualizations of text. One 'reads' a visualization, but
to 'play' the visualisation is to engage the spatialized
interpretation of that visualisation as an embodied reader in a
situated context within a specific hermeneutical framework. "Distant
Listening" par. 10
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like a musical score, which "point[s] toward many possible
interpretive 'results' or readings," visualizaions can provide a
starting ground for different pathways of analysis ("Distant
Listening" par. 12). Clement's scholarship on audio visualization
magnifies the importance of performance as an element in analysis. 
</p>

<p>
McGann's work on textual scholarshop similarly draws attention to the
effect of performance on interpretation, or performance <i>as</i>
interpretation, according to McGann. Along with Lisa Samuels, McGann
coins the concept of "deformance," which describes any activity that
distorts, disorders, or re-assembles literary texts to discover new
insights about its formal significance and meaning. They offer the
example of reading a poem backward, where “the critical and
interpretive question is not 'What does the poem mean?' but 'How do we
release or expose this poem’s possibilities for meaning?'"
(108). Deformance works by estranging the reader from her familiarity
of the text, and relies on the the volitality of meaning of particular
words that depend upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent
readings and pathways through that text, to the significance of
immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces, all of which
the reader can only process a limited amount. Digital tools might work
alongside this volatile potential for meaning, what McGann calls the
text's "quantum poetics." He explains that, “Aesthetic space is
organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements
making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even reverse
themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete quantum
levels” (183). McGann speculates that engaging with texts on a
computer could be as intimate a process as engaging with them on
paper, with the additional ability of manipulating and transforming
them in virtually infinite ways. Ideally, the tool should work as a
“prosthetic extension of that demand for critical reflection,” with
which the reader is able to feel her way through the text (18).
</p>

<p>
Clement and McGann's approaches facilitate a reading method that uses
computational tools in the aid of discovery. Human attention spans,
rather than represent the hurdle for computational methods to
overcome, offer an opportunity for re-imagining analysis as a process
deforming what we pay attention to. The unique affordance of digital
environments, according to McGann and Clement, is that they allow for
numerable interventions upon the textual object. The emphasis shifts
from viewing text as something stable and self-evident to something
dynamic and subject to different readings. As Clement explains: “A
model of textuality that represents text as a spatial and temporal
phenomenon might allow for interactions and representations in a
digital environment that, rather than insisting on fixity, foreground
principles of emergence” ("Rationale" 34).

<p>
This point bears repeating&#x2014;we are always stuck within the bodies of
our thinking. As such, we might as well turn to ourselves, to explore
(rather than how things are in the world) how things are <i>to
us</i>. Sedgwick points out that the problem is not one of knowledge, but
one of movement. We can try to in-<i>corporate</i>, as much as possible,
alternative reading methods that get at the unique experience of being
a thinking/feeling human that is fiddling with these tools. We can, in
other words, examine the possibilities of <i>touching</i> what we read. And
we can do so with digital tools for text analysis and machine
learning.  However, there still exists a view that distant reading
lacks the sensitivity of close reading. "Critics who want to
sensitively describe the merits of a single work usually have no need

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-3">
<p>
For those that would argue that negative feelings are no longer
relevant in today's world, Heather Love responds that the advent of
assimilation, of popular acceptance, only creates more problems for a
group that has come into being as abject. <i>(the corrolary for digital
studies is the proliferation of data, of information, digitization)</i>
Queer assimilation and apparent rise in acceptance across popular
culture and mass media contradicts the reality of shame and stigma
that everyday queers experience, a contradiction that breeds ever more
shame: "Of course, same-sex desire is not as impossible as it used to
be; as a result, the survival of feelings such as shame, isolation,
and self-hatred into the post-Stonewall era is often the occasion for
further feelings of shame. The embarrassment of owning such feelings,
out of place as they are in a movement that takes pride as its
watchword, is acute" (4). What do we do with these residual feelings
of shame?
</p>

<p>
How should queer criticism orient itself? Love shows that critics face
a contradiction, brought on by the reality of negative feelings and
psychic costs of being queer in a homophobic society. The narrative
trajectory of queer progress runs counter to the residual pain of
being queer. Criticism is stuck in the middle of this ambivalence,
between affirming its pride and bemoaning its suffering: "We are not
sure if we should explore the link between homosexuality and loss, or
set about proving that it does not exist" (Love 3).

<h4 id="org812a4b0"><span class="section-number-4">1.8.4</span> Critique of affirmation: Cvetkovitch</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-4">
<p>
Attempts to affirm negative queer experience can be harmful. Ann
Cvetkovitch's work on trauma studies provides an example of how this
tendency can create further misunderstanding about suffering. In her
book, <i>Archive of Feelings</i>, Cvetkovitch explores expressions of
trauma within the public sphere. She asks how individuals might
reclaim some of the most negative and traumatic feelings into
something positive and theraputic: "I want to place moments of extreme
trauma alongside moments of everyday emotional distress that are often
the only sign that trauma's effects are still being felt” (3). She
wrests trauma studies out of medical discourse and into public
culture&#x2014;turning something that is traditionally private and
pathologized into something communitarian, an open, everyday "archive
of feelings."
</p>

<p>
Importantly, Cvetkovitch marshalls this reconfiguration of trauma to
expand what we consider the 'archive'. She also makes some incisive
points about the inability to fully portray suffering: "Because trauma
can be unspeakable and unrepresentable and because it is marked by
forgetting and dissociation, it often seems to leave behind no records
at all" (7). Cvetkovitch explores alternative methods of figuring
trauma, which are transformed when they enter the public sphere. She
cites examples from public performances like rock shows or
documentaries, in which the artists enact "moments of intense affect
that are transformative or revealing” (26). 
</p>

<p>
Although her focus on the affective and ephemeral dimension of
performance opens up conceptions of the archive, Cvetkovitch perhaps
goes too far when she suggests that these performances are redemptive
or in some way compensate for traumatic experience. She indicates that
such performances go so far as to alleviate psychological damage and
suffering: “Imaginative work that may bear an oblique relation to the
actual event of sexual abuse can ultimately be more ‘healing’ than an
explicit rendering of the event” (94). Trauma is a real medical
condition, with real consequences (death) for those who do not seek
treatment or downplay its life-threatening effects. Critics should be
careful in extending a definition of trauma that will end up hurting
those who are affected by it. We do not need to move trauma strictly
from the medical discourse in order to have a more communitarian,
open, and public relationship to it. There are other ways to confront
stigma which doesn’t attempt to redeem it, as Love explores with her
notion of “Feeling Backward.”
</p>

<p>
The step that Cvetkovitch takes with regard to trauma is interesting,
however, for what it suggests about the role of the critic in
analysis. The point isn't to find evidence of overcoming queer
suffering, but to examine the ways that queerness is figured in
abstraction. What does queerness look like, what can it do?

"Disidentification is about recycling and rethinking encoded

the encoded message of a cultural text in a fashion that both exposes
the encoded message's universalizing and exlusionary machinations and
recircuits its workings to account for, include, and empower minority
identities and identifications. Thus disidentification is a step
further than cracking open the code of the majority: it proceeds to
use this code as raw material for representing a disempowered politics

culture" (<i>Disidentifications</i> 31).

"The chapters that make up this study attempt to chart the ways

[to be expanded in depth later in the chapter] My understanding
of Queer Subjectivity draws from Michel Foucault's theorizations of
the constructedness of sexuality and Judith Butler's points about the
incompleteness of subject formation. According to Foucault, "Sexuality
must not be thought of as a kind of natural given which power tries to
hold in check, or an an obscure domain which knowledge tries to
gradually uncover. It is the name that can be given to a historical
construct: not a furtive reality that is difficult to grasp, but a
great surface network in which the stimulation of bodies, the
intensification of pleasures, the incitement to discourse, the
formation of special knowledges, the strengthening of controls and
resistances, are linked to one another" (<i>History of Sexuality,
Vol. 1</i> 105-106). Butler asserts that "the impossibility of a full
recognition, that is, of ever fully inhabiting the name by which one's
social identity is inaugurated and mobilized, implies the instability
and incompleteness of subject-formation" ("Critically Queer,"
18). [this note needs to work harder to link Foucault &amp; Butler]

[this footnote needs to be integrated to the main text?] José
Esteban Muñoz defines queerness as "a structuring and educated mode of
desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of the
present&#x2026; Queerness is a longing that propels us onward, beyond
romances of the negative and toiling in the present. Queerness is that
thing that lets us feel that this world is not enough, that indeed
something is missing" (<i>Cruising Utopia</i> 1). Muñoz here indicates an
imminant quality about queerness, which is situated within the
present. Because queerness is "not yet here," it calls for something
else, for something that "allows us to see and feel beyond the
quagmire of the present," opening a space for emergent affects. In
other words, queerness expands a sensibility of feeling to include

Data, at the fundamental level, is a series of optically
invisible (but very physical) traces on a magnetized surface, which
assume virtual form on the screen. Kirschenbaum explains that "a
digital environment is an abstract projection supported and sustained
by its capacity to propagate the illusion (or call it a working model)
of immaterial behavior: identification without ambiguity, transmission
without loss, repetition without originality" (<i>Mechanisms: New Media
and the Forensic Imagination</i>, 11).

Andrew Piper's methodology, which he calls "bifocal" reading,
demonstrates how distant and close reading are used together, with
distant reading providing the context or framework that guides close
reading"“We are no longer using our own judgments as benchmarks&#x2026; but
explicitly constructing the context through which something is seen as
significant (and the means through which significance is
assessed)&#x2026;. It interweaves subjectivity with objects” (Piper,

He measures the "gendering of words used in characterization"
("Machine Learning and Human Perspective" 95), that is, gender
portrayed in novels by women and in novels by men. The verticle axis
visualizes the representation of words by women, and the horizontal by
men, with positive numbers signifying overrepresentation of these
terms. So terms on the top right are words that are used often by men
and women writers, and terms in the upper left and lower right are
ones used most often by women and men, respectively.

Da's emphasis on the “reproducible” in CLS extends Franco
Moretti's originating call for a “falsifiable criticism”: both
advocate for a methodology that is as reliable and verifiable as the
social sciences. According to Moretti: “Testing” literary
interpretations be the same process as in scientific disciplines &#x2013;
demanding that interpretations are “coherent, univocal, and complete,”
and are tested against “data” that appears to contradict it (<i>Signs</i>
21). (another quote: “The day criticism gives up its battle cry ‘it is
possible to interpret this element in the following way,’ to replace
it with the much more prosaic, ‘the following interpretation is
impossible for such and such a reason,’ it will have taken a huge step
forward on the road of methodological solidity” (<i>Signs</i> 22).)
