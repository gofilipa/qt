<p>
The burden of the chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of performativity, and how that
method enhances the critical process. It begins by debunking the
fantasy of falsifiable criticism, presenting a critique of moretti's
methodology and stylistic approach (eventually with accompanying text
analysis). It then goes into a critique of current distant reading
practices, discussing Ted Underwood, Nan Z. Da, to emphasize how these
practices can often reproduce the critic's assumptions. This section
also discusses the work of Johanna Drucker and Richard Jean So,
emphasizing that their methods do a good job deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I'm interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by producing new structures, or formalizations of these
texts. Then, I go into a history of textual scholarship, focusing
particularly on the work of Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode, who offer a deformative and speculative understanding
of critical analysis that is useful for my proposal. Then, I dip into
Queer Theory, in particular Judith Butler's concepts of performativity
and citation, which lend an understanding to the ways that critical
processes can subvert dominant structures through iteration, or
"performative citation." This notion of displacement through
repetition is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the
iterative process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures
that re-signify certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with
my reading of Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando</i>, to show how our
understanding of "man" and "woman" in that text is re-signified
through this kind of text analysis.

"paranoid reading," "militant reading," and "sympotmatic reading," is
a reading pratice that places the importance of meaning in what a text
does not say, what it cannot say.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Originally popularized by
Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this reading
practice descends from a style of critique driven by an almost
paranoid belief that power structures (the economy, the unconscious,
and moral systems, respectively) encode a certain ideology which will
finally be demystified by critical analysis and exposure. In literary
criticism, this kind of reading takes many names. Eve Kofosky Sedgwick
describes it as "paranoid reading"--<i>paranoid</i> because it searches for
hidden elements of text that play into a larger narrative about
resistance against a system of oppression. For Sedgwick, this kind of
reading places its faith in the "drama of exposure," which will once
and for all, finally reveal the truth. Similar to paranoid reading,
Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus define "symptomatic reading" as an
interpretive practice that locates latent patterns or “absences, gaps,
and ellipses in texts,” then speculates upon “what those absences
mean, what forces create them, and how they signify the questions that
motivate the text” (3). Often, this kind of reading is driven by the
conviction that criticism aims to register correct descriptions of a
text’s meaning or its relationship to reality.
</p>

<p>
In itself, this kind of reading practice can be an exhilarating and
rewarding exercise for literary criticism. But, as the above critics
argue, it can also evacuate some of the more [pleasurable and
productive] qualities of literary analysis. First, it discourages
attention from the aesthetic qualities of the text and instead directs
it to what is hidden or absent. Forsaking the surface level of the
text, this approach instead adopts an attitude of suspicion about what
is below the surface, or what is not there at all. Rita Felski
describes this orientation as "militant" because it grows from an
affect of disenchantment between between reader and text, where the
reader enlists "to expose hidden truths and draw out unflattering and
counterintuitive meanings that others fail to see" (1). Second, in
this process, textual elements are conscripted into supporting what
Sedgwick calls "a binary mode of thinking"&#x2013;searching beneath, behind,
or beyond the text, instead of considering how phenomenon might exist
on the surface (8). This process creates a formula for literary
analysis, turning reading into a mechanical practice of searching for
what is hidden or absent which will finally explain some latent
meaning in the text. Sedgwick explains that this reading process
imposes an "unhelpful structure" for analysis, where the complex
substance of textuality is conscripted into the interplay between
"repression and liberation" (12). Finally, such a process induces its
own replication. Because paranoia seeks its own affirmation, and its
nature is to spread. it reflects and confirms its own desire on every
surface. This process is replicated as the search for meaning takes on
other texts, imposing the same structure on new material. This
contagiousness, each time, will surface something new, but never
entirely novel. Sedgwick "see[s] a cognitive danger in these
interpretations: a moralisitic tautology that became increasingly
incabable of recognizing itself as such" (12). In short, paranoid
reading encourages a kind of criticism that is reproducible.

&#x2013;&gt; Computational methods give the critic more absence to mine in the
form of "big data." Distant reading by Moretti ramps up the apparent
"automation" in analysis toward furthering criticism.
</p>

<p>
This kind of reading is particularly suceptible to digital methods for
literary criticism. Sometimes, in digital methods like quantitative
text analysis, or the computational processing of textual elements,
features, and style, the problem of absence is replaced with the
problem of scale. Because computers can process hundreds of texts at a
time, they offer critics the possibility of getting around the problem
of literary scale. Additionally, the supposed "objectivity" of
computer processing emboldens some critics in the kind of claims they
make about literary history. For some, the capacity of the computer to
process vast amounts of text enables them to pose and answer ambitious
questions about literary history. Franco Moretti's work, for example,
examines the impact of social and economic forces upon literary form
to pose broad questions about how these forms developed in the modern
age of the novel. In his collection, <i>Distant Reading</i>, Moretti
declares that "distance…  is a condition of knowledge," where it works
to abstract information that would otherwise be too large to consider
(48). Ted Underwood, who works in the field of Computational Literary
Studies (CLS), harnesses the power of quantification and machine
learning to glimpse what he calls the "distant horizon" of literary
trends across centuries<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. More often than not, this kind of
distant reading is combined with close reading methods, as critics
will use the results of quantitative analysis to identify key moments
from the text that merit closer attention.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Underlying Moretti’s work is a deep concern with finding a method that
may connect historical forces with literary form. Pior to the
development of distant reading, Moretti called for a “falsifiable
criticism” to help ascertain the link between formalism and
history. Moretti objects to the analytical practice of contemporary
literary critics that "revolve[s] around concepts such as ‘ambiguity’
and the like" (Signs Taken for Wonders 22). According to Moretti,
"criticism will always, inexorably, be pushed into multiplying, rather
than reducing, the obstacles every social science encounters when it
tries to give itself a testable foundation" (22). He then explains his
criteria for a "falsifiable criticism," which borrows from social
scientific methodology:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In principle, the criteria for testing literary interpretations should
be the same as those already in use in every other scientific
discipline. One should in other words demand of an interpretation that
is coherent, univocal, and complete. And the test will consist in
comparing it with data which—-in the text or texts that constitute its
object—-appear contradictory or inexplicable in the light of the
hypothesis itself. <i>Signs Taken for Wonders</i> 21
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, Moretti proposes a mode of critical inquiry that minimizes the
potential for difference and disagreement by laying an empirical
method that facilitates "coherent, univocal, and complete"
interpretations. Moretti's early reflections reveal a concern with the
"falsifiable" that drives his development toward "quantitative
formalism."
</p>

<p>
Moretti's distant reading conscripts digital methods toward the kind
of truth searching of paranoid reading. In his later work, Moretti
quantifies literary history and textual data through a series of
visualizations, such as graphs and diagrams. His approach attributes
the bulk analysis in computational processes, and the literary
critic's role to interpret the results of analysis. The essays in
<i>Distant Reading</i> increasingly demonstrate how his critical method is
streamlines into the neat, recursive processes of hypothesis,
collecting and assembling data, and inference. The results are
sometimes unexpected, but thoroughly enlightening, and occasionally
bring Moretti to reframe his hypotheses. In “Style, Inc.: Reflections
on 7,000 Titles (British Novels, 1740-1850),” Moretti plots data about
book titles on a series of graphs in order to speculate on market
forces&#x2013;"the title is where the novel as language meets the novel as
commodity" (181). Moretti summarizes his conclusion: "As the market
expands, titles contract; as they do that, they learn to compress
meaning; and as they do that, they develop special ‘signals’ to place
books in the right market niche” (204). His language attributes the
force of his analysis to the quantitative process:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
<i>describe</i> a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
<i>try to explain</i> its causes; next, I <i>suggest</i> how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I <i>make a little attempt</i> at quantitative
stylistics, examining some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Though his speculations are provocative, Moretti presents them as
supplementary to the graphs. Moretti’s diminishing language&#x2013;he
describe[s], tr[ies] to explain, suggest[s] and make[s] a little
attempt&#x2013;belies the nature of his intervention. After all, it is
Moretti who poses the question, inputs the data, and interprets the
graphs with his conclusion: “between the size of the market, and the
length of the titles, a strong negative correlation emerged: as the
one expanded, the other contracted” (188). The power of the computer
emboldens Moretti to make larger claims about literary history, all
the while diminishing his role as in analysis.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<p>
&#x2013;&gt; Ramsay shows us how computational processes can aid in critical
    reflection to go beyond paranoid reading into a more speculative,
    albeit inconclusive, method.
</p>

<p>
There are literary critics who, eschewing the temptation of the
paranoia, employ the "distance" of distant reading toward more
speculative and creative ends. Stephen Ramsay, for example, approaches
"the rigid, inexorable, uncompromising logic of algorithmic
transformations" as an opportunity for contemplative analysis
(32). Rather than solve problems or answer questions definitively, he
engages in readings that are inescapably partial and
speculative. Ramsay explains that computational methods enhance
current reading strategies by harnessing the constraints of
computation so that new readings may flourish: “The computer
revolutionizes, not because it proposes an alternative to the basic
hermeneutical procedure, but because it reimagines that procedure at
new scales, with new speeds, and among new sets of conditions”
(31). Activities such as compiling word frequency lists, diagramming
social relationships, or plotting various textual data not only
transform texts into new forms from which the critic may speculate,
but are grounded in inherently critical moves, such as asking
questions or identifying problems. Ramsay maintains that all critical
reading is a deformative activity insofar as it prioritizes certain
textual data such as formal patterns, words, devices over others and
delivers a new "paratext." For example, in his analysis of Virginia
Woolf’s novel <i>The Waves</i>, Ramsay uses a computer program to generate
lists of distinctive terms uttered by each of the six speakers in the
novel. Ramsay emphasizes how this method “puts forth not the
[original] text, but a new text in which the data has been
paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (16). To
say, as a result, that the word frequencies "confirm" or "verify" what
other critics have argued about the characters assumes that literary
criticism aims for singular answers. Rather, the point of such an
exercise is to “unleash the potentialities” of the text, offering
opportunities for new readings (33). Ramsay point out that “we are not
trying to solve Woolf. We are trying to ensure that discussion of <i>The
Waves</i> continues” (15). Here, the goal is a rhetorical exercise:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The understanding promised us by the critical act arises not from a
presentation of facts, but from the elaboration of a gestalt, and it
rightfully includes the vague reference, the conjectured similitude,
the ironic twist, and the dramatic turn. In the spirit of inventio,
the critic freely employs the rhetorical acts of conjecture—not so
that a given matter can be settled, but in order that the matter might
become richer, deeper, and ever more complicated. 16
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ramsay's method uses speed and efficiency of the machine to reflect
back upon the critic, to give the critic more material and more
opportunity for the creativity and speculation that characterizes
literary analysis.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-4">
<p>
There is significant overlap distant reading and algorithmic criticism
in that they visualize or arrange textual data to stimulate
analysis. Moretti, if you follow his thought, is actually engaging in
a speculative method, using visualization to spark his imagination and
make conjectures, which he disguises them “explanations”. He is
transforming texts into new configurations (such as diagrams or word
frequency lists) that stimulate potential readings. However, because
Moretti and Ramsay are trying to answer quite different questions,
their analysis takes them in different directions. In the pursuit of
the falsifiable, Moretti evacuates much of his method's creative
potential. The difference between them has largely to do not with
method, but with orientation. Moretti's suspicion stems from the
conviction that the archive of literary history has something to
hide. Rita Felski explains that something that many of these critics
do not address&#x2014;the role of affect in criticism. Her critique of
“hermeneutics of suspicion,” which she calls a militant mode of
reading, finds that the desire to unearth or discover secrets in the
text is actually a harmful one, because it forecloses possibilities of
connection and being moved by these texts. The affective modes of
suspicion include disenchantment, vigilance, paranoia. Felski wonders
what if we allowed ourselves to be marked or struck by what we
read. Then, rather than just be a cognitive activity, reading can
become an “embodied mode of attentiveness that involves us in acts of
sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering, and engaging” (176). She
wants to bring the body back into criticism. Ramsay is not only
willing to be surprised, he is driven by a desire for surprise.

<p>
Ramsay demonsrates how one might use text analysis to do this kind of
speculative work that leads to novel results. But how do we do this in
a way that engages gender and sexuality in textuality? Queerness, like
other areas of marginalization, is often approached as hidden and
obscured. Queer theorists approach text as holding its secret below
the surface. To avoid this paranoid position, we might look to engage
with queerness as an aestheticized quality, as something that operates
on the surface of the text, without conscripting it into the logic of
"prohibition or liberation," like Sedgwick says.  We are looking at
distant reading, not to compensate for speed or efficiency, but for
the ways that it allows us to re-read the surface of our texts.
</p>

<p>
How can we read the queerness of texts not by what they hide, but what
they show? This chapter proposes a method of reading that grapples
with the tension to unearth hidden, latent, or absent meaning in
text. It takes this tension to texts that have a history of embedding
ideology about marginalized identities, particularly about
sexuality. The stakes is preserving the role of the aesthetics in
critique. How can the reconfiguration&#x2013;the abstraction&#x2013;provided by
the machine allow us to engage with queerness in texts?

<p>
Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando: A Biography</i> is a fictional biography that
follows the life of a 16th-century English nobleman, Orlando, as he
undergoes a sex change and lives into the 20th century as a woman. As
he recounts the life of Orlando, the biographer-narrator mocks the
techniques of historical biographers by continualling calling into
question the ability of language to adequately describe life.
</p>

<p>
From the beginning, the text displays the biographer's ambivalence
about how to describe Orlando and presents two possible
perspecties&#x2013;that of the poet, and that of the biographer:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; Orlando's face, as he threw the window open, was lit solely by
the sun itself. A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to
find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still the biographer who
records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he
invoke the help of novelist or poet. From deed to deed, from glory to
glory, from office to office he must go, his scribe following after,
till they reach whatever seat it may be that is the height of their
desire. Orlando, to look at, was cut out precisely for some such
career. The red of the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on
the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The
lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an
exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in
its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted
closely to the head. But, alas, that these catalogues of youthful
beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes. Alas, that
people are seldom born devoid of all three; for directly we glance at
Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like
drenched violets, so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in
them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome
pressed between the two blank medallions which were his
temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we
rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit
a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer
to ignore. 12-13
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the biographer declares Orlando’s beautiful face a good subject
for biography. The biographer asserts his aims are to record Orlando,
"following after" him, "from deed to deed, from glory to glory, from
office to office" (12). The description of Orlando's face begins
soberly enough with straightforward sentence structure using simple
"to be" verbs that describe Orlando's features with some insertion of
modest figurative comparisons (the "peach down" ob the lips, teeth of
"an exquisite and almond whiteness," the "tense flight" of the "arrowy
nose," etc). However, when the biographer arrives to Orlando's eyes
and forehead, his style ascends into full-fledged figuration: he "must
admit that [Orlando] had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the
water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them." The
biographer's problem, that Orlando is too beautiful for literal
description&#x2013;“Directly we glance at the eyes and forehead, we have to
admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good
biographer to ignore”&#x2013;requires him to draw on the strategies of the
poet, using imagery and simile.
</p>

<p>
For the biographer, the main challenge is to describe Orlando's life
in a way that is objective and literal, in keeping with the principles
of biography. However the biographer runs up against an issue with his
work in a key moment of the text, when Orlando undergoes the change of
sex from male to female. The record of Orlando’s life at this stage is
incomplete: "It is, indeed, highly unfortunate, and much to be
regretted that at this stage of Orlando's career&#x2026; we have least
information to go upon" (88). A fire breaks out, destroying part of
the manuscript that the biographer uses as source material:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Often the paper was scorched a deep brown in the middle of the most
important sentence. Just when we thought to elucidate a secret that
has puzzled historians for a hundred years, there was a hole in the
manuscript big enough to put your finger through. We have done our
best to piece out a meagre summary from the charred fragments that
remain; but often it has been necessary to speculate, to surmise, and
even to use the imagination. 88
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The biographer explains that he must work from fragments, and as a
result, must draw from speculation. 
</p>

<p>
Within the level of the story, Orlando undergoes a similar struggle
with language's ability to convey objective truth. In developing his
poetic sensibility, Orlando takes particular issue with the potential
for language to signify real-world referents. He is attempting to
describe the color of the grass and the sky, but remains discouraged
by the efficacy of his language:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'The sky is blue,' he said, 'the grass is green.' Looking up, he saw
that, on the contrary, the sky is like the veils which a thousand
Madonnas have let fall from their hair; and the grass fleets and
darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs
from enchanted woods. 'Upon my word,' he said (for he had fallen into
the bad habit of speaking aloud), 'I don't see that one's more true
than another. Both are utterly false.' And he despaired of being able
to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into
a deep dejection. 75
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Orlando cannot comprehend whether plain english (“the sky is blue; the
grass is green”) is preferable to figurative language (“she sky is
like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall from their
hair; the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the
embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods”). For Orlando, both
seem false. 
</p>

<p>
As Orlando undergoes a sex change and falls in love, his issues with
language begin to resolve. In a scene that evokes the prior one on the
grass, Orlando is in Hyde Park, watching a toy boat negotiate a
wavelet on the Serpentine river. Momentarily, the boat is dissapears
then re-emerges on the other side of the wavelet. Orlando associates
this moment with the word “ecstasy”, and hurries to telegram the
phrase, ‘a toy boat on the serpentine’ and ‘ecstasy’, to her lover,
who she knows will immediately understand what it means. As she
hurries to the post office, she meditates on the nature of language
and literature, which she now realizes is violently ecstatic. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,' she repeated, thus enforcing upon
herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor
eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter; it's
something useless, sudden, violent; something that costs a life; red,
blue, purple; a spirit; a splash; like those hyacinths (she was passing a
fine bed of them); free from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or
care for one's kind; something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth,
husband I mean, Bonthrop: that's what it is&#x2013;a toy boat on the
Serpentine, ecstasy&#x2013;it's ecstasy that matters. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unlike the grass and sky from the previous scene, language now has the
power to signify. "A toy boat" and "ecstasy" are reduced to the same
meaning, a common denominator of feeling. This reduction elevates the
potential for language to capture and convey meaning. The symmetry of
these two episodes shows how Orlando moves beyond a disappointment in
the limitations of language for expression to a new faith in its power
to mean.
</p>

<p>
As Orlando resolves her struggle with language, so does the
biographer. Increasingly, the biographer drops this pretension toward
accuracy and boldly speculates, without excuses, elements of the
story. At one point, the biographer draws the reader into this
speculation. At this moment, Orlando mets her lover, Shel, a ship
captain who exhibits as many feminine qualities as Orlando does
masculine. The biographer describes a scene of their early courtship:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
'Shel, my darling,' she began again, 'tell me&#x2026;' and so they talked
two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and really it
would profit little to write down what they said, for they knew each
other so well that they could say anything, which is tantamount to
saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things as how to cook an
omelette, or where to buy the best boots in London, things which have
no lustre taken from their setting, yet are positively of amazing
beauty within it. For it has come about, by the wise economy of
nature, that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language; the
commonest expressions do, since no expressions do; hence the most
ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and the most poetic is
precisely that which cannot be written down. For which reasons we
leave a great blank here, which must be taken to indicate that the
space is filled to repletion.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The biographer here explains that this conversation would come across
as extremely ordinary and boring to the reader, although it was
actually beautiful and poetic when it took place. An ordinary
conversation can be poetic at the moment of expression, delivered or
said in a way that is beautiful, which may then lose in language. The
reader then encounters a space break which the biographer instructs
her to imagine is "filled to repletion." This space break reinvokes
the episode with the manuscript, where the biographer points out that
there are holes or gaps in the record. However, while it was
previously a problem with evidence, now it is a problem with
language. According to the biographer, the means to express this
conversation doesn’t exist in language. As a result, the biographer
invites the reader to fill in the space. To use speculation and
guesses as to what happened. The reader must do what the biographer
did when he confronted the lack of evidence, which was to guess what
happens from the available evidence.
</p>

<p>
Comparing the biographer and Orlando's experiences with language
surface an interesting insight: imagination works to both reduce and
elevate language. In one case, the word "ecstasy" is endowned with
powerful meaning, or the ability to mean. In the other, words in fact
lose their ability to convey, so the language of absence take their
place. But the critical move amounts to the same. Both assert the
reader's role in constructing meaning. Words have the power to
signify, but not in themselves, inert and sterile on the page. They
require the imagination from the reader. 
</p>

<p>
In troubling the line between objective reality and subjective
experience, Woolf’s parodic biography explores how language and gender
are similarly (and coordinately) constructed. This development in
language both within the story and on the level of narration is
coordinated with Orlando's gender development. Orlando's struggle with
the ability of words to mean and the biographer's struggle to tell a
story of a life, begins to resolve after the gender change. The
difficulty with language that Orlando and the biographer both
experience becomes less and less of an issue as Orlando comes into her
femininity, which is to say, becomes comfortable in herself. These
changes are possible because the narrative embraces the influence of
the imaginary in language, in minding meaning in words and in
storytelling. This allows Orlando to accept the role of the
imagination in gender, in making gender meaningful.
</p>

<p>
I will use text analysis to further explore the relationship between
these themes: language, gender, and the imagination. So the question
then becomes: how are language and gender co-constructed in Orlando?
What is the role of the imagination in gender/language? What is the
relation between gender, language, and the imagination?

Major developments in technology also perpetuate racial
assumptions. Moving from networking technologies to software
development, Tara McPherson explores the parallels between the
Operating Systems and race relations, to show how the development of
computer software betrays hegemonic assumptions about whiteness and
elisions of difference.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> She focuses on the key moment of 1960s
United States, when Operating Systems, which is the foundational
software that supports a computer's programs and basic functioning,
developed alongside civil rights discourses. Her research focuses on
how "the organization of information and capital" in OS development
resonates in the struggles for racial justice: "Many of these shifts
were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
radicalism" (30). McPherson deconstructs the UNIX operating system
which includes a hierarchical file system, a command line interpreter
(the Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), and a variety of
software programs that are designed to work in tandem. McPherson
points out that UNIX-based Operating Systems (like Mac and Linux) are
distinguished by the ways that they partition and simplify complex
processes into discrete components, similar to the ways that identity
politics cordones off parts of the (social and technological) system
into distinct units. While this cordoning was productive for the
promotion of civil rights, it also, according to McPherson, "curtailed
and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing
struggle to fairly discrete parameters" (30).
</p>

<p>
Crystallizing the intersection between Operating Systems and race
relations, McPherson asserts that "Certain modes of racial visibility
and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing
data" (24). McPherson emphasizes the "rules" of UNIX philosophy, which
lay out how UNIX's development prioritized the organization and
simplification of data processing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear
by demonstration that nothing else will do. Rule of Transparency:
Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier&#x2026; Rule
of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be
stupid and robust. 26
</p>

The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions. The rule of "Transparency" flattens
nuance and ambiguity, making program components as legible as
possible. The rule of "Representation," particularly the suggestion to
"Fold knowledge into data" reduces the complexity of raw data, so that
it can be easily input into multiple processes. According to
McPherson, all of these rules work together to shore up the central
design theory of "modularity,"<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> which stipulates that components
are self-contained and interoperable, so they can be independently
created, modified, and replaced without affecting the whole system.

<p>
The role of control in creating the internet and the emphasis on data
reduction in developing operating stystems leave their legacies on
21st century digital technology, where race becomes collapsed into
data. Echoing McPherson, Ruha Benjamin asserts that technology
reproduces social inequities under the guise of objectivity and
progressivism.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> Turning to technology, Benjamin explores how
innovations in Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic computing
extend racist paradigms into ever new tools, particularly in data
gathering and surveillance. The creators of these new technologies
mark, track, and quantify blackness, for example, in databases for
healthcare or financial services that associate "black names" with
criminality (Benjamin 5). With each update, technology is continually
promoted as efficient and progressive in a way that masks how it
exploits data about its subjects. Benjamin explains, "we are told that
how tech sees “difference” is a more objective reflection of reality
than if a mere human produced the same results&#x2026; bias enters through
the backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6). As she points out, "the road
to inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7). Like the creators of
UNIX, the creators of such tools and algorithms operate under
assumptions of white universality that inevitably marks blackness as
"other."

<p>
Let us now turn to computational methods, seeing how they bear out
some of the legacies from the above technological
histories. 
</p>

<p>
Practitioners of "distant reading," a critical method at the
intersection of Literary Studies and Data Science, use quantitative
analysis to study works of literature. This process involves deploying
computer programs to clean, categorize, and count elements in textual
data, and is often followed by interpretive analysis, where the critic
engages the results of quantification from a humanities
lense. 
</p>

<p>
According to its practitioners, distant reading is most useful for the
ways it allows connections to emerge among vast amounts of textual
data. Underwood's argument convincingly begins with the observation
that human capacities of sight, attention, and memory preclude them
from grasping the larger patterns of literary history across
time. Distant reading, where "distance" means abstraction, or the
simplification of textual data into computable objects such as
publication dates and genres, allows critics to see connections amid
the swarm of overflowing information.
</p>

<p>
Among distant reading practitioners, Underwood's approach is unique in
that he models the ways that human assumptions can affect the results
of analysis. Underwood is careful to point out the subjective nature
of his method, which he calls "perspectival modelling," by turning it
into an object of study. He uses machine learning, or programs
"trained" by certain data sets, to create models that can then make
predictions on other datasets. He explains that, "Since learning
algorithms rely on examples rather than fixed definitions, they can be
used to model the tacit assumptions shared by particular communities
of production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
93). One of his projects examines gender roles in novels from the
18th century to the 21st century by using a machine-learning model to
"guess" the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated
with that character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on&#x2013;excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like <i>boyhood</i> or <i>wife</i>. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. <i>Distant Horizons</i> 115
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In simplest terms, the program studies some given adjectives
associated with a male or female character in order to make
predictions about other characters' genders. Inevitably, the resulting
output is always determined by this initial input. Underwood carefully
asserts that these models reveal, not the truth of literary histroy,
but the approaches and choices made by those who create the models:
"Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and
rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence
used to train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
92). This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles
in novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 114). The graph shows a steady
overlapping of words traditionally associated with women, such as
"heart," with words typically assoicated with men, like "passion,"
toward the middle of the 20th century. One of the many explanations
for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice of writing
became more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the middle of the
20th century than it was previously (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 137). This
fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about men than
women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline in
female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly paradoxical
conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while the actual
prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be possible.
</p>

<p>
However, the results of Underwood's "perspectival modeling" can only
be as good as the questions he asks. From a critical gender
perspective, Underwood's approach imposes the very structure that he
is attempting to deconstruct. In other project, he where he similarly
measures the "transformations" of gender across time periods, he
explains that simplification is necessary ("Machine Learnig and Human
Perspective" 93):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Underwood admits that he needs a "simple" model in order to bring into
relation the dynamics of gender (See Fig. 2).<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> However, he
underestimates the extent to which his initial assumptions determine
the final result. Although he considers the possibility that he finds
a structural tension between gender "because [he] explores gender, for
the most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant Horizons 140), he
neglects to consider how the collapsing of gender into a single graph
perpetuates the structural categories of male/female in a way that is
neglects the assumptions behind such a category.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> Moreover, the
issue is not just with the assumptions at the outset which reproduces
the result, but with the guiding question of the entire project, which
is not about deconstructing gender, but about reifying it. To begin
with, why should humanists seek to automate the conscription of gender
norms within these terms? Asking a machine to replicate the
conscription of gender for the purpose of seeing how male and female
roles in novels change over time only creates a model of gender that
is "simple" enough to be computed by the system. How does simplifying
the concept of gender contribute to our study of it? The results of
using the machine can only be as good as the questions we ask.

<p>
Critiquing scholars like Underwood, Nan Z. Da argues that quantitative
methods are ill-suited for literary criticism. She accusses Underwood
and other distant reading practitioners for trading "speed for
accuracy, and coverage for nuance" (620). Of her many gripes with
quantitative methods, which include "technical problems, logical
fallacies," and a "fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical tools
that are used and the objects to which they are applied" (601), she
emphasizes the lack of reproducible results, the idea that one
researcher's process can be reproduced by another with identical
output, which is essential to statistical methodologies. She
demonstrates with an experiment of Topic Modelling, which is the
processing of large texts in order to generate a number of "topics"
within the corpus. Researchers often use Topic Modelling as a way of
speed-reading a massive corpus to get a sense of what it is about
without having to actually look at the text. Da attempts to verify the
results of a Topic Modelling experiment by replicating the process on
her own machine, a replication that fails. She concludes that, "if the
method were effective, someone with comparable training should be able
to use the same parameters to get basically the same results"
(628-629).<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> For Da, reproducibility of method is a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of quantification.
</p>

<p>
Despite their vastly different committments, scholars like Underwood
align with Da on the value that they place on reproducibility, which
is an ultimately conservative investment. Underwood demonstrates how
the critic reproduces their assumptions in the questions and data used
at the outset in a way that structures the final result. Da's emphasis
on the reproducible suggests that, to be useful, quantitative literary
criticism ought to resemble something more like statistical analysis:
if the method can be verified, can be copied and reproduced, then the
interpretive conditions might be universalized.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
Underwood and Da overlook the way that quantification can be used to
disrupt assumptions or reveal the constructed nature of data. In
contrast to Underwood and Da, Johanna Drucker is careful to dispell
the illusion of "raw data," which comes already reduced to fit
whatever parameters required by analysis. Because data always
undergoes a transformation in order to be quantified, its complexity
has already been compromised. As a result, Drucker argues,
quantification techniques such as visualizations in graphs and charts
inevitably misrepresent the data they are meant to convey. To
illustrate this process, Drucker presents a chart displaying the
amount of books published over several years. The chart appears to
convey production during this specific time period, but Drucker
explains that publication date is an arbitrary metric for capturing
production.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup> She brings to the surface all the assumptions made
in such a metric, for example, the limitations of "novel" as a genre
and the connotations behind "published," which suggests date of
appearance, but has no indication of composition, editing, review,
distribution. Each piece of data carries with it the result of many
interpretive decisions, that carry with them varying degrees of
opacity, which are all necessary in order to present complex concepts
like book production as a bar on a chart. Drucker explains: "the
graphical presentation of supposedly self-evident
information&#x2026; conceals these complexities, and the interpretative
factors that bring the numerics into being, under a guise of graphical
legibility" (Drucker par. 23).
</p>

<p>
To resist the reductions of "data," a term that deceptively connotes
that which is "given," Drucker proposes thinking of data as "capta,"
which suggests that which is taken. Drucker's "capta" is deliberately
creative, turning graphical expressions into expressive metrics:
components used for measurement, like lines or bars on a graph, break,
blur, or bleed into one another. Objects are not discrete entities,
but interact with the other objects in the visualization. For example,
in a bar graph of book publications by year, she warps the graphical
metrics, making some of them fuzzy, wider, shorter, in an attempt to
show that publication as a metric elides other information such as
composition, editing, purchasing, etc.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/Drucker.png" alt="Drucker.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Emphasizing "capta" is a way of figuring elements that have been
reduced, resolved, or ignored in traditional quantitative
analysis. Drucker makes evident what is overlooked or assumed when
dealing with complex subjects by muddling (rather than simplifying)
the relationship between elements.

<h4 id="org0cb7bfa"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.4</span> Mandell: deconstructing gender with computation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-4">
<p>
Drucker points out how data that is taken (capta) can be rendered
graphically to sugesst the complexity of that data. Laura Mandell
similarly explores solutions for approaching the reduction of data,
particularly of gender, into what she calls the "M/F binary."<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>
Mandell critiques recent uses of stylometery by Matthew Jockers and
Jan Rybicki, which analyze "masculine" or "feminine" modes of writing
by computing syntax, diction, and other linguistic features. Mandell
demonstrates how the M/F binary is reified "by presenting conclusions
about “male” and “female” modes of thinking and writing as if the M/F
terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently
referential and not discursively constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's
examination marshalls key findings from feminist theory, drawing from
Judith Butler, among others, to assert that gender is a socially
constituted category, a "performance" that can be historicized. She
illustrates the guiding power of the M/F binary in her critique of
Jockers and Rybicki, which find that they essentialize gender by
relying on stereotypes in their premises.
</p>

<p>
Rather than discount quantitative methods, however, Mandell suggests
that it can open up the way we deconstruct our understanding of
quantification and gender: "if we admit that categories such as gender
are being constructed both by the measurer and the measured&#x2026; we
might then be able to use stylometry to experiment with new taxonomies
of gender" (par. 37). To demonstrate how gender is "constructed," she
poses a counter experiment with genre, which finds that genre analysis
cuts across the gender binary. She comapres the stylistic qualities of
a female writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, against two male writers,
William Godwin and Samuel Johnson, revealing that: "Wollstonecraft’s
sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble Godwin’s sentimental
anti-Jacobin novels&#x2026; whereas her essays most resemble Johnson’s
writings" (par. 29). Wollenstonecraft's writing resembles both male
and female writing, depending on the genre. To analyze the highly
constructed category of "gender," then, one must also consider genre:
"separating gender from other markings (genre, era of composition) is
not possible: historical time and genre are not incidental to, but
constitutive of, gender" (par. 35).
</p>

<p>
The similarities between gender and genre, however, work to evacuate
how gender is <i>constitutive</i> of the subject. She points out that both
are kinds of performance than can be learned: "features of both gender
and genre, while highly discernible, are also highly
imitable. (par. 30). Mandell asserts that "Anyone can adopt gendered
modes of behavior, just as anyone can write in genres stereotypically
labeled M/F" (par.30). Here, she takes Butler's points about gender
performativity beyond its purview: indeed, Butler's description of
performativity as a process, rather than a singular act, emphasizes
the lack of an autonomous subject that performs gender. In <i>Bodies
that Matter</i>, her follow-up to <i>Gender Trouble</i>, Butler explicitly
warns against the interpretation that gender is decided by the
subject, to be put on and off at will like clothing. Rather, according
to Butler, the subject <i>is produced</i> by gender, which allows the
subject to emerge: "construction is neither a subject nor its act, but
a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and 'acts' come to
appear at all" (xviii). Crucially, Butler asserts that gender
<i>precedes</i> and <i>constitutes</i> the subject. This is not to say that
Mandell is wrong about gender being constructed, but that her
assumption, that "categories such as gender are being constructed both
by the measurer and the measured" misses an important point about the
autonomy of subject (par. 38). According to Butler, the subject only
emerges as an effect of gendered performance.
</p>

<p>
Even so, Mandell's work suggests further ways of drawing attention to
the complexity of gender, which harness the interactive affordances of
the computer. Her emphasis on visualization and movement inform how
one might "animate numerical processes rather than fixing their
results as stereotype" (par. 7). The dynamicity of computation, which
allows one to run data iteratively, feeding new inputs into new
results, complicates any straighforward understanding of the M/F
binary. Mandell explains that “Computer screens&#x2026; afford the fluid
exploration of parameters and taxonomies, through which many sorts of
experiments can be tested: interactive visualizations can give us not
objective answers rooted in aggressively reductive oppositions, but
parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very complex reality”
(par. 38). She points to programming and visualization tools to
emphasize how they might multiply our understanding of gender:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We could break the algorithm’s capacity to produce “a strong gender
signal” by simply increasing the number of gender categories to be
sorted. Experts in the field could create metadata to generate a
completely new taxonomy to replace the tired M/F binary: “men writing
as men,” “women writing as women, “women writing as men,” “men writing
as women,” “unspecified (anonymous) writing as men,” “unspecified
writing as women,” “men writing as men (byline) in the voice of a
woman (woman narrator),” “men writing as unspecified (anonymous
byline) in the voice of a woman,” “women writing as men (byline) in a
voice of unspecified,” etc.—whatever categories are presented by title
pages, prefaces, narrators’ discourses, and research into authorship
attribution found. par. 36
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mandell points to manipulation of gender categories, which gives the
researcher more opportunities for input.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-5">
<p>
One example of distant reading explores how computation might handle
questions of racial identity and discourse in novels. Richard Jean So
and Edwin Roland use machine learning to explore the constructedness
of social categories like race by experimenting with an algorithm that
evaluates authorship by race according to the vocabulary used by the
author.  When they look more closely into these results, they find
that the algorithm reveals different levels of variance in words
traditionally attributed to white and black authors. While novels by
white authors are distinguished by a low variance in this vocabulary,
novels by black authors show a greater variance in vocabulary
(66). They conclude that white authorship as a category only coheres
when it evaluates against the incoherence of black authorship. Put
simply, they find that whiteness as a category <i>depends</i> on the
characterization of blackness.<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup> They point out that, of course,
this process is useful not for what we learn about race but for what
we learn about the machine, particularly in the way that the results
reveal errors that open up areas for further analysis. They isolate
one text, James Baldwin's novel, <i>Giovanni's Room</i> (1956), which was
wrongly categorized as being written by a white author. So and Roland
point out that this misclassification evokes a critical debate about
this text's elision of explicit references to race and sexuality,
whereby blackness is displaced in favor of an implicit whiteness that
serve to "cipher[s] identity" (69). The algorithm revealed six words
in <i>Giovanni's Room</i> that influenced the categorization, one of them
in particular signals white authorship, the term "appalled." This term
only occurs once in the text, in the early scene where David (the
narrator) describes his relationship to his father. Here, David
regrets his friendliness which comes at the expense of his
fatherliness: "I did not want to be his buddy. I wanted to be his
son. What passed between us as masculine candor exhausted and appalled
me" (Rpt. in So and Roland 71). So and Roland's analysis emphasize the
connotations of whiteness in "appalled," which has the middle French
root, "apalir," meaning "to grow pale" (71). They insightfully
conclude that the word "appalled" in the text marks "the moment David
develops a troubled relationship to normative masculinity [as] also
the moment he becomes 'white'" (71). Their analysis thus contributes
to the ongoing debate about the imbrication between race and sexuality
in the novel.
</p>

<p>
In a sense, So and Roland are confronting the same problem as Da: what
to do with a case of computational error [which comes with attendant
assumptions about reproducibility&#x2026;]. But rather than write off
quantitative methods, So and Roland suggest an interesting way out of
the problem: use the error as a starting point for further
analysis. While "Race is a category that escapes measurement or simply
renders it untenable," the machine is an apt tool for studying this
category (60). They isolate the error as an opportunity to explore the
differences in the ways humans and machines might approach racial
identity. Because race is a social construct, and machines only impute
meaning that is encoded into them, than it stands to reason that
machines might be ideal instruments for studying the construction of
race. Thus they turn the central mismatch between data analysis, which
works to "identify and label objects," and minority discourse
analysis, which "critique[s] and problematize[s] the very idea of
categories," into a point for interrogation (63). In this case, the
algorithm offers an opportunity for understanding how whiteness as a
category depends on the contrast of blackness as "other." Quantifying
race reinforces differences, reductions, stratification, as “Reading
race distantly thus requires quantification of racial identity or
racialized language” (60). Looking more closely at the specific
results of this analysis, like the function of the term "appalled" in
<i>Giovanni's Room</i>, they can make more daring leaps of speculation
about how whiteness, while displacing blackness, also gestures toward
a troubled understanding of gender and potentially, sexuality. So and
Roland assert that: "If the general class of the misclassified points
to the erosion of the machine's initial binary understanding of white
and black, a close analysis of a single misclassified text can reveal
what precisely motivates that ontological undoing" (68). Rather than
being "fundamentally mismatched," the machine and minority discourse
are particularly suited for one another, as the machine uses highly
constructed and reductive method that allows practitioners to
deconstruct social categories.
</p>

<p>
The example with "appalled" is totally idiosyncratic&#x2013;the word occurs
once through the entire novel. But paying attention to error upends
the value of reproducibility. Because race is a construct, we must use
a "reflexive method that is able to identify its own elisions while
also pointing to new insights and opportunities for research”
(72). Roland and So's work combines a deconstructive with a
speculative methodology. They run a computation, look for an error,
and use that error as an opportunity to learn about the ways that
categories are constructed. They assert their goals: “To illustrate
the limits of standard computational methods for the analysis of race
and to produce a series of results that nonetheless advance our
understanding of the texts and authors under investigation… exposing
the racial limitations of computation can reveal things otherwise
occluded within literary history” (61). They are using computers in an
unintuitive way, computing for indeterminacy. While this work is
essential for bringing together quantitative and critical race
discourses, it also doesn't give enough credit to the ways that
<i>computers</i>, in presenting formalized schemas of race, transform data
toward speculative ends. This is to suggest that perhaps a
deconstructive and specualtive methodology is too ambivalent. What if
we began with the notion of the appalled?  What if we looked further
into the way that race is generated by vocabulary?  Not in order to
further understand how race operates (computers will never be as
subtle thinkers as we are), but to direct human subtlety more attently
to computer output. What if, rather than using the machine to study
human constructs, we used the machine to spur human thinking?

According to Underwood, distant reading is less useful for studying a
single text in depth and more useful for taking a long view of larger
corpora. He sets up an opposition between computer and human reading:
"Computational analysis of a text is more flexible than it used to be,
but it is still quite crude compared to human reading; it helps mainly
with questions where evidence is simply too big to fit in a single
reader's memory" (xxi). He is right to point out that a computer
cannot (yet) draw inferences like a human can, and that a human cannot
"read" at the same speed as a computer. Yet, his emphasis on the
limitations of human memory suggests another way that that computers
can guide and enhance the human reading of smaller texts. What the
computer properly does is arrange a set of data&#x2013;of any size&#x2013;for
human consumption. This involves processing datasets into new forms
and configurations that can then be scrutinzed by a human
reader. Although Underwood uses distant reading to "to find a
perspective that makes&#x2026; scholars all congruent with each other,"
quantitative methods can supplement human memory by approaching
memory, specifically working memory, as a resource, rather than a
hindrance (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 32). The computer can re-arrange text in
a way that focuses the attention span of the reader on elements
previously unseen or overlooked. Underwood's focus on
falsifiability&#x2013;the idea that distant reading can process more
evidence to give a more "complete" picture&#x2013;blocks out the ways that
the ways that quantitative literary analysis, or distant reading,
works in coordination with existing human capacities.

Now we shift our attention to a body of literary criticism that offers

scholarship, and particularly the editorial practice of deformance,
opens up a way of thinking about data that is performative rather than
representative. Critics like Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode take an approach toward text that resists the
conservatism of traditional textual scholarship, which has generally
aimed for the recovery and preservation of the ideal text. Rather than
pursue recovery, these textual scholars explore new ways of reading
our textual inheritance that creates new possibilities for discovery
and speculation. Their methodology opens a space for key ideas in
queer theory about how to work within (and resist) the constraints of
language as a significatory system. This is about working within a
system to transcend the determining structure of that system.

practices that tells a story of textual scholarship. Textual
scholarship is the study, annotation, and editing of textual
materials, like manuscripts and books. Within textual scholarship,
textual criticism focuses specifically on identifying and analyzing
variants of manuscripts and books with the purpose of selecting an
ideal witness as the basis for a critical edition. As they further
idealize the value of authorial intention, theories of textual
criticism increasingly delimit the purpose and purview of the
editor. The history of textual criticism thus presents an arc, which
first tends toward I call the conservative or restorative and then,
with the advent of digital technology, the productive. With the
popularization of digital tools, editing becomes less about restoring
or correcting a text, and more about finding ways to open up the way
that a text is read and interpreted. My purpose here is to carve a
critique that emphasizes how the <i>creative</i> capacity functions within
textual editing paradigm. My reading will therefore look to ways that
editorial pracitices have opened up a space for the editor's role as a
content creator rather than recoverer or preserver.
</p>

<p>
The conservatism of textual editing begins with Ronald B. McKerrow,
leading twentieth-century Shakespearean scholar. McKerrow proposed an
influential model for "copy-text" editing, which bases the text (the
"copy-text") on an early witness that most closely resembles the
author's original intention. The editor defers to this text for
editing, favoring the earliest copy-text to settle differences among
variants. However, this approach created its own resistance among
textual scholars, who decried the "the tyranny of the copy-text."
While maintaining reliance on an early copy-text for accidentals
elements like punctuation and spelling, the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle
method of textual criticsm empowers editors to judge between numerous
witnesses the text's more substantive elements<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>. The resulting
critical edition is eclectic, drawing from multiple sources and
depending heavily on the editor's judgment to determine authorial
intention. Fredson Bowers and Thomas Tanselle advanced Walter
W. Greg's influential work, <i>The Rationale of Copy-Text</i>, further
extending the importance of authorial intention and encouraging
editors to make careful and deliberate choices about substantive
elements. Tanselle, in particular, places much value in the editor who
is able to recongize and manage inevitable textual
corruption. According to Tanselle, the physical variant is a vessel
for the text, whose ideal form can only be realized by the editor. He
makes a distinction between "work" and "text":
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of
it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in
sound waves&#x2026; [In fact,] its medium is neither visual nor
auditory. The medium of literature is the words (whether already
existent or newly created) of a language; and arrangements of words
according to the syntax of some language (along with such aids to
their interpretation as pauses or punctuation) can exist in the mind,
whether or not they are reported by voice or in writing. Tanselle
16-17
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tanselle explains that physical act of inscription involves tools that
ultimately corrupt the pure ideas or intentions of the
writer. Therefore, every writer needs an editor that can help her
realize the ideal form of the text on paper. The editor, as someone
who is sufficiently distant from the creation and transcription of the
text, can objectively intimate its true intention. Therefore, the text
closest to the author’s intention is one scrupulously edited by a
textual scholar. Put another way, every author requires a thorough and
knowledgeable editor in order to most closely realize his intentions
on the page.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of the 20th century, textual critics like Jerome McGann
and Donald F. McKenzie take another perspective on the effect of
inscription and tools on the textual material. McGann explores how
editorial practices, rather than aim for some ideal authorial version
of a text, might open up the ways that a text might be interpreted. He
builds off McKenzie's ideas about the influence of the social in
textual criticism. McKenzie's groundbreaking work, <i>Bibliography and
the Sociology of Texts</i> (1999), studies how the materiality of texts,
includes sound and electronic media, takes on new forms and meanings
in in their reprinting and reproduction. McKenzie traces this
distribution, what he calls the "sociology" of texts, by examining the
social context that produced each witness, pointing out that "Every
society rewrites its past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if
they have any continuing life at all, at some point every printer
redesigns them” (25). Because the book is never a single object, but a
product of a number of human agencies and mechanical techniques that
are historically situated, no witness, regardless of scrupulous
editing by the critic, can represent an "ideal" version. McGann takes
these ideas and applies them to a digital editing environment, to
explore how electronic media might present the different variants of a
text. He explains that, because textual criticism in print format is
limited to linear and two dimensional form of the codex, this
criticism is limited to the same form as its object of
study. Paper-based editions, according to McGann’s experience, are
clunky and inadequate, and newer editions often “feed upon and develop
from [their] own blindness and incapacities” (McGann 2001, 81). By
contrast, digital editions can be designed for complex, reflexive, and
ongoing interactions between reader and text. Indeed, “[a]n edition is
conceivable that might undertake as an essential part of its work a
regular and disciplined analysis and critique of itself” (McGann 2001,
81). McGann explains that changing one’s view of the original
materials through the process of building the edition calls its
original purpose into question. McGann points out that his work on the
digital <i>Rossetti Archive</i> brought him to repeatedly reconsider his
earlier conception and goals, asserting that the archive "seemed more
and more an instrument for imagining what we didn’t know” (2001,
82). 
</p>

<p>
Like books, digital media is also limited, but it holds potential for
the way it displays information. The technical experience of editing
electronic texts encourages the speculation on new potentialities
about its presentation. McGann introduces the term “quantum poetics”
to indicate the volatile potentiality for meaning contained in every
element of a literary text. He explains that, “Aesthetic space is
organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements
making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even reverse
themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete quantum
levels” (McGann 2001, 183). The meaning of particular words in a
literary text depends upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent
readings and pathways through that text, to the significance of
immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces, all of which
the reader can only process a limited amount. In its potentiality,
McGann asserts, “Every page, even a blank page&#x2026; is n-dimensional”
(2001, 184). Accordingly, digital tools could expose literature’s
inherent potentialities by carving new paths across familiar texts. In
this way, McGann argues for tools that facilitate tactile and
intuitive engagements of texts within an environment that opens itself
up to multiple dimensions of reading.
</p>

<p>
This radical potentiality of a text's quantum poetics is a result of
the limitation of digital media, which creates a tranformation upon
literary material into a new form. McGann's work thus takes the
limitations of computation&#x2013;the fixing and disambiguation of data&#x2013;and
turns it into a vehicle for analyzing literary material. He, along
with Lisa Samuels, describe literary interpretation as performance, or
what they call "deformance." Deformance works by estranging the reader
from her familiarity of the text, and relies on the the volitality of
meaning of particular words that depend upon a multitude of factors,
from antecedent readings and pathways through that text, to the
significance of immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces,
all of which the reader can only process a limited amount. A
"deformative criticism" therefore distorts, disorders, or re-assembles
literary texts to discover new insights about its formal significance
and meaning. McGann and Samuels offer the example of reading a poem
backward, where “the critical and interpretive question is not 'What
does the poem mean?' but 'How do we release or expose this poem’s
possibilities for meaning?'" (2001, 108).

I now turn to the work of Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement, both of
whom have deep investments with traditions of textual scholarship,
particularly the scholarship of Jerome McGann, that has influenced
early experiments with digital humanities in English
departments. Although their approaches vary in their specific topics,
methods, and results, they are connected in an investment for, in the
words of McGann, "imagining what we don't know" (82).
</p>

<p>
Building off the humanistic approaches in textual scholarship and
bibliography, Bode reframes literary analysis as performative. Bode
incorporates insights from Karen Barad's feminist scientific
methodology to argue against representationalism, or "the idea that a
knowing human agent symbolically expresses – or represents – some
thing-in-the-world (that thing is unchanged by that expression, and
that expression is more available or apprehensible to the subject than
the thing itself) ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 2). Barad's work
intervenes in theoretical physics to argue how the researcher is
always implicated in the object of study, and she proposes a theory of
"agential realism," where objects in the world do not precede their
interaction, but rather, 'objects' emerge through particular
"intra-actions" (Barad 58). Bode brings Barad's point about the
assumption of representation from physics to computational modelling,
where she explains that "entities don’t pre-exist engagements but are
generated in an ongoing or emergent way, by those intra-actions"
("Data Beyond Represenation" par. 2). For Bode, what statisticians
value as “representativeness” or “reproducibility” isn’t as important
(within a humanities context) as the materiality of the
apparatus. Rather than attempt to secure a factual or objective status
of the data, we should double down on the material processes of using
our tools. Accordingly, Bode suggests that we approach literary
databases in performative terms, taking a self-conscious appraisal of
the tools of analysis, as "effects of material-semiotic engagements"
("Data Beyond Representation" par. 15).
</p>

<p>
In troubling the subject/object boundary, examining "how&#x2026; we
inscribe the boundaries we often presume to represent," Bode offers an
example with her current project, <i>Reading at the Interface</i>, which
explores the ways that Australian literature has been characterized by
various "paratexts," or "writings about literature."  ("Data Beyond
Representation par 11.) The project explores paratexts across various
platforms, including academic journals, newspapers, <i>Goodreads</i>, and
<i>Librarything</i>, to see how they have represented the boundary of
"Australian Literature." Bode looks at how the process of data
collection makes a distinction between the main text and the
"paratext," or the metadata like title, author, and publication
information of the text. She is interested in how her inquiry
literally creates boundaries of what we understand to be "text" and
"paratext" in Australian literature. This activity indicates, for
Bode, how the researcher is intevening with the object of
analysis. Bode that she's "not interested in representing discussion
of “Australian literature” on Goodreads so much as in materialising
that platform in ways that cannot be separated from [her] categories
of analysis" ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 19). Her research
finds that an attention to the "apparatus," or the instrument of
analysis, is crucial in exploring the performative aspects of
inquiry. Drawing from a physics understanding, where "an apparatus is
a specific material configuration, including of physicists, wherein
certain properties become determinate, while others are excluded,"
Bode applies the figure of the apparatus to literary databases (Bode
"Data Beyond Representation, par. 24). Instead of looking at what is
being reproduced, she urges literary researchers to look at how human
engagement has entangled with and created the object of analysis.

Tanya Clement's work with sound incorporates praxis, visualization,
embodiment, and play toward a theory of performantive criticism. She
uses figures and methods from audio analysis to reconsider the ways we
approach digitized text. In a project on text visualization, she puts
forth a theory of “play,” in which the critic "performs" the work,
much like the way that musicians interpret a musical score. She uses
the audio analysis tool "ProseVis" to visualize the prosodic elements
of Gertrude Stein's poetry, which creates dynamic spaces for the
reader to interact with the visualization. Using ProseVis, the reader
can navigate through the visualizations and manipulate the metrics for
analysis. Clement makes the analogy between musical scores and
quantitative visualizations to emphasize how both "create another
level of abstraction with which the interpreter engages" ("Distant
Listening par. 7). Clement points out that a musical score "is read,
but it is also meant to be played, to be spatialized in time and
embodied by voices (or instruments) within a certain physical and
hermeneutical context" ("Distant Listening" par. 10). She argues that
the same is true for visualizations of text: "One 'reads' a
visualization, but to 'play' the visualisation is to engage the
spatialized interpretation of that visualisation as an embodied reader
in a situated context within a specific hermeneutical framework
("Distant Listening" par. 10). The multiple levels of abstraction for
containing the "work" of the text multiply the levels of engagement
with that text. Clement's research takes this key finding from textual
scholarship and applies it to the critical process.
</p>

<p>
The unique affordance of digital environments, according to McGann,
Bode and Clement, is that they allow for numerable interventions upon
the textual object. Like a musical score, which "point[s] toward many
possible interpretive 'results' or readings," visualizaions can
provide a starting ground for different pathways of analysis ("Distant
Listening" par. 12). Human attention spans, rather than represent the
hurdle for computational methods to overcome, offer an opportunity for
re-imagining analysis as a process of deforming what we pay attention
to. The emphasis shifts from viewing text as something stable and
self-evident to something dynamic and subject to different
readings. As McGann speculates, engaging with texts on a computer
could be as intimate a process as engaging with them on paper. We
might use digital tools as “prosthetic extension of that demand for
critical reflection,” with which the reader is able to feel her way
through the text (18).

Distant reading can evolve by borrowing from key findings from queer
theory that allow it to embrace the performative/productive aspects of
quantification. In particular, Butler's idea of gender performativity
coheres with deformative reading. Butler describes performativity as a
repetative activity, constrained by regulatory norms, which produces
subjects. Although performativity regulates subjects toward
heteronormative practices, it can also be coopted into subversion. In
the process of repetition, subjects have the possibility of
resignifying meaning by producing it differently. This resignification
allows subjects to work within their limitations to resist dominant
structures while maintaining their own sense of exclusion without
being coopted. In other words, they can be in the system but not of
the system.

<h4 id="org59e4d74"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.2</span> Butler's performative citation, subvert from within</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">
<p>
In her groundbreaking book, <i>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity</i> (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts
contemporary feminist theorizations about sex and gender; namely, that
sex is biological while gender is constructed; and that the gender, as
a construction, is an expression of the subject. According to Butler,
there is no such thing as a stable gender identity, or even a subject
that exists prior to gender expression. Rather, Butler argues that
gender is a performance&#x2013;a series of repeated acts by which the
subject, in the ongoing enactment of gender expression according to
heteronormative regulatory schemas, emerges. Major criticism of this
work resists the idea that both sex and gender are discursively
produced, insisting upon the physicality of the sexed body as a basis
of identity. In <i>Bodies That Matter</i> (1995), Butler responds to this
criticism by delineating the process of performativity, where what is
experienced as the physical body, its boundaries and its sexuality,
only materialize through the repetition or “citation” of cultural
norms. Her concept of "citation" emphasizes the iterability of the
performative practice, whereby each action "cites" or implicitly
signals an authorizing norm. According to Butler, performance consists
of this habit of citation, the ongoing process of submitting behavior
to a regulatory norm. Butler makes the general argument that body’s
materiality is discursive, that the “sexed body” is a residue or
"sentimentation" that emerges from the signification and
re-signification of whatever social power or understanding about sex.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Bodies that Matter</i>, Butler's central concern is to explore how
language and the body engage. She approaches this concern by
identifying the issue with representation: "Can language simply refer
to materiality, or is language also the very condition under which
materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Specifically, Butler wonders
whether language can indicate a body that has not yet been imbued with
meaning, a body "prior to signification" (6). She finds that language
cannot&#x2013;for to refer to the body, language must first posit that body,
and in the positing, it assumes meaning. Therefore, the signification
of the body actually creates the body: "This signification produces as
an <i>effect</i> of its own procedure the very body that it nevertheless
and simultaneously claims to discover as that which <i>precedes</i> its own
action" (6). Butler thus claims that language works to <i>produce</i>
signification, rather than reflect a prior reality: "the mimetic or
representational status of language, which claims that signs follow
bodies as their necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the
contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue
performative" (6). Language cannot simply point to a reality, for in
the act of pointing, language actually produces that reality. So, in
the process of citation, which is the ongoing re-signification that
appeals to regulatory norms, subjects are always interpellated by a
discourse prior to their citing it: they cannot speak outside the
power that structures speech. However, in settling the issue of
language and representation, Butler isolates a productive quality of
language, which will be central to the ways that language offers a way
out of the significatory circle.
</p>

<p>
Amid this regulatory structure, however, lies the possibility of
resignifying sex/gender. Butler insists that resignification of these
citations is the way out of this significatory circle. Butler asks,
"What would it mean to cite a law to produce it differently, to 'cite'
the law in order to reiterate and coopt its power?" (xxiii). Because
language transcends a representative function, because it has the
ability to <i>produce</i> meaning, language can be resignified toward
subversive usages. Butler offers an example in the resignification of
the term "queer," which has been transformed from a term of abjection
to one of empowerment. She explains that, every time an identification
is made, so is a repudiation, and "this disavowed abjection will
threaten to expose the self-grounding presumptions of the sexed
subject" (3). In identifying with heterosexuality, one repudiates
homosexuality, and homosexuality, in turn, remains a threat to the
identification. Butler proposes that one marshall this repudiation as
a resource in resignification: "The task will be to consider this
threat and disruption&#x2026; as a critical resource in the struggle to
articulate the very terms of symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility"
(3). She explains that one recognizes this resignification in the word
“queer” which has been re-appropriated from signifying abjectness to
defiance. The term "queer," in its public assertion, "enacts
performativity as citationality for the purposes of resignifying the
abjection of homosexuality into defiance and legitimacy"
(xxviii). Each time the term is used, it draws from the domain of
abjection, the repudiation, in a way that re-signifies because it
fails to repeat the meaning loyally, because it signifies that meaning
differently. Repetition of the term to re-signify identification, to
the point where it loses its power. This is especially evident in
drag, where "the refusal of the law might be produced in the form of
the parodic inhabiting of conformity that subtly calls into question
the legitimacy of the command, a repetition of the law into hyperbole"
(82). For Butler, then, the central problem of being stuck in
performance is also the solution. Butler takes on language as
something that can be productive, that can resignify meaning, as the
option available to those who are trapped within the signification
system.
</p>

<p>
An exploration of Luce Irigaray writing style demonstrates how this
process of resignification can take place in language. According to
Butler, Irigaray's main task is to explore what has been excluded by
philosophy, which is the feminine. Irigaray uses the concept of
phallogocentrism, or that man, symbolized by the phallus, is the
center and focus of knowledge, as a lens for reading Plato and
Aristotle's discussion of form/matter or bodies/souls
binaries. Irigaray demonstrates how these binaries, which take the
category of "woman," associated with "matter" (materiality, the
mother) and set it subordinate to male "form" (mastering rationality)
actually erase the possibility of representing woman at all. In fact,
the binary that claims to represent the feminine as the subordinated
term in masculine/feminine binaries, actually "produces the feminine
as that which must be excluded for that economy to operate"
(10). Because "binary oppositions are formulated through the exclusion
of a field of disruptive possibilities"(10), the feminine is
"domesticated" (13). The nonfigured feminine remains excessive,
outside the terms of the binary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One cannot interpret the philosophical relation to the feminine
through the figures that philosophy provides, but, rather, she argues,
through siting the feminine as the unspeakable condition of
figuration, as that which, in fact, can never be figured within the
terms of philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is
its enabling condition. 12
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What Butler calls the <i>excessive</i> feminine is excluded, or cast out,
as "the necessary outside," which allows the <i>specular</i> feminine to
take its place in the binary. According to Butler, we cannot know what
the feminine consists of without subscribing it to
phallogocentrism. If the feminine is outside the system, and cannot be
figured, how can it be known? Butler aptly questions, "For how can one
read a text for what does <i>not</i> appear within its own terms, but which
nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own
legibility?" (11). For Butler, this is the key question&#x2013;how do we
work with what we are given to express what is not there, what is
refused by the system of the visible?
</p>

<p>
The answer is through repetition and reworking&#x2013;resignification
through performative citation. Butler explains that Irigaray achieves
this resignification by miming language: "she mimes philosophy&#x2026; and,
in the mime, takes on a language that effectively cannot belong to
her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use citation as a strategy of
repeating what Plato says with the goal of undermining his authority:
"She cites Plato again and again, but the citations expose precisely
what is excluded from them, and seek to show and to reintroduce the
excluded into the system itself" (18). Through repetition, Irigaray
displaces the logic of phallogocentrism, introducing something
external to the system while remaining within its terminology. Butler
affirms that "Her miming has the effect of repeating the origin only
to displace that origin as an origin" (18). Her repetition is a way of
infiltrating the logic of phallogocentrism on its own terms. Butler
herself mimes what might have been Irigaray's internal monologue:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Deception through resemblance; insubordination through subservience;
displacement through repetition&#x2013;these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism.
</p>

<p>
For Butler and Irigaray, however, "radical and inclusive
representability is not precisely the goal" (25). Remaining <i>outside</i>
the logic of phallogocentrism is necessary for preserving the content
of the excluded feminine from being coopted into that logic. Butler,
in particular, hopes for a queer subjectivity that can never be
defined, and like the term "queer," for it "to remain that which is,
in the present, never fully owned, but always and only redeployed,
twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and
expanding political purposes" (173). Through performative citation,
Butler intends to preserve that which is excluded or unintelligible as
a resource for continual resignification, as "the point of departure
for a set of historical reflections and futural imaginings"
(173). For, Butler explains that, "to bring in every marginal and
excluded position within a given discourse is to claim that a singular
discourse meets its limits nowhere, that it can and will domesticate
all signs of difference" (25). Rather than aim for inclusion, one
ought to position the "necessary outside" as a target that is beyond
reach, as a fount for future subversions. This positioning allows us
to harness opacity and unintelligibility as a resource for resisting
the violence of this exclusion, using unrepresentability as a tool for
disruption. Only this language of performative citation can illuminate
the structure of the signifying power without also giving that power
the tool to fight that which is questioning its authority. Butler
explains that, "If there is a violence necessary to the language of
politics, then the risk of that violation might well be followed by
another in which we begin, without ending, without mastering, to
own—-and yet never fully to own—-the exclusions by which we proceed."
(25).

In the section on reproducibility, I discuss how Underwood's analysis
on gender differences reproduces his assumptions about gender dynamics
as oppositional, as he readily admits: "this chapter has discovered
stable 'structural positions' only because it explores gender, for the
most part, as a binary opposition" (<i>Distant Horizons</i> 140). The the
binary structure reproduces itself from the initial assumptions to the
resutl. Like the fantasy of the falsifiable, the romance of
reproducibility arises from a desire to find coherence across literary
history, and thus aims for a method that can do so by abstracting text
as data to surface connections between them. Because reproducibility
aims for what Underwood describes as a "simple picture," it collapses
or flattens the complexity of data into workable units ("Machine
Learning" 98). What are the major trends of literary style across
time? How can our analytical models take in even more data, and
multiple perspectives, and process it into a legible visualizations?
Such questions tend to reproduce their own assumptions in the
output. The issue then becomes, how can we might move beyond
reproducing assumptions in our analysis
</p>

<p>
One answer is to shift the objective of analysis from the the
reproducible to the speculative. My intervention lies in teasing out
how existing paradigms for analyzing literary data and power
structures might combine to create a new method for text analyis. This
new method grapples with quantification that reduces or flattens data
by harnessing this reduction toward speculative ends. First, the field
of Textual Scholarship, which explores how electronic environments
faciliate the continued study of literary materials, offers Deformance
as an analytical method. This method attends to the ways that digital
environments for editorial scholarship transform the object of study
to surface new material for analysis. Second, the field of Queer
Studies offers the theory of Performativity, which is not a critical
method of analysis, but a paradigm for understanding how subjects
navigate compulsory significatory systems. The theory of Performance
posits that subjectivity emerges by subscribing to&#x2013;or
"citing"&#x2013;regulatory norms of behavior, like gender roles, and also
proposes that citational practices open the possibility for subversion
to norms through resignification. Despite their differences, both
deformance and performance rely on the ability for language to
resignifiy meaning through deconstruction and iterability. Both pay
attention to the productive qualities of language, which can be
redeployed toward creativity, rather than perpetuate "representations"
which obscure their significatory power by miming some prior citation.
</p>

<p>
The way that Bode describes her critical approach mirrors Butler's
explanation of the performative. Bode is drawing a distinction between
two approaches for literary criticism, two options for engaging with
literary material and phenomena. The first is "representationalist,"
in which data represents or expresses real objects and subjects in the
world. The second approach understands data "as part of the ongoing
materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events always arising
from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured" (Bode
"Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to Performative
Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a representationalist
approach toward language and materiality, in which language can
<i>refer</i> to materiality as something that is prior, against the
performative approach, by which language works through repetition to
signify and resignify meaning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The alignment here between Bode and Butler indicates an intersection
between queer and digital processes, which center on the role of
language and data in conveying meaning. There is something
fundamentally productive about these phenomena, and not in the way
that they purport to represent some real quality or object in the
world. Rather, the productive aspect has to do with how they iterate
their material over and again in ways that are fundamentally creative.

linked to a fiction of the ego as master of circumstance&#x2014;is derived
from the impossibility of choice… Paris is Burning might be understood

Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter
five, a spike that is surrounded with a dearth of don'ts. This
explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

<p>
&#x2013;&gt; reproducing something perfectly overlooks the ways that all
digital objects are unique, differentiated. Theory of textual
criticism which shows how ther are more interesting things to do then
create a digital "copy texte". 
</p>

<p>
This notion extends to digital humanist practitioners. 
</p>

<p>
they call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses" while maintaining that reproduction is
the highest value. They argue to "texture the humanities", pointing
out that much of DH prioritizes the visual over other senses &#x2013;
"privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible"
(74). Rightly so, they argue, “The textured DH we call for here
acknowledges that we cannot study knowledge only abstractly, apart
from the senses, and that we cannot study literature, art, and history
without including the history of embodied experiences” (74-75).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“Touch This Page! uses 3-D printed facsimiles of raised-letter text
to inspire reflection on the assumptions most people make about
which senses are involved in reading” (82).</li>
</ul>

<p>
But they elide the one interesting trajectory when they place
reproduction over remediation/deformance. They state their aims: “to
expand the sensory accessibility of archives for all users and to do
so through the digital reproduction&#x2014;rather than the translation&#x2014;of
tactile knowledge” (76). Case example of the perfect reproduction:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A scenario where “users&#x2026; can download a visual copy with</li>
</ul>
<p>
descriptive data, engage with the text in virtual reality, and create
their own textured facsimile. This technology once more makes possible
the tactile reading experiences for which this volume was designed and
promises library patrons a richer engagement with touch than most
archives can currently provide&#x2014;even in person (85-86). 
</p>

<p>
The use case scenario makes the assumption that a reproduction is the
ideal form of textuality, despite their asserted aims for "diversity
of embodied experiences":
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“we must avoid tilting after the fiction of some ideal digital
surrogate&#x2014;like a virtual reality system that would flawlessly
mimic original objects&#x2014;lest we become digital Pierre Menards,
expending extensive energy to improve our reproductions to discover,
at last, that only the original perfects represents itself… Instead,
we envision in our tactile futures multiple strategies that could
not only open up access to varied experiences&#x2014;past and
present&#x2014;but also diversity the ways embodied experiences structure
our digital worlds” (86).</li>
<li>in order to open up “multiple strategies” and diversity embodied
experiences, we need a theory of text that is capacious enough to
accept variation and transmediation.</li>
<li>This argument overlooks deformance is a solution: the ways that
creating new texts, paratexts, creates new objects of knowledge. It
overlooks the performative, ala McGann, Clement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this view, digital becomes a means of optimization, efficiency,
total knowledge and understanding.

Postcritical Reading…  “in this sense, is not just a cognitive

<p>
Felski: At stake is our receptivity: “to allow ourselves to be marked,
struck, impressed by what we read” (Felski 12). 
</p>

<p>
"the reader-text connection becomes part of a network rather than a
self-enclosed dyad— yet a connection that remains vital to literary
studies, especially in the classroom. Reading, in this light, is a
matter of attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging
links between things that were previously unconnected. It is not a
question of plumbing depths or tracing surfaces… Interpretation
becomes a coproduction between actors that brings new things to light
rather than an endless rumination on a text’s hidden meanings or
representational failures” (Felski 174)
</p>

<p>
Surface reading challenges that search for absence by compelling a
reader to stay with what the text says and how it says it rather than
moving ahead to probe how it reflects and refracts larger cultural
patterns. This critique reifies aesthetic objects and suggests that
literary critics should embrace the literary.

<p>
Digital media create an illusion of immateriality&#x2014;screen
essentialism. We should approach materiality on two levels, the formal
and forensic, to counter misunderstandings and occlusions of new
media. Electronic texts are not ephemeral or homogenous, they are
inscribed and made of unique traces.

<p>
The way that media works in the 21st century both marginalizes and
expands human perception. Things we have no awareness of are out there
feeling for us. We have an expanded perceptual reach, but our
sensations are indirect. This puts consciousness in an anticipatory
mode, always future oriented, focusing on what is nearly emergent&#x2014;
“feed forward”.

Using TEI to teach close reading finds that one can approach it to
engage individualized readings&#x2014;marking moments of textual
instability rather than formal aspects. Given that the tool is
flexible enough, we do not have to agree on a schema, standardize a
schema, in order to use the tool to engage the incommensurable.
