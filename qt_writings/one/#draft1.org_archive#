In a controversial peice about text analysis, Nan Z. Da critiques
Computational Literary Studies (CLS) for its irrelevance to literary
criticism. Da explains that results from quantification do one of two
things: they either affirm what is already obvious or they present
conclusions that are inaccurate. Of her many gripes with quantitative
methods, which include "technical problems, logical fallacies, and
conceptual flaws," her central concern is the fundamental "mismatch"
of scientific methods to humanistic inquiry, both of which have
opposing "natures" (601). Meant for reading in abundance, tradign
"speed for accuracy, and coverage for nuance," Quantitativ methods are
inappropriately applied to literary interpretation (620). According to
Da, "we must use them in accordance with their true functions” (620).

One point in Da's essay crystallizes her ultimately conservative
investment that aligns her with theorists who have vastly different
methods and perspectives. Here she establishes the criterion of
reproducibility, which suggests an objective at odds with humanistic
endeavor. To verify the results of a Topic Modelling experiment, Da
attempting to replicate the model on her own machine. Because the
reproduction fails, she denigrates the whole process: "if the method
were effective, someone with comparable training should be able to use
the same parameters to get basically the same results"
(628-629). However, "topic modeling is like a kaleidoscope that turns
out something entirely different with the slightest tweaking”
(629). Her emphasis on the “reproducible” in CLS extends one of
distant reading early champion's originating call for a “falsifiable
criticism”: both advocate for a methodology that is as reliable and
verifiable as the social sciences[fn:5]. The interesting detail in her
critique is the insinuation in /reproducible/ that somehow analysis is
something that can exist outside of human performance/activity/error.
