* "'A Melon, an Emerald, a Fox in the Snow': Quantifying Gender in Virginia Woolf's /Orlando: A Biography/"

** /ABSTRACT/

This chapter explores how the quantitative analysis of gender in text
might leverage gender theory toward a new methodology. It explores an
experimental approach that deconstructs gender binaries by drawing
connections between computer programming and gender theory. First, it
delves into the python programming language, focusing on the principle
of iteration that drives cleaning and regularizing tasks, as well as
the transformation of words into numerical representations for
quantitative processing, with the goal of bringing out the iterative
quality of working with python code. It then moves to Judith Butler’s
concept of gender performativity, which posits how gender expression
might subvert traditional social structures through repeatedly
“performing” gender constraints in ways that deviate from the
norm. Taking this shared quality of iteration between python and
gender, it proposes a text analysis methodology that iterates through
distant and close reading. It then concludes by considering the
limitations of this method, which poses gender as a discursive
phenomenon, and its place within a larger trajectory of Gender Studies
since Butler's text inaugurating the field.

** /CHAPTER/

The novel /Orlando: A Biography/ (1928), by Virginia Woolf, famously
opens with an assertive gender designation followed by an immediate
qualification: “He--for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the
fashion of the time did something to disguise it—-was in the act of
slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters” (11). When
performing quantitative text analysis on this text, a fictional
biography of a 16th-century English nobleman who undergoes a sex
change, the standard tasks of “pre-processing” text evacuate the ways
that gender is complicated in this sentence. In order to
computationally analyze a text, which involves calculating and
visualizing textual patterns, the text must first be transformed into
a computable format.[fn:1] This task of pre-processing (also called
“cleaning” or “normalizing”) strips the original text of capitalized
words, punctuation, “stop words” (such as articles and prepositions),
and inflections in word endings, all of which are deemed to be
semantically minor, in order to make the text amenable to quantitative
analysis. Afterward, the following list of computable words, or
“tokens,” remain in the first sentence:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
‘could’, ‘doubt’, ‘sex’, ‘though’, ‘fashion’, ‘time’, ‘something’,
‘disguise’, ‘act’, ‘slicing’, ‘head’, ‘moor’, ‘swung’, ‘rafter’.
#+END_QUOTE
Cleaning this text not only strips it of its pronouns, including the
gender assertion in the first word, “He.” It also cuts the em dash
immediately following this "He," which signals the entrance of a
narrator that layers this assertion with conspicuous certitude: "—for
there could be no doubt of his sex…."

This chapter examines how quantitative text analysis works with
gender, using Woolf's /Orlando/ as a test case. It explores an
experimental approach that deconstructs gender binaries by drawing
connections between computer programming and gender theory. This
analysis contrasts the principle /iteration/, central to both text
analysis and gender theory, with current /reproducible/ methods in
quantitative analysis. I propose a text analysis methodology that
iterates through distant and close reading of the terms "woman" and
"man" in /Orlando/. I then conclude by considering the limitations of
this method, which poses gender as a discursive phenomenon, and its
place within a larger trajectory of Gender Studies.

** /The Fantasy of the Falsifiable/
Because computers can process hundreds of texts at a time, "reading"
at much faster rates than humans, they attract critics like Franco
Moretti, Matthew Jockers, Ted Underwood, among others, who pose
ambitious questions about literary history.  Moretti, for example,
explains that the process of quantification reduces the complexity of
textuality in ways that open the potential for analysis: "fewer
elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection"
(/Graphs/ 1). This approach toward computation represents what I call
the "fantasy of the falsifiable." Leaving aside critiques of Moretti,
particularly in light of the credible allegations of harrasment and
assault by graduate students (see Lauren F. Klein, "Distant Reading
After Moretti"),[fn:2] I want to focus on Moretti's early essay "The
Soul and the Harpy" (1983), which lays out the reasoning behind
developing a new methodological approach for literary criticism.
Moretti in this essay betrays a deep suspicion about the analytical
practices of the contemporary literary criticism that "multiplyi[es],
rather than reduc[es], the obstacles every social science encounters
when it tries to give itself a testable foundation," and the literary
critic that he likens the literary critic to a kind of Narcissus,
"whose only pleasure lay in contemplating his own reflection" ("Soul"
22, 14). Moretti proposes an alternative methodology that grounds the
critical process on a more solid foundation, a "falsifiable criticism"
that can "test" literary interpretations ("Soul" 21). /Falsifiable/
here means verifiable--ensuring the "hypothesis" can be meaningfully
tested--and pursues answers that are "coherent, univocal, and
complete" ("Soul" 21). The goal, according to Moretti, is to reach
irrefutable conclusions: "The day criticism gives up the battle cry
'it is possible to interpret this element in the following way', to
replace it with the much more prosaic 'the following interpretation is
impossible for such and such a reason', it will have taken a huge step
forward on the road of methodological solidity" ("Soul" 22).

As Moretti's falsifiable criticism eventually grows into "distant
reading," he streamlines his critical method into a recursive process
of posing hypotheses, assembling data, making inferences, and
sometimes, reframing the original hypotheses. In one project that
studies the effect of market forces on book titles from 1740-1850,
Moretti finds an interesting relationship between the size of the
market and the length of titles: "As the market expands, titles
contract; as they do that, they learn to compress meaning" (204). When
explaining his process, his word choice diminishes the interpretive
moves he makes throughout his critical analysis:
#+begin_quote
first, I describe a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles,
and /try to explain/ its causes; next, I /suggest/ how a new type of
title that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected
of novels; and finally, I /make a little attempt/ at quantitative
stylistics... (181-2; emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
As Stephen Ramsay points out, Moretti tends to present his conclusions
as an objective description of reality portrayed through his graphs
and other visualizations. It is as if "data is presented to us... not
as something that is also in need of interpretation" (Ramsay 5).

Ironically, the faith in falsifiable criticism gets its strongest
expression in a famous detraction by Nan Z. Da, who argues that
quantitative methods, which trade "speed for accuracy, and coverage
for nuance," reveal a "fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical
tools that are used and the objects to which they are applied," (620,
601). Da emphasizes her point with an experiment in "Topic Modeling,"
a Machine Learning method that generates a number of "topics," or
keywords, from large collections of text. Da attempts to verify the
results of a topic modelling experiment by replicating the process on
her own computer, but fails to produce the same results, leading her
to conclude that the method is ineffective. However, as Ben Schmidt
explains, Da in fact uses different parameters and software to run her
experiments, which explains the differences in her
results. Furthermore, he points out that, "Far /more/ than anyone I’ve
seen in any humanities article, she asserts that scientists do
something arcane, powerful, and true.[fn:3] Despite their vastly
different views on the role of quantitative methods for studying
literature, Da and Moretti agree that these methods ought to provide
results that are, at the very least, reproducible.

With an awareness about the role of interpretation quantitative
methods, Ted Underwood explores what he calls "perspectival models" of
literary data. Underwood explains that "Machine learning algorithms
are actually bad at being objective and rather good at absorbing human
perspectives implicit in the evidence used to train them" ("Machine
Learning and Human Perspective" 92). First, Underwood trains a machine
learning algorithm with sample data, such as descriptions of
characters tagged with gender identities. Then, this data feedsf into
the algorithm, which "learns" what words are typically associated with
women and which words are typically associated with men. At the end of
this training process, the resulting model can predict the gender of
characters in new text. Underwood calls this approach as "perspectival
modelling," because it represents a single, rather than objective or
universal, perspective of the data. Dan Sinykin explains that this
perspectival method enables Underwood "to leverag[e] the human
prejudices built into modeling toward humanistic ends" (par. 4). In
one project, Underwood uses a logistic regression algorithm to
calculate and visualize the terms typically associated with each
gender in books by men and books by women (See fig. 1). Here, each
axis represents a different perspective on gender. The verticle axis
visualizes words by women, and the horizontal by men, with positive
numbers signifying overrepresentation of certain words. The terms on
the left side of the graph describe men, with the top-left corner and
bottom-left corner denoting books by male and female authors,
respectively. The terms on the right side of the graph describe women,
with the top-right corner and bottom-right corner denoting books by
female and male authors, respectively. Underwood explains that,
"Instead of trying to define gender, this diagram models a contrast
between two perspectives on the topic... I needed a simple picture,
frankly, in order to explain how a quantitative model can be said to
represent a perspective" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
98).

[[./img/Underwood.png]]
Fig. 1: Underwoods logistic regression model. 

Underwood's methodology reinscribes the same binary that it attempts
to historicize. Here, he uses uses logistic regression analysis, an
entry-level machine learning algorithm that makes predictions on a
scale from 0 to 1. The problem is that this probablistic computation
reifies gender as either/or, in other words, as a binary opposition,
which Underwood admits himself when he says that "gender theorists
will be frustrated by the binary structure of the diagram" ("Machine
Learning" 98). Here, the concept of femininity is deliberately
consolidated and computed against that of masculinity, which is
precisely the purpose of a binary classification algorithm that
collapses all possible answers between a scale of yes/no. Feeding
gender terms into such an algorithm effectively imposes a binary
structure onto these terms.

In my view, such an approach undershoots the potential of quantitative
methods for studying gender. The goal of attaining some kind of
overarching knowledge about literary history, whether that be a
"distant horizon," or "the great unread," side-steps some of the more
novel insights that computation enables. Distant reading methods might
instead harness what Ramsay describes as "the objectivity of the
machine," to destabilize the binary (x).[fn:4] Resisting the
temptations of falsifiable criticism, work by critics like Susan
Brown, Laura Mandell, Richard Jean So, and Edwin Roland apply distant
reading methods toward deconstructing social categories like gender
and race.[fn:5] Brown and Mandell explain that, "The goal is to
acknowledge the subjective effects of belonging to an identity
constituted historically through oppression without believing that the
identity itself exists independently from historical conditions"
(Mandell and Brown 6). This position places computational methods
within a discursive frame, aligning it with debates from
post-structuralist feminist theory that explore and provoke the
representative capacities of language. The computer becomes a tool for
exploring how language constructs (and can deconstruct) social
categories.

In a critique of distant reading methods, Mandell illustrates how the
study of gender often reifies gender stereotypes, "presenting
conclusions about 'male' and 'female' modes of thinking and writing as
if the M/F terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality,
transparently referential and not discursively constituted"
(par. 5). Mandell's examination marshalls key findings from feminist
theory, drawing from Judith Butler, among others, to assert that
gender is "constructed both by the measurer and the measured"
(par. 38). Computation offers, in Mandell's words, "parallax, multiple
perspectives for viewing a very complex reality” (par. 38). To
deconstruct gender, Mandell turns to genre, another category which
will allow scholars to see the reductive constitution of categories
generally. Here, Mandell uses the popular stylometry measurement,
"Burrow's Delta," which visualizes the "distance" between writing
styles by creating branches (or "deltas") between different texts. She
finds that the stylistic qualities of a female writer, Mary
Wollenstonecraft, shares with those of comparable male writers:
"Wollstonecraft’s sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble
[William] Godwin’s sentimental anti-Jacobin novels... whereas her
essays most resemble [Samuel] Johnson’s writings" (par. 29). Drawing
gender into conversation with genre, Mandell creates categories such
as "'men writing as men,' 'women writing as women,' 'women writing as
men,' 'men writing as women,' 'unspecified (anonymous) writing as
men,'" and so on (par. 35).

Just as quantification can be harnessed to deonstruct the M/F binary,
so it can deconstruct what Edwin Roland and Richard Jean So describe
as "the machine's initial binary understanding of race" (68). Roland
and So deconstruct racial categories by experimenting with an
algorithm that evaluates an author's race based on diction. Analyzing
a large corpora of novels by white and black authors, they find that,
black authors generally display more varied vocabulary than white
authors (66). From this result, they infer that white authorship, as a
category, only coheres against the variance of black
authorship. Whiteness, they explain, /depends/ on the characterization
of blackness.

This quantitative exercise points Roland and So toward a peculiarity
in the results: that the algorithm wrongly categorizes James Baldwin's
novel /Giovanni's Room/ (1956) as being written by a white
author. This misclassification is attributable to a single word,
"appalled," which the computer reads as proof of white
authorsip. Going back to the text, Roland and So discover that this
term occurs only once, in the early scene where the narrator David
describes his strained relationship to his father: "I did not want to
be his buddy. I wanted to be his son. What passed between us as
masculine candor exhausted and /appalled/ me" (my emphasis; Rpt. in So
and Roland 71). Noting the connotations of whiteness in "appalled,"
which has the middle French root, "apalir," meaning "to grow pale," So
and Roland insightfully conclude that this term suggests a relation
between gender and race: "the moment David develops a troubled
relationship to normative masculinity [as] also the moment he becomes
'white'" (71). The computer's misclassification, as they point out,
reinforces this text's notorious elision of explicit references to
race, as critics have observed in the scholarship on this novel,
whereby racial markers are displaced in favor of an implicit
whiteness. Taking the computer's mistake as a starting point, Roland
and So's analysis thus contributes to the ongoing debate about the
complex relationship between gender and race in the novel.

In direct opposition to the "falsifiable" position, computational
error here becomes a starting point for analysis. Because race is a
social construct, and machines only impute meaning that is encoded
into them, Roland and So reason that machines are ideal instruments
for studying the construction of race (60). Furthermore, the machine
error surfaces a yet unexplored aspect related to race, that of
sexuality:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Our reading’s destabilization of the machine’s logic of white and
black arises directly from the novel’s expression of queerness. By
queering the machine’s color line, Baldwin’s novel challenges our
initial classifications of the novels as white or black, which had
necessarily effaced a more sophisticated, intersectional view of
social identity. In their current form, our data and model are not
robust enough to handle this kind of intersectionality. 72
#+END_QUOTE
Like Mandell, So and Roland use computational methods to destabilize,
rather than reify, binary categories like male/female, or
white/black. In this case, a single computational error opens a site
for speculation about how whiteness suggests a troubled understanding
of sexuality, where queerness might articulate with race.

** /Iteration/
Mandell asserts that both gender and genre "are... highly imitatable,"
so that "anyone can adopt gendered modes of behavior, just as anyone
can write in genres stereotypically labeled M/F" (par. 30). While this
interpretation echoes a common misunderstanding of Butler's theory,
gender performativity remains a useful heuristic for quantitative text
analysis. First, the common misreading of Butler's theory is that
gender performativity denotes an act or series of acts that can be
imitated at will. Rather, as Butler emphasizes in her follow up book,
/Bodies that Matter: on the Discursive Limits of Sex/ (1996),
performativity is a compulsory process that precedes and constitutes
subjectivity.[fn:6] It is a mechanism through which the subject can
emerge--"a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and 'acts'
come to appear at all" (/Bodies/ xviii). Butler here makes the
argument for gender as purely discursive, where what is experienced as
the physical body, from sex to sexuality, only materializes through
the repetition of gender norms in which each act signals a prior,
authorizing norm.[fn:7] This thread of discursivity and its
implications within a larger trajectory of Queer Studies is picked up
in this chapter's conclusion.

To better understand performativity as a discursive phenomenon, it is
helpful to situate Butler's work within the context of second-wave
feminism and its deconstruction of gender binaries. Here, Butler draws
from the work of feminist theorist Luce Irigaray, who asserts that
influential Western thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and Freud who have
defined feminity "on the basis of masculine parameters" (Irigaray,
/The Sex Which Is Not One/ 23).[fn:8] Irigaray argues that the
association of "woman" with "matter" (such as "rationality/emotion"
and "mind/body"), and its subordination to to male "form" erases the
possibility of representing woman at all. Rather, this binary
"produces the feminine as that which must be excluded for that economy
to operate" (10). This "domesticated" feminine term contrasts to the
excessive feminine, the "necessary outside" of the domesticated
feminine (which is also its enabling condition), that creates a "field
of disruptive possibilities" (13). However, this "unspeakable" element
cannot be invoked directly without subscribing itself to the ruling
structure (12).[fn:9] Butler asks, "how can one read a text for what
does /not/ appear within its own terms, but which nevertheless
constitutes the illegible conditions of its own legibility?"
(11). This question--how to express what is not there, what is refused
by the system of the visible--leads Butler to her theory of gender
subversion.

For Butler, theorizing subversion begins by positing the origin of
linguistic signification. She wonders, "Can language simply refer to
materiality, or is language also the very condition under which
materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Butler finds that, in order
to refer to a body, language must first assume a body. Therefore, she
reasons, the signification of the body actually creates the body which
it appears to reference: "signification produces as an /effect/ of its
own procedure the very body that it nevertheless and simultaneously
claims to discover as that which /precedes/ its own action" (6). This
reasoning leads Bulter to a major realization: "the mimetic or
representational status of language.... is not mimetic at all. On the
contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue
performative" (6). If language produces the reality that it seems to
merely reference, it means that subjects are always interpellated, and
in fact brought into subjectivity, by a discourse prior to their their
participation in it.

Within this regulatory structure, this significatory circle, lies the
possibility of resistance, the possibility of /resignifying/
meaning. Because language transcends a merely representative function,
because it works to produce meaning, language can be resignified
toward subversive usages by "citing" what Bulter calls a "repudiated"
meaning. Butler offers the famous example in the resignification of
the term "queer," which has been transformed from a term of abjection
to one of empowerment. "Queer" is resignified when it harnesses its
own repudiation, which is an implied but "disavowed abjection [that]
will threaten to expose the self-grounding presumptions of the sexed
subject" (3). Each time that "queer" is used, it draws from this
domain of abjection which is repudiated by heterosexuality. Butler
proposes that one "consider this threat and disruption... as a
critical resource in the struggle to articulate the very terms of
symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility" (3). By citing the repudiated
meaning, the term "queer" "resignifyi[es] the abjection of
homosexuality into defiance and legitimacy" (xxviii).

Here, repetition is key, enabling the introduction of what is external
to the binary into the system. Irigaray achieves this resistance by
"mim[ing] philosophy... and, in the mime, tak[ing] on a language that
effectively cannot belong to her" (12). Irigaray undermines authority
through repetition, by "cit[ing] Plato again and again, but the
citations expose precisely what is excluded from them, and seek to
show and to reintroduce the excluded into the system itself"
(18). Irigaray introduces something external to the system, displacing
the logic of phallogocentrism, while remaining within its
terminology. Butler imagines Irigaray's thought process here:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
#+END_QUOTE
Through repetition, deception emerges from resemblance, and
insubordination through subservience. The key is iteration, a
continual miming of the authorizing norm.

In what follows, I examine how iteration also emerges in the Python
programming language as it is used for text analysis tasks. Here, I
will deconstruct the cleaning and analysis processes to surface the
ways that Python's syntax evokes this quality of iteration.

The Python programming language offers a number of custom librarries,
suchas the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), for common text analysis
tasks that clean, count, and visualize textual patterns. Python
handles text data in the form of words, or ~strings~, contained within
groupings called ~lists~. Then, Python goes through each item in the
list to perform a task. One function for going through lists is known
as the ~for loop~, which repeats a single action to each item, each
~string~, the ~list~. At a very basic level, much of text analysis
consists of looping, or iterating, over bits of text and performing
actions to standardize the text for analysis. Such actions include
tokenizing, cleaning, and regularizing, which help to eliminate pieces
of text that will skew the results of analysis due to their high
frequency and low semantic value. Tokenizing the text means separating
the text into workable units, or ~tokens~, that are easier to clean
and regularize. Once the text is tokenized, it can be stripped of
capital letters, punctuation, and what are called "stop words," which
consist of prepositions, articles, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs,
which are deemed to be semantically minor compared to nouns, verbs,
and adjectives, and adverbs. These tasks of preprosessing text force
words into existing boxes, so to speak, to make them amenable to
analysis. The effect of this preprocessing strips text of the
significance portrayed by capitalized words, rhythms of language in
stop words, inflections in word endings, and so on. This reduction of
text is a necessary trade-off in order to reduce idiosyncracies and to
make meaningful computations on the text. Although the process cannot
be avoided, the researcher should be aware of how certain textual
reductions have the potential to affect meaning.

The first step in cleaning usually involves removing things like
punctuation and capital letters. The following code block loops
through a text, saved here as ~full-text~, to filter out punctuation
and transform any capital letters into lowercase forms:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
normalized = []

for word in full-text:

    if word.isalpha():

        normalized.append(word.lower())

#+END_SOURCE

Here, the loop begins by creating an empty list, ~normalized~, where
words will be dropped after passing the filter. The next line begins
the ~for loop~, which iterates through each word in the ~full-text~
list of words. The third line, an ~if statement~ creates a boolean
condition specifying alphabetic characters (in other words, containing
no numbers or punctuation). If the word fulfills that condition, then
it passes to the fourth line, which will add that word to the
~normalized~ list. At the moment that this word is added to the list,
its letters will be transformed to lowercase format. The final list,
therefore, will only contain alphabetic and lowercased letters. 

The next step is removing stop words. Here, we use another loop,
compressed into one line of code, in a syntax that is called a "list
comprehension."

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
no-stops = [word for word in normalized if word not in stops]
#+END_SOURCE

This expression takes each word in a list, in this case, ~normalized~,
and checks to see if that word is also contained within the list of
stop words in ~stops~. If the word is /not/ a stop word, then it will
be added to a new list, ~no_stops~. Running the first sentence of
/Orlando/ through the loop will return the following list of words:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafters']
#+END_SOURCE

The next (and final) step of cleaning involves stripping the word
inflections to get the root. Here, there are two possibilities, which
differ in how much computational processing each requires. The first
one, called "stemming", simply cuts the endings from the word. For
example, "rafters" will be stripped to "rafter." What this method
gains in speed, however, it loses in precision, and can sometimes cut
letters that are intrinsic to the word. The other possbility, called
"lemmatizing," involves looking up each word, one by one, in a
dictionary to find its appropriate root. Below is the code for
lemmatizing the text:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
clean = [WordNetLemmatizer.lemmatize(word, word) for word in no-stops]
#+END_SOURCE

At this point, the text is ready for analysis. One function,
~concordance()~ returns the context, that is, the immediate words
surrounding a target word. Below, the word "woman" is run through a
concordance of the words in /Orlando/:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE

#+END_SOURCE

Based off the contexts surrounding the target word, Python can make
further analyses. Another method, called ~similar()~ returns a list of
words used in similar contexts to the target word. To compute the
results of ~similar()~, NLTK first takes the context of the term from
~concordance()~, then it searches the text for other terms which
contain the same surrounding words. The result for running ~similar~
on the word "woman" is the following:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
man moment night boy word world child pen ship door one room window
light little lady table book queen king
#+END_SOURCE

By searching the text for words that appear in similar contexts to the
chosen word, this method might reveal words that have semantic
resemblance to the target word. It is important to point out, however,
that the computer does not impute meaning to the words. Rather, it
only counts words as strings, that is, bits of data composed of
alphanumeric sequences. It takes the string "woman," takes notes of
all of the strings in proximity to "woman," and then searches the rest
of the text for other strings that have similar proximities.

Basic NLP tasks offered by libraries like NLTK contrast with
algorithmic and "deep learning" methods that work in more
sophisticated ways to count and analyze language. Many of these
methods use the deep learning concept of "word embeddings" to ascribe
machine-interpretable meaning to strings. Like ~similar()~ and
~concordance()~, word embeddings build off patterns of word similarity
based on context. Unlike the NLTK methods, however, word embeddings
encode a value (actually, a list of values) to a given word based on
its context. The value of any given word is a numerical representation
known officially as a "word vector." A vector for a single word,
"woman," for example, will contain a list of numbers that represent a
similarity score between "woman" and another word. As numerical
representations, these values enable further quantitative exercises
that can analyze the relationship between "woman" and other words. The
classic example for introducing the potential of word embeddings is
the formula, "King - Man + Woman = Queen" (Mikolev et al. 2). Here,
gender (between "Man" and "Woman") is isolated as a computable
component which enables one to derive the difference between "King"
and "Queen". It almost goes without saying--the formula reproduces
gender as a binary structure, where "Queen" is computed through its
relation to "King" and "Man."

For example, the vector which represents "woman" contains a list of
numbers that score the similarity "woman" to other words. Here, the
word "woman" is most closely associated to the word "child," with a
similarity score, or "weight," of .93, or 93%, then with "mother,"
with .92, then "father," with .90.[fn:10] Below is a word vector of
words calculated to be most similar to "woman":

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
[('child', 0.9371739625930786),

Commonly, word embeddings are organized into a matrix, or tabular,
format:

| Target Word | child | mother | whose | called | person | wife |... |
|-------+-----+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+------+--- |
| Woman       | .937  | .921   | .917  | .915   |.914    |.909  |... |


In a matrix format, mathematical operations are possible using using
statistics, linear algebra, and calculus, which are the building
blocks of deep learning methods. In deep learning, the labels
accompanying the numerical representations do not matter, only the
list of numbers themeslves, which together represent the word
vector. The word "woman," therefore, would be represented with the
following vector: .937. .921, .917, .915, .914, .909, and so on. This
representation demonstrates that, even when removing labels, words are
still assigned meaning by their relation, their proximity, to other
words. In the following section, I use word embeddings as a starting
point to explore terms related to each gender in /Orlando/, starting
with the terms "woman" and "man."

** /Queer Distant Reading/
I now turn to Virginia Woolf's novel, /Orlando: A Biography/. This
novel is ideal for a computational study of gender for two
reasons. First it is perhaps the most salient example of transgender
narrative in the modernist era. Second, as many critics have noted,
its characterisitic modernist experimentation with limits of language
works toward destabilizing gender norms.[fn:11] Much of the scholarship
on this text explores its resistance against normative concepts of
identity and gender. The experimental use of language and narrative
form creates a narrative that is recalcitrant against coherent
understandings of gender and identity. Jane de Gay, Jill Channing, and
Christy L. Burns, for example, assert that Woolf deploys imaginative
elements, magical realism, and parody, respectively, to resist realism
and narrative expectations in her fictional biography. De Gay
describes Woolf's writing as "feminist historiography" that "rejected
Victorian patriarchal metanarratives" and instead "used the strategies
of fiction to bring history alive and make it live in the present" (de
Gay 71). In a similar vein, Burns and Channing both point out that
Woolf uses fantastical elements, in the former in the service of
parody, and the latter as part of magical realist writing, that
disrupt expectations of plot and narrative to challange the stability
of gender and identity. Doubling down on the role of langauge, some
critics emphasize that the narration purposefully obfuscates any
resolution about gender, identity, and even race and nationality. For
example, Victoria L. Smith asserts that "The fantastic content in the
novel is directly linked to the undecidability/impossibility of the
form of the novel and of the protagonist" (58).

In what follows, I
pursue a text analysis method that I call "iterative" for the way it
moves between close and distant reading, similar to what Andrew Piper
calls "bifocal" reading. My method feeds the output of computations
into close reading analysis, using the computer to identify words that
I then examine in context and with detail. This process, in Piper's
words, "no longer us[es] our own judgments as benchmarks... but
explicitly construct[s] the context through which something is seen as
significant (and the means through which significance is assessed)"
(17).

First, I begin with a list of terms computed similar to woman and man
in the text. Unlike the word embeddings from my previous section, the
embeddings here are trained on Woolf's novel, and therefore reflect an
understanding of gender markers based on how words are used in this
specific text. To get distinctive results for each gender, I modified
the code to remove any words with strong associations to the opposite
gender. For example, I compute words that are most positively
associated with "woman" and most negatively associated with "man."
Like the analysis by Underwood, I begin with a binary formulation of
gender. But this binary quickly destabilizes as I move deeper into the
close reading analysis, like Richard Jean So and Edwin Roland's study
of race. By /iterating/ through distant and close reading, the terms
swell with significations that pluralize the binary and, like Butler's
account of gender subversion, work toward resignifying the initial
results for "woman" and "man," which are the following:

#+END_SOURCE

At first glance, the top terms for each list appear to align with
existing conceptions of femininity and masculinity, such as "soft" for
"woman," and "chequered" for "man."  The rest of the terms also appear
to uphold a binary understanding of gender, with words like "frilled,"
"delicious," and "seductiveness," associated with "woman," and "fact,"
"defend," and "denounced" associated with "man." 

Next, I use some of these words as starting points for close-reading
analysis of the text. First, from the "woman" list, I examine the term
"delicious," which only appears after Orlando has transitioned into a
woman in the story. As I explain below, this term reveals a
relationship to queerness characterized by a distinctly feminine mode
of resistance. Then, from the "man" list, I examine a term that only
appears once in the novel, a significant moment which initiates what I
call the novel's "crisis of signification" with language. Following
this thread, I take a word from the "woman" list to examine another
passage, in which the crisis spreads from the level of external
narration to Orlando's interior reality. Finally, I examine in detail
a dense and dramatic passage that contains words from both the "woman"
and "man" list, a passage that connects this crisis of signification
with gender ambiguity and homosexual desire in the text.

I begin with the word "delicious," which occurs only after Orlando has
transitioned into a woman. Three of this terms five occurances appear
in a single passage, when Orlando is sailing from Turkey back to her
native England. The ship captain offers Orlando a bit of beef, which
sends her into a rapturous speculation about the joys of womanhood:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'A little of the fat, Ma'm?' he asked. 'Let me cut you just the
tiniest little slice the size of your fingernail.' At those words a
/delicious/ tremor ran through her frame. Birds sang; the torrents
rushed. It recalled the feeling of indescribable pleasure with which
she had first seen Sasha, hundreds of years ago. Then she had pursued,
now she fled.  Which is the greater ecstasy? The man's or the woman's?
And are they not perhaps the same? No, she thought, this is the most
/delicious/ (thanking the Captain but refusing), to refuse, and see
him frown. Well, she would, if he wished it, have the very thinnest,
smallest shiver in the world. This was the most /delicious/ of all, to
yield and see him smile. 'For nothing,' she thought, regaining her
couch on deck, and continuing the argument, 'is more heavenly than to
resist and to yield; to yield and to resist. 114
#+END_QUOTE
Here, "delicious" describes a refusal, then a yielding--the
vacillations of what appears to be a passive form of pleasure,
ostensibly opposed to the active pleasure of pursuit which Orlando
enjoyed as a man. Below, I will return to this active pleasure, and
the scene of its emergence, when Orlando meets Sasha. Here, although
the word "delicious" describes a distinctly feminine experience of
pleasure, which has to do with withholding and, eventually, submitting
to the active force, it is a pleasure rooted in what is not quite
passivity and not quite power.

To get a deeper understanding of "delicious" as a passive kind of
pleasure, I run another similarity search with "delicious" as the
target word. The top result, the word most related to "delicious" in
the text, is "culpable." I then turned back to the text to examine
when this word appears, which happens twice, both times in the same
scene on the ship, in the midst of Orlando's ruminations on the
pleasures between the sexes. The first occurs when Orlando is
considering her sexual desire for women:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And as all Orlando's loves had been women, now, through the culpable
laggardry of the human frame to adapt itself to convention, though she
herself was a woman, it was still a woman she loved; and if the
consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all, it was
to quicken and deepen those feelings which she had had as a man. 119
#+END_QUOTE
Here, "culpable" modifies "laggardry," which describes the obstinacy
of Orlando's romantic desire that persists in loving women, despite
that she is now a woman herself. "Culpable," from the Latin "culpa,"
meaning fault, here denotes a body deserving of blame for its refusal
to conform. It seems that, for Orlando, homosexual desire is defined
in part by a sense of guilt about this refusal to conform. The next
usage of this term occurs soon after, when Orlando reprises her
earlier ruminations:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'To refuse and to yield,' she murmured, 'how delightful; to pursue and
conquer, how august; to perceive and to reason, how sublime.'  Not one
of these words so coupled together seemed to her wrong; nevertheless,
as the chalky cliffs loomed nearer, she felt culpable; dishonoured;
unchaste, which, for one who had never given the matter a thought, was
strange. 120
#+END_QUOTE
Rehearsing the conventional roles of the sexes, roles which Orlando
fails to fit into, she feels "culpable," "dishonour[ed]" and
"unchaste"--words that distinguish her guilt as a feminine one. This
feminizing language deepens the relationship between desire, guilt,
and deliciousness, the last of which being a distinctly feminine
pleaure derived from a passivity that is not totally powerless. Here,
Orlando's refusal to conform, for which she feels culpable,
constitutes another form of passivity, a kind of refusal. The
connection between "delicious" and "culpable," then, characterize
queerness as a distinctly feminine mode of resistance. 

Now, I move to Orlando's experience as a man, returning to the
original list of similar terms. I begin with "chequered," which
appears only once, at the very beginning of the story, when Orlando
makes his entrance, stepping into "the yellow pools chequered by the
floor" (12). This moment is the first of many in which the narrator
calls into question his credibility as a biographer, a self-described
"scribe," who distinguishes his role from that of the poet that
embellishes and exagerrates through figurative language. However, the
narrator's committment to straightforward description soon gallops
into full-fledged figuration when he tries to describe Orlando's
beauty:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit
that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed
to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling
of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were
his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we
rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit
a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer
to ignore. 12-13
#+END_QUOTE
Here, the narrator's evocative language undermines the pretense to
objectivity which he feels so compelled to produce a few lines above
this one. This slip into figurative language eventually grows into a
crisis of signification that recurrs persistently throught the novel,
a crisis of self-doubt that is mirrored in Orlando's internal
experience. 

For Orlando, the crisis emerges during a period of depression
following his love affair with Sasha, a Russian princess. Here, I take
the term, "despaired" which, like "chequered," occurs only once in the
novel. Here, Orlando, deep in depression, struggles to understand the
role of figuration in language:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
So then he tried saying the grass is green and the sky is blue and so
to propitiate the austere spirit of poetry whom still, though at a
great distance, he could not help reverencing. 'The sky is blue,' he
said, 'the grass is green.' Looking up, he saw that, on the contrary,
the sky is like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall from
their hair; and the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls
fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods. 'Upon my
word,' he said (for he had fallen into the bad habit of speaking
aloud), 'I don't see that one's more true than another. Both are
utterly false.' And he despaired of being able to solve the problem
of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into a deep
dejection. 75
#+END_QUOTE
Like the narrator in the previous passage, Orlando also questions the
truthfulness of figurative elements. First, he attempts plain
language, "the sky is blue", "the grass is green," but these prove
insufficient for describing a sky that moves "like the veils which a
thousand Madonnas have let fall from their hair" and grass that
"fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of
hairy satyrs from enchanted woods."  Orlando, who has just been
abandoned by a woman, sees in nature movement and modesty, qualities
which he finds "false." It seems that, for Orlando, the problem has
something to do with the capacity of language to convey truth in plain
terms, of "say[ing] what one means and leav[ing] it."

In a final example, I examine the co-occurance of words from both
lists within a single passage, the scene where Orlando meets
Sasha. The words, "curiosity," which is associated with "man," and
"seductiveness," which is associated with "woman," appear in a moment
of intense, tumultuous desire about Sasha's gender
incomprehensibility. Together, the terms characterize gender as
intimately coordinated to language's ability to signify. The drama
begins when Orlando, upon seeing Sasha for the first time, cannot tell
whether she is a man or a woman:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
He beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him
with the highest /curiosity/. The person, whatever the name or sex,
was about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed
entirely in oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar
greenish-coloured fur. But these details were obscured by the
extraordinary /seductiveness/ which issued from the whole
person. Images, metaphors of the most extreme and extravagant twined
and twisted in his mind. He called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive
tree, an emerald, and a fox in the snow all in the space of three
seconds; he did not know whether he had heard her, tasted her, seen
her, or all three together. (For though we must pause not a moment in
the narrative we may here hastily note that all his images at this
time were simple in the extreme to match his senses and were mostly
taken from things he had liked the taste of as a boy. But if his
senses were simple they were at the same time extremely strong. To
pause therefore and seek the reasons of things is out of the
question)... A melon, an emerald, a fox in the snow--so he raved, so
he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must be--no woman could
skate with such speed and vigour--swept almost on tiptoe past him,
Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that the person was
of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the question. 27-28
#+END_QUOTE
Here, the passage directly coordinates the crisis of signification to
both gender ambiguity and language. Orlando uses seemnigly arbirary
metaphors, "A melon, an emerald, a fox in the snow," indicating that
at the same time which he cannot place Sasha's gender, he also cannot
find the right words to describe her. As Sasha's gender oscillates
between male and female throughout the passage, so the narrative voice
alternates between Orlando's interiority and the narrator's
commentary. Taking up this crisis of signifcation on the level of
narrative, the narrator's "pause" draws attention to the constructed
reality of the scene, as a representation of Orlando's story. This
constructed quality is reinforced by the narrator's attempt to explain
Orlando's choice of words to describe Sasha, which have no "reason,"
and "were mostly taken from things he had liked the taste of as a
boy." Language, like gender, becomes a tool for representation and
performance. As Pamela Caughie, asserts, the gender transgression is
intimately connection to the narrator's experiments in figuration and
form: "Woolf brings out the arbitrariness of [sexual] identity, the
arbitrariness of language itself, through Orlando's switching from one
sex to the other, and from one poetic language to another, as well as
through the shifting of her own rhetoric in this novel (42). This
text, with its "switching" and "shifting" discourse, which at once
asserts that language is deficient and that it overshoots the mark,
that it conveys plainness and poetry, implies that gender is also a
fluid phenomenon.

This argument, that /Orlando/'s subversiveness is a discursive one,
opens the text to numerous critiques[fn:12], particularly from Trans
Studies. According Jay Prosser, Woolf's experimentation with language
and narrative form belies the physical the embodied reality of
transsexuality. He argues that "Orlando is not about the sexed body at
all but the cultural vicissitudes of gender. As h/er narrative propels
h/er through four centuries of history, Orlando is free to move beyond
h/er body--quite queerly, to break through the limits of the flesh"
(Prosser 168). By "the sexed body," Prosser means the physical body
which is bound by the physical and social world. /Orlando's/'s
transgressiveness results from a play of /language/ and /literary
form/ that elides the specificity and the lived reality of the "sexed
body." Rather, due to its "ambivalence, a wavering around transition",
"a transformation of transition into new identity," its "easy
androgyny," this text is transgender (Prosser 169). As Caughie
asserts, /Orlando/'s transgressiveness comes from its discursive
moves: "Far from defeating sexual difference, as many feminist critics
claim, Orlando enacts it, enshrines it, exploits it, makes a spectacle
of it, but as a playful oscillation not a stable opposition" (Caughie
48).

A decade later, Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley writes about the problem of
gender fluidity as a metaphor. In her essay, "Black Atlantic, Queer
Atlantic: Queer Imaginings of the Middle Passage," Tinsley's main
argues for the imbrication of sexuality and race through the lense of
the Black Atlantic. By sexuality, Tinsley does not necessarily mean
"same-sex" desire, but relationships from the Middle Passage, that
"mak[e] disruption to the violence of the normative
order... connecting in ways that commodified flesh was never supposed
to" (199). Reading for relation rather than desire, her critique
re-works the trope of fluidity which, drawing from the ocean, "is not
an easy metaphor or queer and racially hybrid identities but for
concrete, painful, /and/ liberatory experience" (192-193). For
Tinsley, fluidity is an opportunity for "a return to the materiality
of water to make its metaphors mean more complexly, shaking off
settling into frozen figures" (212).  Reading from Dionne Brand's
book, /Map to the Door of No Return/ (2001), on the Middle Passage,
Tinsley theorizes fluidity as a "social liquidation," being stripped
by the water, particulars of identity washed away in the current. She
explains that "brown bodies are gender fluid not because they choose
parodic proliferations but because they have been 'washed of all this
lading, bag and baggage'" (209).

Tinsley's critique surfaces the ways that gender fluidity, as a trope
for queerness, obscures the very physical connotation of
corrosion. While this chapter, following Butler, has proposed
iterativity, which is a form of fluidity, as a kind of enabling
constraint that creates a possibility for resistance, I wonder how
Tinsley's evocation of materiality might deepen this analysis, opening
the potential of Queer Studies-inflected frameworks for text
analysis. One might think more deeply about the concept of iteration
and its connection to the productive power of language, the ways that
language physically executes action, for example, in computer
code. Python differs from other languages (like markup languages HTML
and XML, which I explore in the next chapter) in that it is an
executable language. The code not only defines instructions, but also
enacts them. How might this active quality of Python programming
influence the way that we study gender as an active, embodied
phenomenon?

[fn:1] Text analysis borrows from Natural Language Processing and
Machine Learning methods to do analyses like Topic Modeling, Sentiment
Analysis, and Logistic Regression (discussed below). Though these
methods differ in important ways, they share in basic tasks of
counting and classifying words and other textual elements with the
goal of predicting and visualizing patterns in text.

[fn:2] In the wake of the #metoo movement in 2017, three graduate
students accused Moretti of harassment and assault. Stanford
university claimed to be reviewing the case with no formal proceedings
or other action being taken. See Liu, Fangzhou and Hannah Knowles.

[fn:3] For a more thorough critique of Da's aims and methodology in
this article, please see Ben Schmidt's "A computational critique of a
computational critique of computational critique,"

[fn:4] In his book /Reading Machines/, Ramsay draws from the
deformative critical methods of Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels to
harness the enabling constraints of computation that "unleash the
potentialities" of the text, offering opportunities for new readings
(33).

[fn:5] In their introduction to /The Journal for Cultural
Analytics/'s "Identity Issue," Brown and Mandell situate feminist
debates around identity politics as a necessary context for
understanding how computational processes engage gender identity.

[fn:6] In her groundbreaking book, /Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity/ (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts two
essentialist views of sex and gender in contemporary feminist thought:
first, that sex is biological while gender is constructed; and second,
the gender, as a construction, is a self-expression of the
subject. According to Butler, there is no such thing as a subject that
exists prior to gender expression, as a subject only comes into being
by participating in a gender norm.

[fn:7] Common critiques of Butler point out the limits of this theory
for posing gender and sexuality as discursive. From the field of Trans
Studies, Jay Prosser problematizes Butler's "deliteralization of sex,"
a critique that he applies to Queer Studies more generally. Prosser
explains that because Butler's analysis attends to performativity as a
discursive phenomenon, it elides the real-world concerns of the body's
materiality. Prosser offers the example of Butler's reading of /Paris
Is Burning/'s Venus Xtravaganza who, Butler argues, occupies a space
of transgression due to her inability to attain her sex
change. According to Butler, a sex change that would "make [her]self
complete" would also fulfill the desire for a masculine body would
reinscribe heterosexual hegemony (45). Prosser points out that this
reading fails to reckon with the material body and its precarious
existence, as Venus's death illustrates (55). Butler's
"metaphorization of the transgender body" demonstrates one crucial way
that Queer Theory has subsumed, without fully accounting for,
transgressive desires in cross-gendered identifications.

[fn:8] Irigaray here critiques Jacques Derrida famously defines as
"phallogocentrism," the idea that man, symbolized by the phallus, is
the center and focus of knowledge.

[fn:9] Irigaray's concept of the "necessary outside" seems to
anticipate another popular critique of Butler's theory, from the field
of Political Philsophy, which claims a logical inconsistency in
Butler's theorization of subjectivity. If the resistance to
signification comes from outside the cycle of signification, does this
not imply a pre-discursive identity or at least desire for resistance?
Geoff Boucher writes that Butler locates the potential for subversion
"in a disembodied intentionality that appears to stand outside of the

[fn:12] Jamie Hovey and Jessica Berman both explore how the text
challenges the boundaries of national identity through an implicit
critique of imperialism, a critique that emerges from the privileged
position of the white, British persective. Hovey remarks that
/Orlando/ is "an ambivalent articulation of English nationalism," a
nationalism that intersects with (and depends on) gender and race
(Hovey 394). Displacing the oppressive effects of nationalism to
racialized and sexually transgresive subjects, the novel "allows the
protagonist to pass as respectible and heterosexual" (Hovey
398). Bringing the question of transsexuality to the fore, Berman
argue that as a "trans text," /Orlando/ utilizes methods of marking
and categorizing bodies to interrogate the structures and boundaries
of nationality (Berman 218). According to Berman, "The transnational
situation as also intrinsically transgender" (Berman 218). Berman's
account harps on "the disruptive, critical energy of the prefix
'trans'" to unpack the concept of "nation" and "nationality" (Berman
220).

[fn:21] Barad proposes a theory of "agential realism," a position that
resists theories of representationalism, or "the idea that a knowing
human agent symbolically expresses – or represents – some
thing-in-the-world (that thing is unchanged by that expression, and
that expression is more available or apprehensible to the subject than
the thing itself) ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 2).

[fn:20] Drucker implicitly refers to the first chapter from Franco
Moretti's /Graphs, Maps, Trees/ (2007), throughout which Moretti
graphs novels by their publication date between 1700 and 2000 and
draws conclusions about the relationship between genre and generations
of readers.

[fn:18] Her work also extends Michelle Alexander's ideas from /The New
Jim Crow/ (2010), which argues that modern society perpetuates racist
violence and segregation by criminalizing race through the war on
drugs and mass incarceration.

[fn:17] Potentially revise and deepen this section by linking to Barad
& Haraway on situated knowledges and feminist science: Being modular
in itself isn't bad, as long as you are aware of the ways that
modularity creates limitations/reductions of data. Modularity needs a
critical awareness of its own tools.

[fn:13] The ~similar_words()~ method from the nltk.text.ContextIndex
class functions very nearly like the ~Text.similar()~ method described
previously. Below is the definition of the ContextIndex class from the
NLTK source code. For more information, see "ContextIndex," NLTK Docs.

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
class ContextIndex(object):
    """
    A bidirectional index between words and their 'contexts' in a text.

    in a fixed window around the word; but other definitions may also
    be used by providing a custom context function.
