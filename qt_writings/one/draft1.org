*** chapter summary 
The burden of the chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of performativity, and how that
method enhances the critical process. It begins by debunking the
fantasy of falsifiable criticism, presenting a critique of moretti's
methodology and stylistic approach (eventually with accompanying text
analysis). It then goes into a critique of current distant reading
practices, discussing Ted Underwood, Nan Z. Da, to emphasize how these
practices can often reproduce the critic's assumptions. This section
also discusses the work of Johanna Drucker and Richard Jean So,
emphasizing that their methods do a good job deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I'm interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by producing new structures, or formalizations of these
texts. Then, I go into a history of textual scholarship, focusing
particularly on the work of Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode, who offer a deformative and speculative understanding
of critical analysis that is useful for my proposal. Then, I dip into
Queer Theory, in particular Judith Butler's concepts of performativity
and citation, which lend an understanding to the ways that critical
processes can subvert dominant structures through iteration, or
"performative citation." This notion of displacement through
repetition is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the
iterative process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures
that re-signify certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with
my reading of Virginia Woolf's /Orlando/, to show how our
understanding of "man" and "woman" in that text is re-signified
through this kind of text analysis.

Underwood & Da
- While before the emphasis was on data organization, now it is on the
  choice/selection of data. This is okay, but the differences between
  the two need to be acknowledged. 
- Thread the notion on collapsing assumptions about gender throughout
  the entire section, not just the Underwood critique. This needs to
  come to the fore of the argument. 
- Consolidate the quality that I'm trying to emphasize with my
  Underwood critique: is it standardization, ease of use, simplicity,
  or reproducibility??
- Address how Da's misunderstanding of Topic Modelling has been
  answered by Ben Schmidt in Critical Inquiry---not that this matters,
  because it nonetheless reveals a perspective on critical methods
  which values the reproducible. 
- Explain better reproducibility. 
 

** WAITING on reading methodology, orientations toward reading
our orientation toward reading determines the engagement --- we need
an orientation of play



**** paranoid reading/symptomatic reading/militant reading
There are several styles of literary analysis, which determine the
trajectory of readerly engagement with texts. Taking the name of
"paranoid reading," "militant reading," and "sympotmatic reading," is
a reading pratice that suggests a text's "truest" meaning resides in
what it does not say, what it cannot say.[fn:13] This reading practice
descends from a style of critique, originally popularized by Karl
Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Friedrich Nietzsche, driven by an almost
paranoid belief that power structures (the economy, the unconscious,
and moral systems, respectively) encode a certain ideology in culture
which will finally be demystified by critical analysis and
exposure. In literary criticism, Eve Kofosky Sedgwick describes
"paranoid reading" as the search for hidden or absent elements of text
that affect its interpretation. Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus define
this practice as "sympotmatic reading," which mines "absences, gaps,
and ellipses" for latent and recurring "symptoms," then speculates
upon “what those absences mean, what forces create them, and how they
signify the questions that motivate the text” (3). Rita Felski's
critique of "militant reading" emphasizes the affective quality of the
encounter between reader and text, what she describes as "a style of
interpretation driven by a feeling of disenchantment" (2). Felski
explains that this kind of reading aims "to expose hidden truths and
draw out unflattering and counterintuitive meanings that others fail
to see" (1).

In itself, this kind of reading practice can be an exhilarating and
rewarding exercise for literary critics. But, it creates a formula for
analysis that discourages other kinds of connection to text. It turns
reading into a mechanical practice of searching for what is hidden or
absent, and then exploring how this gap affects our understanding of
the text. Sedgwick explains that this reading process imposes an
"unhelpful structure" for analysis, where the complex substance of
textuality is conscripted into the interplay between "repression and
liberation" (12). This practice reduces the analytical process into
binary modes of thinking that quickly take over nuance and
ambiguity. Sedgwick "see[s] a cognitive danger in these
interpretations: a moralisitic tautology that became increasingly
incabable of recognizing itself as such" (12). She points out that,
because paranoia seeks its own affirmation, it reflects and confirms
its own desire on every surface. This process is replicated as the
search for meaning takes on other texts, imposing the same structure
on new material. In short, paranoid reading encourages a kind of
criticism that is reproducible.

**** different kinds of reading as "suspicious" reading
This kind of reading is particularly suceptible to digital methods for
literary criticism. Often, digital methods like quantitative text
analysis, or the computational processing of textual elements,
features, and style, the problem of absence is expanded to the problem
of scale. Because distant reading allows them to handle the thousands
of books in literary history without actually reading these texts, it
allows them to get around the problem of literary scale and human
attention. The capacity of the computer to process vast amounts of
text empowers some critics to pose ambitious questions for text
analysis. Franco Moretti's work, for example, examines the impact of
social and economic forces upon literary style and plot to pose broad
questions about how literary forms travel across time and space, what
he calls "morphological evolution." In his collection, /Distant
Reading/, Moretti expands his purview to what Margaret Cohen calls
“the Great Unread,” which requires a new methodology, “distant
reading”: “where distance… is a condition of knowledge: it allows you
to focus on units that are much smaller or larger than the text:
devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems” (48). Another
practitioner of distant reading, within the field of Computational
Literary Studies (CLS), Ted Underwood,[fn:5] harnesses the power of
quantification and machine learning to glimpse what he calls the
"distant horizon" of literary trends across centuries. More often than
not, this kind of distant reading is combined with close reading
methods, as critics will use the results of quantitative analysis to
identify key moments from the text that merit closer attention.[fn:4]

**** critique of moretti's falsifiable criticism 
Moretti's distant reading quantifies literary history and textual data
through a series of visualizations, such as graphs and diagrams, to
test hypotheses in a procedure closer to scientific experiment than
traditional literary criticism. Underlying Moretti’s work is a deep
concern with finding a method that may connect history with form. In
the introductory essay to his first book published in English, /Signs
Taken for Wonders/ (1983), Moretti calls for a “falsifiable criticism”
to search for the link between formalism and history. Moretti objects
to the analytical practice of contemporary literary critics that
"revolve[s] around concepts such as ‘ambiguity’ and the like" (Signs
Taken for Wonders 22). According to Moretti, "criticism will always,
inexorably, be pushed into multiplying, rather than reducing, the
obstacles every social science encounters when it tries to give itself
a testable foundation" (22). He then explains his criteria for a
"falsifiable criticism," which borrows from social scientific
methodology:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In principle, the criteria for testing literary interpretations should
be the same as those already in use in every other scientific
discipline. One should in other words demand of an interpretation that
is coherent, univocal, and complete. And the test will consist in
comparing it with data which—-in the text or texts that constitute its
object—-appear contradictory or inexplicable in the light of the
hypothesis itself. 21
#+END_QUOTE
Here, Moretti proposes a mode of critical inquiry that minimizes the
potential for difference and disagreement by laying an empirical
foundation that facilitates "coherent, univocal, and complete"
interpretations. Moretti's early reflections reveal an important with
the "falsifiable" that drives his development toward "quantitative
formalism." 

Morettie's approach suggests that the computer takes on the bulk of
the analytical work, and that the literary critic is just there to
interpret the results of analysis. The essays in /Distant Reading/
increasingly demonstrate how his critical method is streamlines into
the neat, recursive processes of hypothesis, collecting and assembling
data, and inference. The results are sometimes unexpected, but
thoroughly enlightening, and occasionally bring Moretti to reframe his
hypotheses. The culmination of Moretti’s quantitative method appears
among the final set of essays, particularly in “Style, Inc.:
Reflections on 7,000 Titles (British Novels, 1740-1850),” where he
plots data about book titles on a series of graphs in order to
speculate on market forces--"the title is where the novel as language
meets the novel as commodity" (181). Moretti summarizes his
conclusion: "As the market expands, titles contract; as they do that,
they learn to compress meaning; and as they do that, they develop
special ‘signals’ to place books in the right market niche”
(204). However, his language in the essay's introduction attributes
the force of his analysis to the quantitative process:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
/describe/ a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
/try to explain/ its causes; next, I /suggest/ how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I /make a little attempt/ at quantitative
stylistics, /examining/ some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
Moretti’s language here diminishes his intervention: he describe[s],
tr[ies] to explain, suggest[s] and make[s] a little attempt. Though
his speculations are provocative, Moretti presents them as
supplementary to the graphs. Yet, it is Moretti who asks the
questions: “by 1800 the number [of words in the title] had already
dropped to 5 to 10 percent. Why?”  (184); and answers them: “between
the size of the market, and the length of the titles, a strong
negative correlation emerged: as the one expanded, the other
contracted” (188). 

Moretti, if you follow his thought, is actually engaging in a
speculative method, using visualization to spark his imagination and
make conjectures, but he doesn’t embrace his own subjectivity, because
he’s going for a materialist history of literature. He makes
conjectures, but disguises them as “explanations”. He finds a way to
“explain” the trends in a graph. But his explanation is a guess.

For example, when charting the rise and fall of several genres of
English novels over the 18th and 19th centuries, he says that the
reason for these cycles is the readership, that a genre’s popularity
can be attributed to the taste of a generation (each cycle lasting
about 25 years), which is then supplanted by a new generation. What he
doesn’t account for is not only his conjecture, but for the nature of
his data, about the genres and novels themselves, which he culls from
monographs cited at the end of the chapter. His dataset comes from
literary critical studies, and he titles his bibliography--- “A
Taxonomy of Forms”, occluding its subjective nature. The way that he’s
using the graphs to spark his inquiry and conjectures shows an
underlying speculative method that’s guiding his criticism.

In digital contexts, the kinds of reading *passes off human
interpretation as "objective," to the computer* . Computers can read
at scale, therefore we now have the ability to study trends larger
than the human capacity for reading and memory. But computers aren't
meant to compensate for inabilities in the human, but to work within
human capacities.

**** playful text analysis, but not queer?
There are also, however, literary critics who use text analysis toward
more speculative ends --> but these aren't queer, they don't deal with
absence in the same way. 

“Distant Reading… where distance is however not an obstacle, but a
specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of
their overall interconnection...in which the reality of the text
undergoes a process of deliberate reduction and abstraction”
(Moretti 1)

Speculative Computing --- “push[es] subjective and probabilistic
concepts of knowledge as experience (partial, situated, and
subjective) against objective and mechanistic claims for knowledge as
information (total, managed, and externalized)” (Drucker 5).

Algorithmic Criticism --- Algorithmic criticism, according to Stephen
Ramsay in Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism,
approaches the constraints and objectivity of computational processes
as an opportunity for contemplation and conversation. “attempts to
employ the rigid, inexorable, uncompromising logic of algorithmic
transformation as the constraint under which critical vision may
flourish” (32). Rather than solve problems or answer questions
definitively, humanist critics engage in readings that are inescapably
partial and speculative. In this light, according to Ramsay,
computational methods enhance current reading strategies by harnessing
the constraints of computation to offer potential new readings: “The
computer revolutionizes, not because it proposes an alternative to the
basic hermeneutical procedure, but because it reimagines that
procedure at new scales, with new speeds, and among new sets of
conditions” (31). Activities such as compiling word frequency lists,
diagramming social relationships, or plotting various textual data not
only transform texts into new forms from which the critic may
speculate, but are grounded in inherently critical moves, such as
asking questions or identifying problems. Borrowing from Jerome McGann
and Lisa Samuels’ concept of “deformance,” or the deliberate
distortion or transformation of texts, Ramsay suggests that critics
employ computational methods to select or rearrange textual data into
new forms, or “paratexts,” for further reflection and analysis. Ramsay
maintains that all critical reading is a deformative activity insofar
as it prioritizes certain textual data—formal patterns, words,
devices—over others and delivers a new, alternative text. For example,
in his analysis of Virginia Woolf’s novel, The Waves, Ramsay uses a
computer program to generate lists of distinctive terms uttered by
each of the six speakers in Woolf’s novel. Ramsay emphasizes how this
method “puts forth not the [original] text, but a new text in which
the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and
transduced” (16). To say, as a result, that the word frequencies
“confirm” or “verify” what other critics have argued about the
characters assumes that literary criticism aims for singular
answers. Rather, the point of such an exercise is to “unleash the
potentialities” of the text, offering opportunities for new readings
(33). Ramsay point out that “we are not trying to solve Woolf. We are
trying to ensure that discussion of The Waves continues” (15).

(33). Ramsay point out that “we are not trying to solve Woolf. We are
trying to ensure that discussion of The Waves continues” (15). So one
question continually leads to another, and so on, and the goal lies in
this process—to arrive, over and over. Here, rhetorical coherence
appears to be the only standard:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The understanding promised us by the critical act arises not from a
presentation of facts, but from the elaboration of a gestalt, and it
rightfully includes the vague reference, the conjectured similitude,
the ironic twist, and the dramatic turn. In the spirit of inventio,
the critic freely employs the rhetorical acts of conjecture—not so
that a given matter can be settled, but in order that the matter might
become richer, deeper, and ever more complicated. 16
#+END_QUOTE
The analysis centers around the rhetorical ability of the critic,
whose only goal is to convince the reader of her position, regardless
of what that may be.

Reading Computationally, a bifocal process: There is a mixing of
different modes of reading. Distant reading provides context, or
framework, for close reading. The subjectivity of the critic becomes
entangled with the object of study.

Touching/Feeling
Sedgwick searches for "some ways of understanding human desire that might
be quite to the side of prohibition and repression, that might hence
be structured quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory,'
inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting down and attacking
prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic guises" (10).

Postcritical Reading…  “in this sense, is not just a cognitive
activity but an embodied mode of attentiveness that involves us in
acts of sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering, and engaging”
(Felski 176). 

synthesis: In some ways, all the critics treated in this essay regard
the surface level of language—particularly linguistic patterns—as
grounds for analysis, though only algorithmic criticism
self-consciously approaches this stance. In what follows, I will
examine how these critics’ divergent methods cohere into similar
practices, before explaining the implications of each one on the
future of literary studies. First, there is significant overlap
between surface reading, distant reading, and algorithmic criticism in
that all three make use of selective reading—that is, picking out
certain details from texts to analyze—with or without the aid of
computers. Specifically, both surface and distant reading make use
historical or material contexts, such as publication history and and
the non-canonical archive; and both surface reading and algorithmic
criticism invest immense importance in finding patterns in texts, even
if they direct this activity toward different ends. Second, distant
reading and algorithmic criticism visualize or arrange textual data to
stimulate analysis. Moretti’s graphs and maps function similarly to
Ramsay’s textual transformations which “stand alongside the other
[original text], impressing itself upon it and upon our own sense of
what is meaningful” (12). Interestingly, in describing his diagram of
character interactions in Hamlet, Moretti addresses this network of
character-relations as something like Ramsay’s “paratext”:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
Though Horatio is an old fixation of mine, I had never fully
understood his role in Hamlet until I looked at the play’s network
structure. The keyword, here, is ‘looked’; what I took from network
theory was its basic form of visualization: the idea that the temporal
flow of a dramatic plot can be turned into a set of two-dimensional
signs… that can be grasped at a single glance. (211) 
#+END_QUOTE
Moretti’s diagram of Hamlet enacts something analogous to Ramsay’s
“deformance,” which involves transforming texts into new
configurations (such as diagrams or word frequency lists) that
stimulate potential readings. Seen in this light, the space between
distant, surface, and algorithmic criticism seems to collapse.

**** what kind of reading do we want to do? queer + digital?
movement, play, reconfiguration --> allows us to engage with queer
theory / performance. 

This chapter proposes a method of reading that grapples with the
tension to unearth hidden, latent, or absent meaning in text. It takes
this tension to texts that have a history of embedding ideology about
marginalized identities, particularly about sexuality. How can we read
the queerness of texts not by what they hide, but what they show? The
stakes is preserving the role of the aesthetics in critique.


~~~~



Felski: At stake is our receptivity: “to allow ourselves to be marked,
struck, impressed by what we read” (12).  "We shortchange the
significance of art by focusing on the “de” prefix (its power to
demystify, destabilize, denaturalize) at the expense of the “re”
prefix: its ability to recontextualize, reconfigure, or recharge
perception” (Felski 17).

"the reader-text connection becomes part of a network rather than a
self-enclosed dyad— yet a connection that remains vital to literary
studies, especially in the classroom. Reading, in this light, is a
matter of attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging
links between things that were previously unconnected. It is not a
question of plumbing depths or tracing surfaces… Interpretation
becomes a coproduction between actors that brings new things to light
rather than an endless rumination on a text’s hidden meanings or
representational failures” (Felski 174)

Surface reading challenges that search for absence by compelling a
reader to stay with what the text says and how it says it rather than
moving ahead to probe how it reflects and refracts larger cultural
patterns. This critique reifies aesthetic objects and suggests that
literary critics should embrace the literary.

Surface reading, according to Sharon Marcus and Stephen Best in
“Surface Reading: An Introduction,” attends to the textual surface for
what is visually, materially, and affectively immanent, rather than
what is concealed or implied beneath the surface (9). In “attend[ing]
to the surfaces of texts rather than plumb their depths,” the editors
present a useful and exciting new reading method that observes the
materialities, patterns, verbal complexities and mediations of texts
(Best, Marcus 1-2). 

There is the “embrace of the surface as an affective and ethical
stance,” which prioritizes the reader’s affective response and the
experience of reading (Best, Marcus 10).  ...


**** Felski and emotionally guided criticism

Rita Felski’s “The Limits of Critique”.  

Here, Felski crystalizes something that many of these critics do not
address---the role of affect in criticism. Her critique of
“hermeneutics of suspicion,” which she calls a militant mode of
reading, finds that the desire to unearth or discover secrets in the
text is actually a harmful one, because it forecloses possibilities of
connection and being moved by these texts. The affective modes of
suspicion include disenchantment, vigilance, paranoia. Felski wonders
what if we allowed ourselves to be marked or struck by what we
read. Then, rather than just be a cognitive activity, reading can
become an “embodied mode of attentiveness that involves us in acts of
sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering, and engaging” (176). She
wants to bring the body back into criticism.


** on reproducible criticism
*** Underwood et al

Major developments in technology also perpetuate racial
assumptions. Moving from networking technologies to software
development, Tara McPherson explores the parallels between the
Operating Systems and race relations, to show how the development of
computer software betrays hegemonic assumptions about whiteness and
elisions of difference.[fn:1] She focuses on the key moment of 1960s
United States, when Operating Systems, which is the foundational
software that supports a computer's programs and basic functioning,
developed alongside civil rights discourses. Her research focuses on
how "the organization of information and capital" in OS development
resonates in the struggles for racial justice: "Many of these shifts
were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
radicalism" (30). McPherson deconstructs the UNIX operating system
which includes a hierarchical file system, a command line interpreter
(the Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), and a variety of
software programs that are designed to work in tandem. McPherson
points out that UNIX-based Operating Systems (like Mac and Linux) are
distinguished by the ways that they partition and simplify complex
processes into discrete components, similar to the ways that identity
politics cordones off parts of the (social and technological) system
into distinct units. While this cordoning was productive for the
promotion of civil rights, it also, according to McPherson, "curtailed
and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing
struggle to fairly discrete parameters" (30).

Crystallizing the intersection between Operating Systems and race
relations, McPherson asserts that "Certain modes of racial visibility
and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing
data" (24). McPherson emphasizes the "rules" of UNIX philosophy, which
lay out how UNIX's development prioritized the organization and
simplification of data processing:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear
by demonstration that nothing else will do. Rule of Transparency:
Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier... Rule
of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be
stupid and robust. 26
#+END_QUOTE
The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions. The rule of "Transparency" flattens
nuance and ambiguity, making program components as legible as
possible. The rule of "Representation," particularly the suggestion to
"Fold knowledge into data" reduces the complexity of raw data, so that
it can be easily input into multiple processes. According to
McPherson, all of these rules work together to shore up the central
design theory of "modularity,"[fn:2] which stipulates that components
are self-contained and interoperable, so they can be independently
created, modified, and replaced without affecting the whole system.

The role of control in creating the internet and the emphasis on data
reduction in developing operating stystems leave their legacies on
21st century digital technology, where race becomes collapsed into
data. Echoing McPherson, Ruha Benjamin asserts that technology
reproduces social inequities under the guise of objectivity and
progressivism.[fn:3] Turning to technology, Benjamin explores how
innovations in Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic computing
extend racist paradigms into ever new tools, particularly in data
gathering and surveillance. The creators of these new technologies
mark, track, and quantify blackness, for example, in databases for
healthcare or financial services that associate "black names" with
criminality (Benjamin 5). With each update, technology is continually
promoted as efficient and progressive in a way that masks how it
exploits data about its subjects. Benjamin explains, "we are told that
how tech sees “difference” is a more objective reflection of reality
than if a mere human produced the same results... bias enters through
the backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6). As she points out, "the road
to inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7). Like the creators of
UNIX, the creators of such tools and algorithms operate under
assumptions of white universality that inevitably marks blackness as
"other."

*** Underwood & Da on reproducibility

Let us now turn to computational methods, seeing how they bear out
some of the legacies from the above technological
histories. 

Practitioners of "distant reading," a critical method at the
intersection of Literary Studies and Data Science, use quantitative
analysis to study works of literature. This process involves deploying
computer programs to clean, categorize, and count elements in textual
data, and is often followed by interpretive analysis, where the critic
engages the results of quantification from a humanities
lense. 

According to its practitioners, distant reading is most useful for the
ways it allows connections to emerge among vast amounts of textual
data. Underwood's argument convincingly begins with the observation
that human capacities of sight, attention, and memory preclude them
from grasping the larger patterns of literary history across
time. Distant reading, where "distance" means abstraction, or the
simplification of textual data into computable objects such as
publication dates and genres, allows critics to see connections amid
the swarm of overflowing information.

Among distant reading practitioners, Underwood's approach is unique in
that he models the ways that human assumptions can affect the results
of analysis. Underwood is careful to point out the subjective nature
of his method, which he calls "perspectival modelling," by turning it
into an object of study. He uses machine learning, or programs
"trained" by certain data sets, to create models that can then make
predictions on other datasets. He explains that, "Since learning
algorithms rely on examples rather than fixed definitions, they can be
used to model the tacit assumptions shared by particular communities
of production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
93). One of his projects examines gender roles in novels from the
18th century to the 21st century by using a machine-learning model to
"guess" the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated
with that character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on--excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. /Distant Horizons/ 115
#+END_QUOTE
In simplest terms, the program studies some given adjectives
associated with a male or female character in order to make
predictions about other characters' genders. Inevitably, the resulting
output is always determined by this initial input. Underwood carefully
asserts that these models reveal, not the truth of literary histroy,
but the approaches and choices made by those who create the models:
"Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and
rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence
used to train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
92). This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles
in novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (/Distant Horizons/ 114). The graph shows a steady
overlapping of words traditionally associated with women, such as
"heart," with words typically assoicated with men, like "passion,"
toward the middle of the 20th century. One of the many explanations
for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice of writing
became more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the middle of the
20th century than it was previously (/Distant Horizons/ 137). This
fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about men than
women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline in
female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly paradoxical
conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while the actual
prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be possible.

However, the results of Underwood's "perspectival modeling" can only
be as good as the questions he asks. From a critical gender
perspective, Underwood's approach imposes the very structure that he
is attempting to deconstruct. In other project, he where he similarly
measures the "transformations" of gender across time periods, he
explains that simplification is necessary ("Machine Learnig and Human
Perspective" 93):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
#+END_QUOTE
Underwood admits that he needs a "simple" model in order to bring into
relation the dynamics of gender (See Fig. 2).[fn:6] However, he
underestimates the extent to which his initial assumptions determine
the final result. Although he considers the possibility that he finds
a structural tension between gender "because [he] explores gender, for
the most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant Horizons 140), he
neglects to consider how the collapsing of gender into a single graph
perpetuates the structural categories of male/female in a way that is
neglects the assumptions behind such a category.[fn:7] Moreover, the
issue is not just with the assumptions at the outset which reproduces
the result, but with the guiding question of the entire project, which
is not about deconstructing gender, but about reifying it. To begin
with, why should humanists seek to automate the conscription of gender
norms within these terms? Asking a machine to replicate the
conscription of gender for the purpose of seeing how male and female
roles in novels change over time only creates a model of gender that
is "simple" enough to be computed by the system. How does simplifying
the concept of gender contribute to our study of it? The results of
using the machine can only be as good as the questions we ask.

Critiquing scholars like Underwood, Nan Z. Da argues that quantitative
methods are ill-suited for literary criticism. She accusses Underwood
and other distant reading practitioners for trading "speed for
accuracy, and coverage for nuance" (620). Of her many gripes with
quantitative methods, which include "technical problems, logical
fallacies," and a "fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical tools
that are used and the objects to which they are applied" (601), she
emphasizes the lack of reproducible results, the idea that one
researcher's process can be reproduced by another with identical
output, which is essential to statistical methodologies. She
demonstrates with an experiment of Topic Modelling, which is the
processing of large texts in order to generate a number of "topics"
within the corpus. Researchers often use Topic Modelling as a way of
speed-reading a massive corpus to get a sense of what it is about
without having to actually look at the text. Da attempts to verify the
results of a Topic Modelling experiment by replicating the process on
her own machine, a replication that fails. She concludes that, "if the
method were effective, someone with comparable training should be able
to use the same parameters to get basically the same results"
(628-629).[fn:8] For Da, reproducibility of method is a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of quantification.

Despite their vastly different committments, scholars like Underwood
align with Da on the value that they place on reproducibility, which
is an ultimately conservative investment. Underwood demonstrates how
the critic reproduces their assumptions in the questions and data used
at the outset in a way that structures the final result. Da's emphasis
on the reproducible suggests that, to be useful, quantitative literary
criticism ought to resemble something more like statistical analysis:
if the method can be verified, can be copied and reproduced, then the
interpretive conditions might be universalized. 

*** Drucker's skewing the graphs

Underwood and Da overlook the way that quantification can be used to
disrupt assumptions or reveal the constructed nature of data. In
contrast to Underwood and Da, Johanna Drucker is careful to dispell
the illusion of "raw data," which comes already reduced to fit
whatever parameters required by analysis. Because data always
undergoes a transformation in order to be quantified, its complexity
has already been compromised. As a result, Drucker argues,
quantification techniques such as visualizations in graphs and charts
inevitably misrepresent the data they are meant to convey. To
illustrate this process, Drucker presents a chart displaying the
amount of books published over several years. The chart appears to
convey production during this specific time period, but Drucker
explains that publication date is an arbitrary metric for capturing
production.[fn:9] She brings to the surface all the assumptions made
in such a metric, for example, the limitations of "novel" as a genre
and the connotations behind "published," which suggests date of
appearance, but has no indication of composition, editing, review,
distribution. Each piece of data carries with it the result of many
interpretive decisions, that carry with them varying degrees of
opacity, which are all necessary in order to present complex concepts
like book production as a bar on a chart. Drucker explains: "the
graphical presentation of supposedly self-evident
information... conceals these complexities, and the interpretative
factors that bring the numerics into being, under a guise of graphical
legibility" (Drucker par. 23).

To resist the reductions of "data," a term that deceptively connotes
that which is "given," Drucker proposes thinking of data as "capta,"
which suggests that which is taken. Drucker's "capta" is deliberately
creative, turning graphical expressions into expressive metrics:
components used for measurement, like lines or bars on a graph, break,
blur, or bleed into one another. Objects are not discrete entities,
but interact with the other objects in the visualization. For example,
in a bar graph of book publications by year, she warps the graphical
metrics, making some of them fuzzy, wider, shorter, in an attempt to
show that publication as a metric elides other information such as
composition, editing, purchasing, etc.

[[./img/Drucker.png]]

Emphasizing "capta" is a way of figuring elements that have been
reduced, resolved, or ignored in traditional quantitative
analysis. Drucker makes evident what is overlooked or assumed when
dealing with complex subjects by muddling (rather than simplifying)
the relationship between elements.

*** Mandell: deconstructing gender with computation
Drucker points out how data that is taken (capta) can be rendered
graphically to sugesst the complexity of that data. Laura Mandell
similarly explores solutions for approaching the reduction of data,
particularly of gender, into what she calls the "M/F binary."[fn:10]
Mandell critiques recent uses of stylometery by Matthew Jockers and
Jan Rybicki, which analyze "masculine" or "feminine" modes of writing
by computing syntax, diction, and other linguistic features. Mandell
demonstrates how the M/F binary is reified "by presenting conclusions
about “male” and “female” modes of thinking and writing as if the M/F
terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently
referential and not discursively constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's
examination marshalls key findings from feminist theory, drawing from
Judith Butler, among others, to assert that gender is a socially
constituted category, a "performance" that can be historicized. She
illustrates the guiding power of the M/F binary in her critique of
Jockers and Rybicki, which find that they essentialize gender by
relying on stereotypes in their premises.

Rather than discount quantitative methods, however, Mandell suggests
that it can open up the way we deconstruct our understanding of
quantification and gender: "if we admit that categories such as gender
are being constructed both by the measurer and the measured... we
might then be able to use stylometry to experiment with new taxonomies
of gender" (par. 37). To demonstrate how gender is "constructed," she
poses a counter experiment with genre, which finds that genre analysis
cuts across the gender binary. She comapres the stylistic qualities of
a female writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, against two male writers,
William Godwin and Samuel Johnson, revealing that: "Wollstonecraft’s
sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble Godwin’s sentimental
anti-Jacobin novels... whereas her essays most resemble Johnson’s
writings" (par. 29). Wollenstonecraft's writing resembles both male
and female writing, depending on the genre. To analyze the highly
constructed category of "gender," then, one must also consider genre:
"separating gender from other markings (genre, era of composition) is
not possible: historical time and genre are not incidental to, but
constitutive of, gender" (par. 35).

The similarities between gender and genre, however, work to evacuate
how gender is /constitutive/ of the subject. She points out that both
are kinds of performance than can be learned: "features of both gender
and genre, while highly discernible, are also highly
imitable. (par. 30). Mandell asserts that "Anyone can adopt gendered
modes of behavior, just as anyone can write in genres stereotypically
labeled M/F" (par.30). Here, she takes Butler's points about gender
performativity beyond its purview: indeed, Butler's description of
performativity as a process, rather than a singular act, emphasizes
the lack of an autonomous subject that performs gender. In /Bodies
that Matter/, her follow-up to /Gender Trouble/, Butler explicitly
warns against the interpretation that gender is decided by the
subject, to be put on and off at will like clothing. Rather, according
to Butler, the subject /is produced/ by gender, which allows the
subject to emerge: "construction is neither a subject nor its act, but
a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and 'acts' come to
appear at all" (xviii). Crucially, Butler asserts that gender
/precedes/ and /constitutes/ the subject. This is not to say that
Mandell is wrong about gender being constructed, but that her
assumption, that "categories such as gender are being constructed both
by the measurer and the measured" misses an important point about the
autonomy of subject (par. 38). According to Butler, the subject only
emerges as an effect of gendered performance.

Even so, Mandell's work suggests further ways of drawing attention to
the complexity of gender, which harness the interactive affordances of
the computer. Her emphasis on visualization and movement inform how
one might "animate numerical processes rather than fixing their
results as stereotype" (par. 7). The dynamicity of computation, which
allows one to run data iteratively, feeding new inputs into new
results, complicates any straighforward understanding of the M/F
binary. Mandell explains that “Computer screens... afford the fluid
exploration of parameters and taxonomies, through which many sorts of
experiments can be tested: interactive visualizations can give us not
objective answers rooted in aggressively reductive oppositions, but
parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very complex reality”
(par. 38). She points to programming and visualization tools to
emphasize how they might multiply our understanding of gender:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We could break the algorithm’s capacity to produce “a strong gender
signal” by simply increasing the number of gender categories to be
sorted. Experts in the field could create metadata to generate a
completely new taxonomy to replace the tired M/F binary: “men writing
as men,” “women writing as women, “women writing as men,” “men writing
as women,” “unspecified (anonymous) writing as men,” “unspecified
writing as women,” “men writing as men (byline) in the voice of a
woman (woman narrator),” “men writing as unspecified (anonymous
byline) in the voice of a woman,” “women writing as men (byline) in a
voice of unspecified,” etc.—whatever categories are presented by title
pages, prefaces, narrators’ discourses, and research into authorship
attribution found. par. 36
#+END_QUOTE

Mandell points to manipulation of gender categories, which gives the
researcher more opportunities for input.

*** So & Roland: using machine to ignite human thinking

One example of distant reading explores how computation might handle
questions of racial identity and discourse in novels. Richard Jean So
and Edwin Roland use machine learning to explore the constructedness
of social categories like race by experimenting with an algorithm that
evaluates authorship by race according to the vocabulary used by the
author.  When they look more closely into these results, they find
that the algorithm reveals different levels of variance in words
traditionally attributed to white and black authors. While novels by
white authors are distinguished by a low variance in this vocabulary,
novels by black authors show a greater variance in vocabulary
(66). They conclude that white authorship as a category only coheres
when it evaluates against the incoherence of black authorship. Put
simply, they find that whiteness as a category /depends/ on the
characterization of blackness.[fn:11] They point out that, of course,
this process is useful not for what we learn about race but for what
we learn about the machine, particularly in the way that the results
reveal errors that open up areas for further analysis. They isolate
one text, James Baldwin's novel, /Giovanni's Room/ (1956), which was
wrongly categorized as being written by a white author. So and Roland
point out that this misclassification evokes a critical debate about
this text's elision of explicit references to race and sexuality,
whereby blackness is displaced in favor of an implicit whiteness that
serve to "cipher[s] identity" (69). The algorithm revealed six words
in /Giovanni's Room/ that influenced the categorization, one of them
in particular signals white authorship, the term "appalled." This term
only occurs once in the text, in the early scene where David (the
narrator) describes his relationship to his father. Here, David
regrets his friendliness which comes at the expense of his
fatherliness: "I did not want to be his buddy. I wanted to be his
son. What passed between us as masculine candor exhausted and appalled
me" (Rpt. in So and Roland 71). So and Roland's analysis emphasize the
connotations of whiteness in "appalled," which has the middle French
root, "apalir," meaning "to grow pale" (71). They insightfully
conclude that the word "appalled" in the text marks "the moment David
develops a troubled relationship to normative masculinity [as] also
the moment he becomes 'white'" (71). Their analysis thus contributes
to the ongoing debate about the imbrication between race and sexuality
in the novel.

In a sense, So and Roland are confronting the same problem as Da: what
to do with a case of computational error [which comes with attendant
assumptions about reproducibility...]. But rather than write off
quantitative methods, So and Roland suggest an interesting way out of
the problem: use the error as a starting point for further
analysis. While "Race is a category that escapes measurement or simply
renders it untenable," the machine is an apt tool for studying this
category (60). They isolate the error as an opportunity to explore the
differences in the ways humans and machines might approach racial
identity. Because race is a social construct, and machines only impute
meaning that is encoded into them, than it stands to reason that
machines might be ideal instruments for studying the construction of
race. Thus they turn the central mismatch between data analysis, which
works to "identify and label objects," and minority discourse
analysis, which "critique[s] and problematize[s] the very idea of
categories," into a point for interrogation (63). In this case, the
algorithm offers an opportunity for understanding how whiteness as a
category depends on the contrast of blackness as "other." Quantifying
race reinforces differences, reductions, stratification, as “Reading
race distantly thus requires quantification of racial identity or
racialized language” (60). Looking more closely at the specific
results of this analysis, like the function of the term "appalled" in
/Giovanni's Room/, they can make more daring leaps of speculation
about how whiteness, while displacing blackness, also gestures toward
a troubled understanding of gender and potentially, sexuality. So and
Roland assert that: "If the general class of the misclassified points
to the erosion of the machine's initial binary understanding of white
and black, a close analysis of a single misclassified text can reveal
what precisely motivates that ontological undoing" (68). Rather than
being "fundamentally mismatched," the machine and minority discourse
are particularly suited for one another, as the machine uses highly
constructed and reductive method that allows practitioners to
deconstruct social categories.

The example with "appalled" is totally idiosyncratic--the word occurs
once through the entire novel. But paying attention to error upends
the value of reproducibility. Because race is a construct, we must use
a "reflexive method that is able to identify its own elisions while
also pointing to new insights and opportunities for research”
(72). Roland and So's work combines a deconstructive with a
speculative methodology. They run a computation, look for an error,
and use that error as an opportunity to learn about the ways that
categories are constructed. They assert their goals: “To illustrate
the limits of standard computational methods for the analysis of race
and to produce a series of results that nonetheless advance our
understanding of the texts and authors under investigation… exposing
the racial limitations of computation can reveal things otherwise
occluded within literary history” (61). They are using computers in an
unintuitive way, computing for indeterminacy. While this work is
essential for bringing together quantitative and critical race
discourses, it also doesn't give enough credit to the ways that
/computers/, in presenting formalized schemas of race, transform data
toward speculative ends. This is to suggest that perhaps a
deconstructive and specualtive methodology is too ambivalent. What if
we began with the notion of the appalled?  What if we looked further
into the way that race is generated by vocabulary?  Not in order to
further understand how race operates (computers will never be as
subtle thinkers as we are), but to direct human subtlety more attently
to computer output. What if, rather than using the machine to study
human constructs, we used the machine to spur human thinking?

*** WAITING synthesis of Mandell and SoRoland
Both Mandell and SoRoland are using the machine to take apart these
categories of race and gender.
But let's look to the ways that the machine presents ever new
configurations of race and gender. Let's look at the form as a /queer
form/. 

we are going to propose a method of text analysis that deconstructs a
text for the purpose of producing new structures, new paratexts. 
**** → What kind of knowledge are we trying to create? Aren't we now
    operating as if it is possible to “distant read” in the first
    place? That there are things which can be quantified, if only we
    ask the right questions? When we look to the "occluded", are we
    hunting or speculating?  The orientation we take toward our object
    has an effect. Are we trying to recover or to speculate?


** textual scholarship and deformance
how dh methods descendant from textual scholarship offer a model of
deformance that can incorporate key ideas from queer theory, like
citationality/resignification, to do distant reading.
*** distant reading not to achieve scale, but for reconfiguration 
According to Underwood, distant reading is less useful for studying a
single text in depth and more useful for taking a long view of larger
corpora. He sets up an opposition between computer and human reading:
"Computational analysis of a text is more flexible than it used to be,
but it is still quite crude compared to human reading; it helps mainly
with questions where evidence is simply too big to fit in a single
reader's memory" (xxi). He is right to point out that a computer
cannot (yet) draw inferences like a human can, and that a human cannot
"read" at the same speed as a computer. Yet, his emphasis on the
limitations of human memory suggests another way that that computers
can guide and enhance the human reading of smaller texts. What the
computer properly does is arrange a set of data--of any size--for
human consumption. This involves processing datasets into new forms
and configurations that can then be scrutinzed by a human
reader. Although Underwood uses distant reading to "to find a
perspective that makes... scholars all congruent with each other,"
quantitative methods can supplement human memory by approaching
memory, specifically working memory, as a resource, rather than a
hindrance (/Distant Horizons/ 32). The computer can re-arrange text in
a way that focuses the attention span of the reader on elements
previously unseen or overlooked. Underwood's focus on
falsifiability--the idea that distant reading can process more
evidence to give a more "complete" picture--blocks out the ways that
the ways that quantitative literary analysis, or distant reading,
works in coordination with existing human capacities.
*** Textual scholarship offers a new way of looking at text
Now we shift our attention to a body of literary criticism that offers
another perspective for handling textual data. The field of textual
scholarship, and particularly the editorial practice of deformance,
opens up a way of thinking about data that is performative rather than
representative. Critics like Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode take an approach toward text that resists the
conservatism of traditional textual scholarship, which has generally
aimed for the recovery and preservation of the ideal text. Rather than
pursue recovery, these textual scholars explore new ways of reading
our textual inheritance that creates new possibilities for discovery
and speculation. Their methodology opens a space for key ideas in
queer theory about how to work within (and resist) the constraints of
language as a significatory system. This is about working within a
system to transcend the determining structure of that system.

*** overview of textual scholarship 
To proceed, I will present a historical trajectory of editorial
practices that tells a story of textual scholarship. Textual
scholarship is the study, annotation, and editing of textual
materials, like manuscripts and books. Within textual scholarship,
textual criticism focuses specifically on identifying and analyzing
variants of manuscripts and books with the purpose of selecting an
ideal witness as the basis for a critical edition. As they further
idealize the value of authorial intention, theories of textual
criticism increasingly delimit the purpose and purview of the
editor. The history of textual criticism thus presents an arc, which
first tends toward I call the conservative or restorative and then,
with the advent of digital technology, the productive. With the
popularization of digital tools, editing becomes less about restoring
or correcting a text, and more about finding ways to open up the way
that a text is read and interpreted. My purpose here is to carve a
critique that emphasizes how the /creative/ capacity functions within
textual editing paradigm. My reading will therefore look to ways that
editorial pracitices have opened up a space for the editor's role as a
content creator rather than recoverer or preserver.

The conservatism of textual editing begins with Ronald B. McKerrow,
leading twentieth-century Shakespearean scholar. McKerrow proposed an
influential model for "copy-text" editing, which bases the text (the
"copy-text") on an early witness that most closely resembles the
author's original intention. The editor defers to this text for
editing, favoring the earliest copy-text to settle differences among
variants. However, this approach created its own resistance among
textual scholars, who decried the "the tyranny of the copy-text."
While maintaining reliance on an early copy-text for accidentals
elements like punctuation and spelling, the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle
method of textual criticsm empowers editors to judge between numerous
witnesses the text's more substantive elements[fn:12]. The resulting
critical edition is eclectic, drawing from multiple sources and
depending heavily on the editor's judgment to determine authorial
intention. Fredson Bowers and Thomas Tanselle advanced Walter
W. Greg's influential work, /The Rationale of Copy-Text/, further
extending the importance of authorial intention and encouraging
editors to make careful and deliberate choices about substantive
elements. Tanselle, in particular, places much value in the editor who
is able to recongize and manage inevitable textual
corruption. According to Tanselle, the physical variant is a vessel
for the text, whose ideal form can only be realized by the editor. He
makes a distinction between "work" and "text":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of
it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in
sound waves... [In fact,] its medium is neither visual nor
auditory. The medium of literature is the words (whether already
existent or newly created) of a language; and arrangements of words
according to the syntax of some language (along with such aids to
their interpretation as pauses or punctuation) can exist in the mind,
whether or not they are reported by voice or in writing. Tanselle
16-17
#+END_QUOTE
Tanselle explains that physical act of inscription involves tools that
ultimately corrupt the pure ideas or intentions of the
writer. Therefore, every writer needs an editor that can help her
realize the ideal form of the text on paper. The editor, as someone
who is sufficiently distant from the creation and transcription of the
text, can objectively intimate its true intention. Therefore, the text
closest to the author’s intention is one scrupulously edited by a
textual scholar. Put another way, every author requires a thorough and
knowledgeable editor in order to most closely realize his intentions
on the page.

Toward the end of the 20th century, textual critics like Jerome McGann
and Donald F. McKenzie take another perspective on the effect of
inscription and tools on the textual material. McGann explores how
editorial practices, rather than aim for some ideal authorial version
of a text, might open up the ways that a text might be interpreted. He
builds off McKenzie's ideas about the influence of the social in
textual criticism. McKenzie's groundbreaking work, /Bibliography and
the Sociology of Texts/ (1999), studies how the materiality of texts,
includes sound and electronic media, takes on new forms and meanings
in in their reprinting and reproduction. McKenzie traces this
distribution, what he calls the "sociology" of texts, by examining the
social context that produced each witness, pointing out that "Every
society rewrites its past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if
they have any continuing life at all, at some point every printer
redesigns them” (25). Because the book is never a single object, but a
product of a number of human agencies and mechanical techniques that
are historically situated, no witness, regardless of scrupulous
editing by the critic, can represent an "ideal" version. McGann takes
these ideas and applies them to a digital editing environment, to
explore how electronic media might present the different variants of a
text. He explains that, because textual criticism in print format is
limited to linear and two dimensional form of the codex, this
criticism is limited to the same form as its object of
study. Paper-based editions, according to McGann’s experience, are
clunky and inadequate, and newer editions often “feed upon and develop
from [their] own blindness and incapacities” (McGann 2001, 81). By
contrast, digital editions can be designed for complex, reflexive, and
ongoing interactions between reader and text. Indeed, “[a]n edition is
conceivable that might undertake as an essential part of its work a
regular and disciplined analysis and critique of itself” (McGann 2001,
81). McGann explains that changing one’s view of the original
materials through the process of building the edition calls its
original purpose into question. McGann points out that his work on the
digital /Rossetti Archive/ brought him to repeatedly reconsider his
earlier conception and goals, asserting that the archive "seemed more
and more an instrument for imagining what we didn’t know” (2001,
82). 

Like books, digital media is also limited, but it holds potential for
the way it displays information. The technical experience of editing
electronic texts encourages the speculation on new potentialities
about its presentation. McGann introduces the term “quantum poetics”
to indicate the volatile potentiality for meaning contained in every
element of a literary text. He explains that, “Aesthetic space is
organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements
making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even reverse
themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete quantum
levels” (McGann 2001, 183). The meaning of particular words in a
literary text depends upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent
readings and pathways through that text, to the significance of
immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces, all of which
the reader can only process a limited amount. In its potentiality,
McGann asserts, “Every page, even a blank page... is n-dimensional”
(2001, 184). Accordingly, digital tools could expose literature’s
inherent potentialities by carving new paths across familiar texts. In
this way, McGann argues for tools that facilitate tactile and
intuitive engagements of texts within an environment that opens itself
up to multiple dimensions of reading.

This radical potentiality of a text's quantum poetics is a result of
the limitation of digital media, which creates a tranformation upon
literary material into a new form. McGann's work thus takes the
limitations of computation--the fixing and disambiguation of data--and
turns it into a vehicle for analyzing literary material. He, along
with Lisa Samuels, describe literary interpretation as performance, or
what they call "deformance." Deformance works by estranging the reader
from her familiarity of the text, and relies on the the volitality of
meaning of particular words that depend upon a multitude of factors,
from antecedent readings and pathways through that text, to the
significance of immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces,
all of which the reader can only process a limited amount. A
"deformative criticism" therefore distorts, disorders, or re-assembles
literary texts to discover new insights about its formal significance
and meaning. McGann and Samuels offer the example of reading a poem
backward, where “the critical and interpretive question is not 'What
does the poem mean?' but 'How do we release or expose this poem’s
possibilities for meaning?'" (2001, 108).
*** performative analysis with focus on apparatus

I now turn to the work of Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement, both of
whom have deep investments with traditions of textual scholarship,
particularly the scholarship of Jerome McGann, that has influenced
early experiments with digital humanities in English
departments. Although their approaches vary in their specific topics,
methods, and results, they are connected in an investment for, in the
words of McGann, "imagining what we don't know" (82).

Building off the humanistic approaches in textual scholarship and
bibliography, Bode reframes literary analysis as performative. Bode
incorporates insights from Karen Barad's feminist scientific
methodology to argue against representationalism, or "the idea that a
knowing human agent symbolically expresses – or represents – some
thing-in-the-world (that thing is unchanged by that expression, and
that expression is more available or apprehensible to the subject than
the thing itself) ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 2). Barad's work
intervenes in theoretical physics to argue how the researcher is
always implicated in the object of study, and she proposes a theory of
"agential realism," where objects in the world do not precede their
interaction, but rather, 'objects' emerge through particular
"intra-actions" (Barad 58). Bode brings Barad's point about the
assumption of representation from physics to computational modelling,
where she explains that "entities don’t pre-exist engagements but are
generated in an ongoing or emergent way, by those intra-actions"
("Data Beyond Represenation" par. 2). For Bode, what statisticians
value as “representativeness” or “reproducibility” isn’t as important
(within a humanities context) as the materiality of the
apparatus. Rather than attempt to secure a factual or objective status
of the data, we should double down on the material processes of using
our tools. Accordingly, Bode suggests that we approach literary
databases in performative terms, taking a self-conscious appraisal of
the tools of analysis, as "effects of material-semiotic engagements"
("Data Beyond Representation" par. 15).

In troubling the subject/object boundary, examining "how... we
inscribe the boundaries we often presume to represent," Bode offers an
example with her current project, /Reading at the Interface/, which
explores the ways that Australian literature has been characterized by
various "paratexts," or "writings about literature."  ("Data Beyond
Representation par 11.) The project explores paratexts across various
platforms, including academic journals, newspapers, /Goodreads/, and
/Librarything/, to see how they have represented the boundary of
"Australian Literature." Bode looks at how the process of data
collection makes a distinction between the main text and the
"paratext," or the metadata like title, author, and publication
information of the text. She is interested in how her inquiry
literally creates boundaries of what we understand to be "text" and
"paratext" in Australian literature. This activity indicates, for
Bode, how the researcher is intevening with the object of
analysis. Bode that she's "not interested in representing discussion
of “Australian literature” on Goodreads so much as in materialising
that platform in ways that cannot be separated from [her] categories
of analysis" ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 19). Her research
finds that an attention to the "apparatus," or the instrument of
analysis, is crucial in exploring the performative aspects of
inquiry. Drawing from a physics understanding, where "an apparatus is
a specific material configuration, including of physicists, wherein
certain properties become determinate, while others are excluded,"
Bode applies the figure of the apparatus to literary databases (Bode
"Data Beyond Representation, par. 24). Instead of looking at what is
being reproduced, she urges literary researchers to look at how human
engagement has entangled with and created the object of analysis.
 
*** play leads to discovery 

Tanya Clement's work with sound incorporates praxis, visualization,
embodiment, and play toward a theory of performantive criticism. She
uses figures and methods from audio analysis to reconsider the ways we
approach digitized text. In a project on text visualization, she puts
forth a theory of “play,” in which the critic "performs" the work,
much like the way that musicians interpret a musical score. She uses
the audio analysis tool "ProseVis" to visualize the prosodic elements
of Gertrude Stein's poetry, which creates dynamic spaces for the
reader to interact with the visualization. Using ProseVis, the reader
can navigate through the visualizations and manipulate the metrics for
analysis. Clement makes the analogy between musical scores and
quantitative visualizations to emphasize how both "create another
level of abstraction with which the interpreter engages" ("Distant
Listening par. 7). Clement points out that a musical score "is read,
but it is also meant to be played, to be spatialized in time and
embodied by voices (or instruments) within a certain physical and
hermeneutical context" ("Distant Listening" par. 10). She argues that
the same is true for visualizations of text: "One 'reads' a
visualization, but to 'play' the visualisation is to engage the
spatialized interpretation of that visualisation as an embodied reader
in a situated context within a specific hermeneutical framework
("Distant Listening" par. 10). The multiple levels of abstraction for
containing the "work" of the text multiply the levels of engagement
with that text. Clement's research takes this key finding from textual
scholarship and applies it to the critical process.

The unique affordance of digital environments, according to McGann,
Bode and Clement, is that they allow for numerable interventions upon
the textual object. Like a musical score, which "point[s] toward many
possible interpretive 'results' or readings," visualizaions can
provide a starting ground for different pathways of analysis ("Distant
Listening" par. 12). Human attention spans, rather than represent the
hurdle for computational methods to overcome, offer an opportunity for
re-imagining analysis as a process of deforming what we pay attention
to. The emphasis shifts from viewing text as something stable and
self-evident to something dynamic and subject to different
readings. As McGann speculates, engaging with texts on a computer
could be as intimate a process as engaging with them on paper. We
might use digital tools as “prosthetic extension of that demand for
critical reflection,” with which the reader is able to feel her way
through the text (18).


** queer performance & citationality  
*** overview
Distant reading can evolve by borrowing from key findings from queer
theory that allow it to embrace the performative/productive aspects of
quantification. In particular, Butler's idea of gender performativity
coheres with deformative reading. Butler describes performativity as a
repetative activity, constrained by regulatory norms, which produces
subjects. Although performativity regulates subjects toward
heteronormative practices, it can also be coopted into subversion. In
the process of repetition, subjects have the possibility of
resignifying meaning by producing it differently. This resignification
allows subjects to work within their limitations to resist dominant
structures while maintaining their own sense of exclusion without
being coopted. In other words, they can be in the system but not of
the system.

*** Butler's performative citation, subvert from within 

In her groundbreaking book, /Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity/ (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts
contemporary feminist theorizations about sex and gender; namely, that
sex is biological while gender is constructed; and that the gender, as
a construction, is an expression of the subject. According to Butler,
there is no such thing as a stable gender identity, or even a subject
that exists prior to gender expression. Rather, Butler argues that
gender is a performance--a series of repeated acts by which the
subject, in the ongoing enactment of gender expression according to
heteronormative regulatory schemas, emerges. Major criticism of this
work resists the idea that both sex and gender are discursively
produced, insisting upon the physicality of the sexed body as a basis
of identity. In /Bodies That Matter/ (1995), Butler responds to this
criticism by delineating the process of performativity, where what is
experienced as the physical body, its boundaries and its sexuality,
only materialize through the repetition or “citation” of cultural
norms. Her concept of "citation" emphasizes the iterability of the
performative practice, whereby each action "cites" or implicitly
signals an authorizing norm. According to Butler, performance consists
of this habit of citation, the ongoing process of submitting behavior
to a regulatory norm. Butler makes the general argument that body’s
materiality is discursive, that the “sexed body” is a residue or
"sentimentation" that emerges from the signification and
re-signification of whatever social power or understanding about sex.

In /Bodies that Matter/, Butler's central concern is to explore how
language and the body engage. She approaches this concern by
identifying the issue with representation: "Can language simply refer
to materiality, or is language also the very condition under which
materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Specifically, Butler wonders
whether language can indicate a body that has not yet been imbued with
meaning, a body "prior to signification" (6). She finds that language
cannot--for to refer to the body, language must first posit that body,
and in the positing, it assumes meaning. Therefore, the signification
of the body actually creates the body: "This signification produces as
an /effect/ of its own procedure the very body that it nevertheless
and simultaneously claims to discover as that which /precedes/ its own
action" (6). Butler thus claims that language works to /produce/
signification, rather than reflect a prior reality: "the mimetic or
representational status of language, which claims that signs follow
bodies as their necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the
contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue
performative" (6). Language cannot simply point to a reality, for in
the act of pointing, language actually produces that reality. So, in
the process of citation, which is the ongoing re-signification that
appeals to regulatory norms, subjects are always interpellated by a
discourse prior to their citing it: they cannot speak outside the
power that structures speech. However, in settling the issue of
language and representation, Butler isolates a productive quality of
language, which will be central to the ways that language offers a way
out of the significatory circle.

Amid this regulatory structure, however, lies the possibility of
resignifying sex/gender. Butler insists that resignification of these
citations is the way out of this significatory circle. Butler asks,
"What would it mean to cite a law to produce it differently, to 'cite'
the law in order to reiterate and coopt its power?" (xxiii). Because
language transcends a representative function, because it has the
ability to /produce/ meaning, language can be resignified toward
subversive usages. Butler offers an example in the resignification of
the term "queer," which has been transformed from a term of abjection
to one of empowerment. She explains that, every time an identification
is made, so is a repudiation, and "this disavowed abjection will
threaten to expose the self-grounding presumptions of the sexed
subject" (3). In identifying with heterosexuality, one repudiates
homosexuality, and homosexuality, in turn, remains a threat to the
identification. Butler proposes that one marshall this repudiation as
a resource in resignification: "The task will be to consider this
threat and disruption... as a critical resource in the struggle to
articulate the very terms of symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility"
(3). She explains that one recognizes this resignification in the word
“queer” which has been re-appropriated from signifying abjectness to
defiance. The term "queer," in its public assertion, "enacts
performativity as citationality for the purposes of resignifying the
abjection of homosexuality into defiance and legitimacy"
(xxviii). Each time the term is used, it draws from the domain of
abjection, the repudiation, in a way that re-signifies because it
fails to repeat the meaning loyally, because it signifies that meaning
differently. Repetition of the term to re-signify identification, to
the point where it loses its power. This is especially evident in
drag, where "the refusal of the law might be produced in the form of
the parodic inhabiting of conformity that subtly calls into question
the legitimacy of the command, a repetition of the law into hyperbole"
(82). For Butler, then, the central problem of being stuck in
performance is also the solution. Butler takes on language as
something that can be productive, that can resignify meaning, as the
option available to those who are trapped within the signification
system.

An exploration of Luce Irigaray writing style demonstrates how this
process of resignification can take place in language. According to
Butler, Irigaray's main task is to explore what has been excluded by
philosophy, which is the feminine. Irigaray uses the concept of
phallogocentrism, or that man, symbolized by the phallus, is the
center and focus of knowledge, as a lens for reading Plato and
Aristotle's discussion of form/matter or bodies/souls
binaries. Irigaray demonstrates how these binaries, which take the
category of "woman," associated with "matter" (materiality, the
mother) and set it subordinate to male "form" (mastering rationality)
actually erase the possibility of representing woman at all. In fact,
the binary that claims to represent the feminine as the subordinated
term in masculine/feminine binaries, actually "produces the feminine
as that which must be excluded for that economy to operate"
(10). Because "binary oppositions are formulated through the exclusion
of a field of disruptive possibilities"(10), the feminine is
"domesticated" (13). The nonfigured feminine remains excessive,
outside the terms of the binary:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
One cannot interpret the philosophical relation to the feminine
through the figures that philosophy provides, but, rather, she argues,
through siting the feminine as the unspeakable condition of
figuration, as that which, in fact, can never be figured within the
terms of philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is
its enabling condition. 12
#+END_QUOTE
What Butler calls the /excessive/ feminine is excluded, or cast out,
as "the necessary outside," which allows the /specular/ feminine to
take its place in the binary. According to Butler, we cannot know what
the feminine consists of without subscribing it to
phallogocentrism. If the feminine is outside the system, and cannot be
figured, how can it be known? Butler aptly questions, "For how can one
read a text for what does /not/ appear within its own terms, but which
nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own
legibility?" (11). For Butler, this is the key question--how do we
work with what we are given to express what is not there, what is
refused by the system of the visible?

The answer is through repetition and reworking--resignification
through performative citation. Butler explains that Irigaray achieves
this resignification by miming language: "she mimes philosophy... and,
in the mime, takes on a language that effectively cannot belong to
her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use citation as a strategy of
repeating what Plato says with the goal of undermining his authority:
"She cites Plato again and again, but the citations expose precisely
what is excluded from them, and seek to show and to reintroduce the
excluded into the system itself" (18). Through repetition, Irigaray
displaces the logic of phallogocentrism, introducing something
external to the system while remaining within its terminology. Butler
affirms that "Her miming has the effect of repeating the origin only
to displace that origin as an origin" (18). Her repetition is a way of
infiltrating the logic of phallogocentrism on its own terms. Butler
herself mimes what might have been Irigaray's internal monologue:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
#+END_QUOTE
Deception through resemblance; insubordination through subservience;
displacement through repetition--these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism.

For Butler and Irigaray, however, "radical and inclusive
representability is not precisely the goal" (25). Remaining /outside/
the logic of phallogocentrism is necessary for preserving the content
of the excluded feminine from being coopted into that logic. Butler,
in particular, hopes for a queer subjectivity that can never be
defined, and like the term "queer," for it "to remain that which is,
in the present, never fully owned, but always and only redeployed,
twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and
expanding political purposes" (173). Through performative citation,
Butler intends to preserve that which is excluded or unintelligible as
a resource for continual resignification, as "the point of departure
for a set of historical reflections and futural imaginings"
(173). For, Butler explains that, "to bring in every marginal and
excluded position within a given discourse is to claim that a singular
discourse meets its limits nowhere, that it can and will domesticate
all signs of difference" (25). Rather than aim for inclusion, one
ought to position the "necessary outside" as a target that is beyond
reach, as a fount for future subversions. This positioning allows us
to harness opacity and unintelligibility as a resource for resisting
the violence of this exclusion, using unrepresentability as a tool for
disruption. Only this language of performative citation can illuminate
the structure of the signifying power without also giving that power
the tool to fight that which is questioning its authority. Butler
explains that, "If there is a violence necessary to the language of
politics, then the risk of that violation might well be followed by
another in which we begin, without ending, without mastering, to
own—-and yet never fully to own—-the exclusions by which we proceed."
(25).


** TODO Queer Distant Reading
*** reading methods, revisited
In the section on reproducibility, I discuss how Underwood's analysis
on gender differences reproduces his assumptions about gender dynamics
as oppositional, as he readily admits: "this chapter has discovered
stable 'structural positions' only because it explores gender, for the
most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant Horizons/ 140). The the
binary structure reproduces itself from the initial assumptions to the
resutl. Like the fantasy of the falsifiable, the romance of
reproducibility arises from a desire to find coherence across literary
history, and thus aims for a method that can do so by abstracting text
as data to surface connections between them. Because reproducibility
aims for what Underwood describes as a "simple picture," it collapses
or flattens the complexity of data into workable units ("Machine
Learning" 98). What are the major trends of literary style across
time? How can our analytical models take in even more data, and
multiple perspectives, and process it into a legible visualizations?
Such questions tend to reproduce their own assumptions in the
output. The issue then becomes, how can we might move beyond
reproducing assumptions in our analysis

One answer is to shift the objective of analysis from the the
reproducible to the speculative. My intervention lies in teasing out
how existing paradigms for analyzing literary data and power
structures might combine to create a new method for text analyis. This
new method grapples with quantification that reduces or flattens data
by harnessing this reduction toward speculative ends. First, the field
of Textual Scholarship, which explores how electronic environments
faciliate the continued study of literary materials, offers Deformance
as an analytical method. This method attends to the ways that digital
environments for editorial scholarship transform the object of study
to surface new material for analysis. Second, the field of Queer
Studies offers the theory of Performativity, which is not a critical
method of analysis, but a paradigm for understanding how subjects
navigate compulsory significatory systems. The theory of Performance
posits that subjectivity emerges by subscribing to--or
"citing"--regulatory norms of behavior, like gender roles, and also
proposes that citational practices open the possibility for subversion
to norms through resignification. Despite their differences, both
deformance and performance rely on the ability for language to
resignifiy meaning through deconstruction and iterability. Both pay
attention to the productive qualities of language, which can be
redeployed toward creativity, rather than perpetuate "representations"
which obscure their significatory power by miming some prior citation.

The way that Bode describes her critical approach mirrors Butler's
explanation of the performative. Bode is drawing a distinction between
two approaches for literary criticism, two options for engaging with
literary material and phenomena. The first is "representationalist,"
in which data represents or expresses real objects and subjects in the
world. The second approach understands data "as part of the ongoing
materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events always arising
from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured" (Bode
"Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to Performative
Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a representationalist
approach toward language and materiality, in which language can
/refer/ to materiality as something that is prior, against the
performative approach, by which language works through repetition to
signify and resignify meaning:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
#+END_QUOTE
The alignment here between Bode and Butler indicates an intersection
between queer and digital processes, which center on the role of
language and data in conveying meaning. There is something
fundamentally productive about these phenomena, and not in the way
that they purport to represent some real quality or object in the
world. Rather, the productive aspect has to do with how they iterate
their material over and again in ways that are fundamentally creative.

*** Performance (performative citation) as a way of enacting
    Deformance (transformation).

      Each time we process a text in computation, we are submitting it to
      the governing code, a code that flattens the object, abstracting it,
      only computing part of it. 

	  See code from NLTK or Voyant, generate()?
	  http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/text.html#Text.similar

*** But at the same time, we can iterate over that code, to produce
    slightly different results. We are re-running the code. 

    Code as "protocol" - working through established networks 
    Code as "citationality" - repeating code to attain agency

    Butler is looking for the “exploit”, the way out of the
    system by using the system’s own rules. Using language and repetition
    to resignify what sexuality and proper sexual relations are.

    "The compulsion to repeat an injury is not necessarily the compulsion
    to repeat the injury in the same way or to stay fully within the
    traumatic orbit of that injury. The force of repetition in language
    may be the paradoxical condition by which a certain agency---not
    linked to a fiction of the ego as master of circumstance---is derived
    from the impossibility of choice… Paris is Burning might be understood
    as repetitions of hegemonic forms of power that fail to repeat loyally
    and, in that failure, open possibilities for resignifying the terms of
    violation against their violating aims" (83).

*** We are taking what has been reduced, reworking it into new
    configurations. These configurations present transformed
    understandings of our data, elements of the text.

    What do we find in Orlando? That man and woman are actually very
    similar? Yes and no.

*** Performatiave citation as queering distant reading: Deception
    through resemblance; insubordination through subservience;
    displacement through repetition--these are the tools available to
    the subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism.

    Reading for the enabling structures, and then playing with these
    structures by repeating the same processes over them. Iteration,
    interaction, creating new results are important. We are reading
    for that which is hidden, surpressed, which determines that which
    is visible.

*** The process reveals the hidden "enabling structures" of our
    analysis: our analytical method, and the structures by which we
    understand queerness (categories).

    This notion of displacement through repetition is applied back to
    text analysis to illustrate how the iterative process of analyzing
    text can surface new textual structures that re-signify certain
    elements of that text.

I'm playing around with voyant tools on Giovanni's Room, and realizing
that my movements are carefully guided by this impression from textual
scholarship of deformance. At every step I am deforming the text,
creating a new text, with new potentials for reading. 

This deformance is an iterative process. 

There's a dip in the word "don't" toward the end of the novel, in
section 9. But when we get get the contexts into its own text
submission, there's a rise in this same sector. What's going on? 

Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter
five, a spike that is surrounded with a dearth of don'ts. This
explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

This activity calls for closer attention to the area of the spike, and
its surroundings.

What if we read only the sentences with the word "don't" in them?

*** Altschuler and Weimar on reproducibility

--> reproducing something perfectly overlooks the ways that all
digital objects are unique, differentiated. Theory of textual
criticism which shows how ther are more interesting things to do then
create a digital "copy texte". 

This notion extends to digital humanist practitioners. 

they call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses" while maintaining that reproduction is
the highest value. They argue to "texture the humanities", pointing
out that much of DH prioritizes the visual over other senses --
"privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible"
(74). Rightly so, they argue, “The textured DH we call for here
acknowledges that we cannot study knowledge only abstractly, apart
from the senses, and that we cannot study literature, art, and history
without including the history of embodied experiences” (74-75).
- “Touch This Page! uses 3-D printed facsimiles of raised-letter text
  to inspire reflection on the assumptions most people make about
  which senses are involved in reading” (82).

But they elide the one interesting trajectory when they place
reproduction over remediation/deformance. They state their aims: “to
expand the sensory accessibility of archives for all users and to do
so through the digital reproduction---rather than the translation---of
tactile knowledge” (76). Case example of the perfect reproduction:
- A scenario where “users... can download a visual copy with
descriptive data, engage with the text in virtual reality, and create
their own textured facsimile. This technology once more makes possible
the tactile reading experiences for which this volume was designed and
promises library patrons a richer engagement with touch than most
archives can currently provide---even in person (85-86). 

The use case scenario makes the assumption that a reproduction is the
ideal form of textuality, despite their asserted aims for "diversity
of embodied experiences":
- “we must avoid tilting after the fiction of some ideal digital
  surrogate---like a virtual reality system that would flawlessly
  mimic original objects---lest we become digital Pierre Menards,
  expending extensive energy to improve our reproductions to discover,
  at last, that only the original perfects represents itself… Instead,
  we envision in our tactile futures multiple strategies that could
  not only open up access to varied experiences---past and
  present---but also diversity the ways embodied experiences structure
  our digital worlds” (86).
- in order to open up “multiple strategies” and diversity embodied
  experiences, we need a theory of text that is capacious enough to
  accept variation and transmediation.
- This argument overlooks deformance is a solution: the ways that
  creating new texts, paratexts, creates new objects of knowledge. It
  overlooks the performative, ala McGann, Clement.

In this view, digital becomes a means of optimization, efficiency,
total knowledge and understanding.

*** The debates about TEI illustrates this tension between the
“conservative” and the “creative” impulses in textual editing, and
shows how an encoding method that is highly structured can be used to
mark or explore moments of textual instability or ambiguity.

Web. 2001.

Electronic editing ought to capture what is inherently n-dimensional
about literary texts---to engage in the quantum poetics of each
textual detail.

*** Singer, Kate. “Digital Close Reading: TEI for Teaching Poetic
Vocabularies.” The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. 3,
May 15, 2013.

Using TEI to teach close reading finds that one can approach it to
engage individualized readings---marking moments of textual
instability rather than formal aspects. Given that the tool is
flexible enough, we do not have to agree on a schema, standardize a
schema, in order to use the tool to engage the incommensurable.

Horizon: Feminist Ontologies and the Problem of Gender.” Feminist
Modernist Studies. 1:3, 230-242. 2018.

What do we do when our tools won’t allow us to capture or convey
certain elements of the text? It turns out that the limitations of the
computer are actually a good indicator of things that maybe should be
left unresolved or unfixed---like gender ontology.

[fn:2] Potentially revise and deepen this section by linking to Barad
& Haraway on situated knowledges and feminist science: Being modular
in itself isn't bad, as long as you are aware of the ways that
modularity creates limitations/reductions of data. Modularity needs a
critical awareness of its own tools.

[fn:3] Her work also extends Michelle Alexander's ideas from /The New
Jim Crow/ (2010), which argues that modern society perpetuates racist
violence and segregation by criminalizing race through the war on
drugs and mass incarceration.

[fn:4] Andrew Piper's methodology, which he calls "bifocal" reading,
demonstrates how distant and close reading are used together, with
distant reading providing the context or framework that guides close
reading"“We are no longer using our own judgments as benchmarks... but
explicitly constructing the context through which something is seen as
significant (and the means through which significance is
assessed).... It interweaves subjectivity with objects” (Piper,
Andrew. Enumerations: Data and Literary Study, 2018, 17).

[fn:6] He measures the "gendering of words used in characterization"
("Machine Learning and Human Perspective" 95), that is, gender
portrayed in novels by women and in novels by men. The verticle axis
visualizes the representation of words by women, and the horizontal by
men, with positive numbers signifying overrepresentation of these
terms. So terms on the top right are words that are used often by men
and women writers, and terms in the upper left and lower right are
ones used most often by women and men, respectively.

[fn:7] Add a quote here from Laura Mandell on F/M categories?

[fn:8] Da's emphasis on the “reproducible” in CLS extends Franco
Moretti's originating call for a “falsifiable criticism”: both
advocate for a methodology that is as reliable and verifiable as the
social sciences. According to Moretti: “Testing” literary
interpretations be the same process as in scientific disciplines --
demanding that interpretations are “coherent, univocal, and complete,”
and are tested against “data” that appears to contradict it (/Signs/
21). (another quote: “The day criticism gives up its battle cry ‘it is
possible to interpret this element in the following way,’ to replace
it with the much more prosaic, ‘the following interpretation is
impossible for such and such a reason,’ it will have taken a huge step
forward on the road of methodological solidity” (/Signs/ 22).)

[fn:9] Drucker implicitly refers to the first chapter from Franco
Moretti's /Graphs, Maps, Trees/ (2007), throughout which Moretti
graphs novels by their publication date between 1700 and 2000 and
draws conclusions about the relationship between genre and generations
of readers.
