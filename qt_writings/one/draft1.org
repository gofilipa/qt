** chapter summary 
The burden of this chapter is to describe how to do text analysis, or
"distant reading," in a way that attends to queer concepts of gender
performativity, and how that method might leverage computational
processes to analyze literary material that expresses complex gender
ontologies. This chapter proposes a method for text analysis to study
the phenomenon of gender in Virginia Woolf's novel, /Orlando: A
Biography/ (1931). 

I begin the chapter by critiquing what I call "the fantasy of
falsifiable criticism," which contrasts traditional distant reading
practices with experimental methods that deconstruct social
categories. My own method of text analysis draws from these
deconstructive approaches to create a new way for understanding gender
ontolgies in quantitative form. For the middle portion of the chapter,
I draw connections between computer programming and gender
theory. First, I delve into python programming, focusing on the
structure of the ~for loop~ and processes for cleaning and
regularizing text, with the goal of bringing out the recursive quality
of running python code. Then, I dip into Judith Butler's concept of
gender performativity, which lends an understanding to the ways that
critical processes can subvert dominant structures through iteration,
or what she calls "performative citation." To wrap up this section, I
do a close-reading of my source text, Woolf's /Orlando/, to examine
the ways that gender is closely coordinated with the significatory
power of language throughout the novel. In the final section of the
chapter, I apply Butler's notion of displacement through repetition in
gender performativity back to text analysis to illustrate how the
iterative process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures
that re-signify certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with
my text analysis of gender in /Orlando/ to demonstrate how the terms
"man" and "woman" in that text are re-signified from their initial
binary structure into a plural understanding.


** intro

The novel /Orlando: A Biography/ (1928), by Virginia Woolf, famously
opens with an assertive gender designation followed by an immediate
qualification: “He--for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the
fashion of the time did something to disguise it—-was in the act of
slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters” (11). When
performing quantitative text analysis on this text, the standard tasks
of “pre-processing” the text evacuate the ways that gender is
unsettled in this sentence. In order to computationally analyze a
text, a process known as “distant reading” or “text mining” which
involves calculating, generating, and visualizing textual patterns,
the text must first be transformed into a computable format. This task
of pre-processing (also called “cleaning” or “normalizing”) strips the
original text of capitalized words, punctuation, “stop words” (such as
articles and prepositions), and inflections in word endings, all of
which are deemed to be semantically minor, in order to make the text
amenable to quantitative analysis. After pre-processing Orlando, the
following list of computable words, or “tokens,” remains in the first
sentence: 
#+BEGIN_SOURCE
‘could’, ‘doubt’, ‘sex’, ‘though’, ‘fashion’, ‘time’,
‘something’, ‘disguise’, ‘act’, ‘slicing’, ‘head’, ‘moor’, ‘swung’,
‘rafter’.  
#+END_SOURCE
Cleaning this text not only strips it of its pronouns, including the
gender assertion in the first word, “He.” It also cuts the em dash
immediately following this "He," which signals the entrance of a
narrator that layers this assertion with conspicuous certitude: "—-for
there could be no doubt of his sex…."

This chapter examines how quantitative text analysis works with
gender, using Woolf's /Orlando/ as a test case. Text analysis borrows
from quantitative methods in the social sciences to do analyses like
topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and logistic regression, which
involve tasks for identifying textual patterns, classifying textual
elements and semantic structures, and calculating probabilities across
text-based datasets. Though these methods differ in important ways,
they share a faith in using the speed of computation, which can
process very precise elements like word frequency or syntactic
patterns, to analyze large collections of textual data. This chapter
looks to moments where computational processes collapse or evacuate
the nuances of gender, sex, and sexuality in literary text. Such
moments engage what I call the "reproducible" methodologies in current
distant reading scholarship, which largely analyzes gender in text as
a binary system and reproduces this assumption in their results. To
resist such methods, I explore how distant reading practices might
borrow from the "iterativity" of gender theory in Queer Studies. Here,
I take Judith Butler’s concept of gender performativity as a basis for
modeling a new approach that uses text analysis to deepen the study of
gender in /Orlando/.


** the fantasy of the falsifiable

Because computers can process hundreds of texts at a time, "reading"
at much faster rates than humans, they offer critics an opportunity
for solving the problem of literary scale. This opportunity attracts
literary critics like Franco Moretti, Ted Underwood, among others, who
pose ambitious questions about literary history. According to Moretti,
the process of quantification involves steps that reduce or abstract
textual elements into computable form in ways that open the potential
for analysis: "fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall
interconnection" (/Graphs/ 1). [fn:4] Moretti, who is largely
responsible for popularizing the practice of "distant reading" in
English Studies contexts, explores how social and economic forces
impacts literary form in the development of the modern novel. His
purview extends to thousands of texts from about 1750 to the present
day--a database that would otherwise be too large and unweildy to
analyze though non-digital means. According to Moretti, the computer
not only enables large-scale analysis but creates a formal stucture
for understanding texts, whereby "distance ... is not an obstacle, but
a condition of knowledge" (/Distant Reading/ 48).

Underlying this desire for analyzing literature at scale is another
desire to shore up the reliance on critical subjectivity in literary
analysis. Moretti's early essay, "The Soul and the Harpy" (1983), lays
out the reasoning behind developing a new methodological approach for
literary criticism, which will eventually flourish into "distant
reading." Moretti's positioning in this essay betrays a deep suspicion
about the indulgence of critical subjectivity in analysis, which he
casts as a concern about current methods of literary criticism, which
he calls "a sort of cultivated accompaniment to reading" (21). By
this, he means that the analytical practices of contemporary literary
critics, which "revolve around concepts such as ‘ambiguity’ and the
like" will "always be pushed into multiplying, rather than reducing,
the obstacles every social science encounters when it tries to give
itself a testable foundation" (22). Moretti offers a caricature of the
"student" of literature to illustrate his critique:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The [student]--unless desirous of turning into that legendary figure
whose only pleasure lay in contemplating his own reflection--must
concentrate on the dissimilarities and ruptures: on what has been lost
and become irretrievably unfamiliar, and which we can 're-familiarize'
only by doing such violence to it that we distort the objective,
material consistency of every work which it is the task of scientific
knowledge to reconstruct and 'salvage'. 14
#+END_QUOTE
According to Moretti, literary criticism encourages the critic's
narcissism. Moretti's alternative methodology borrows from the
sciences to maintains the "objective, material consistency" of the
work by minimizing the potential for difference and
disagreement. Grounding the critical process on a more solid
foundation, Moretti calls for a "falsifiable criticism" that can
"test" literary interpretations (21). /Falsifiable/ here means that it
must be contestable--one must be able to imagine an alternative to
ensure hypothesis can be meaningfully tested. Falsifiable criticism
pursues interpretations as "coherent, univocal, and complete," where
the "results" can be compared with "data" which "appear contradictory
or inexplicable in the light of the hypothesis itself" (21). Moretti
here envisions a literary criticism that would steadily progress
toward irrefutable knowledge: "The day criticism gives up the battle
cry ‘it is possible to interpret this element in the following way’,
to replace it with the much more prosaic ‘the following interpretation
is impossible for such and such a reason’, it will have taken a huge
step forward on the road of methodological solidity" (22).

Moretti's falsifiable criticism eventually grows into "distant
reading," and particularly, "quantitative formalism," which attributes
the bulk of analytical work to computational and visualization
processes, and relegates the literary critic to the role of explaining
the results of the computer's analyses. The essays in his most popular
collection, /Distant Reading/, demonstrate the streamlining of his
critical method into a recursive process of posing hypotheses,
collecting and assembling data, and making inferences. The results are
often unexpected, and sometimes bring Moretti to reframe his
hypotheses. For example, in “Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles
(British Novels, 1740-1850),” Moretti plots book titles on a series of
graphs in order to explore how market forces influence the size and
content of the titles. He finds that titles are quite sensitive to the
market: "As the market expands, titles contract; as they do that, they
learn to compress meaning; and as they do that, they develop special
‘signals’ to place books in the right market niche” (204). Moretti's
incisive interpretation, which is borne by the various graphs of title
lengths over time, obscures the fact that it is, fundamentally, an
interpretation. A closer look at his language betrays the extent to
which he makes interpretative moves at every step:
#+begin_quote
in what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
/describe/ a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
/try to explain/ its causes; next, I /suggest/ how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I /make a little attempt/ at quantitative
stylistics, /examining/ some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
Moretti’s word choices diminish the subjective work of critical
analysis--he /describe[s]/, /tr[ies to explain/, /suggest[s]/ and
/make[s] a little attempt/, /examin[es]/. This language presents the
literary critic's work as an objective description of unproblematic
reality, as if his conclusions are supplementary to the graphs and
other visualizations. However, it is Moretti who poses the question,
inputs the data, and draws conclusions from the graphs. The computer's
ability to quantify textual data emboldens Moretti toward making
seemingly objective claims about literary history, all the while
diminishing his role as in analysis.[fn:23]

The faith in the "falsifiable," or the objectivity of quantitative
methods, even affects those who are critical of its use in literary
studies. For example, Nan Z. Da argues that quantitative methods,
which trade "speed for accuracy, and coverage for nuance," reveal a
"fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical tools that are used and
the objects to which they are applied," (620, 601). In her critique,
which cites "technical problems, logical fallacies," Da emphasizes the
lack of /reproducible/ results--that one researcher's process can be
reproduced by another researcher with identical output (601). She
demonstrates her point with an experiment in Topic Modeling, which
generates a number of "topics" from a textual corpus and is often used
to "speed-read" massive datasets to get a sense of their content. Da
attempts to verify the results of a Topic Modeling experiment by
replicating the process on her own machine, a replication which
fails. She concludes that, "if the method were effective, someone with
comparable training should be able to use the same parameters to get
basically the same results" (628-629). As Ben Schmidt points out,
however, Da in fact uses different parameters and software to run her
experiments, which explains her results. His critique points out that
Da, in taking down the quantification for literary studies, reinforces
its role in positivist inquiry:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Rather than pooh-pooh statistical reasoning, she elevates it by
incanting the language of quantification against itself. Far /more/
than anyone I’ve seen in any humanities article, she asserts that
scientists do something arcane, powerful, and true. [fn:6] 
#+END_QUOTE
Despite their vastly different committments and conclusions, Da and
Moretti align on the value that they place in the objective capacieis
of computational analysis. For both scholars, there is a implicit
faith that the computer can do some of the analytical work that has
been traditionally ascribed to the human.

With similar investments in studying literary history, Ted Underwood
works to visualize the "distant horizon" of literary trends across
centuries. Part of Underwood's project uses predictive data analysis,
in which a sample of data is used to make predictions about larger
groups of data, to study the way that gender markers in novels change
over time. This process involves using computer programs which are
"trained" by certain data sets to create new programs that can then
make predictions on other datasets. Underwood calls his approach
"perspectival modelling," explaining that "Since learning algorithms
rely on examples rather than fixed definitions, they can be used to
model the tacit assumptions shared by particular communities of
production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
93). Dan Sinykin claims that Underwood's ingenuity comes from
reworking statistical methods from "measurement to modelling." Rather
than simply report patterns from the data, Underwood uses
"perspectival modeling," in this case, logistic regression analysis,
to to model relationships between patterns, as a point on a continuum
between two perspectives. According to Sinykin, this method allows
Underwood "to leverag[e] the human prejudices built into modeling
toward humanistic ends" (par. 4).

Unlike Moretti, Underwood demonstrates an awareness about bias
contained with computational processes. He explains that "Machine
learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and rather
good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence used to
train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective" 92). In his
study of gender from the 18th to the 21st century, for example,
Underwood carefully asserts that these models suggest, not the truth
of gender ontology, but the approaches and choices made by those who
create the models. This project examines gender roles in novels by
using a model that predicts the the sex of a fictional character based
on the words associated with that character. Underwood explains the
process of training the predictive program:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on--excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. /Distant Horizons/ 115
#+END_QUOTE
This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles in
novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (/Distant Horizons/ 114). One of the many
explanations for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice
of writing becomes more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the
middle of the 20th century than it was previously (/Distant Horizons/
137). This fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about
men than women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline
in female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly
paradoxical conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while
the actual prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be
possible.

Underwood's methodology, however reinscribes the binary that he
attempts to deconstruct. First, his specific method for text analysis
is logistic regression analysis, which is made for modelling binary
variables. A logistic regression expresses information in the form of
a probability, often between yes/no, pass/fail, win/lose, etc. In
Underwood's case, the probability is male/female. The output therefore
conforms to this binary model. In other project where he similarly
measures the "transformations" of gender across time periods,
Underwood explains that simplification is necessary ("Machine Learnig
and Human Perspective" 93).[fn:10] In this project, Underwood admits
that he needs a "simple" model in order to bring into relation the
dynamics of gender (See Fig. 2). He explains:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
#+END_QUOTE
In aiming for simplicity, Underwood indicates that his initial
assumptions will affect the final result. Although he considers the
possibility that he finds a structural tension between gender "because
[he] explores gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition"
(/Distant Horizons/ 140), the assumptions behind the categories male
and female remain beyond his study. Collapsing of gender into a single
graph reifies the structural categories of male and female, rather
than deconstructing them. This process is replicated as the search for
meaning takes on other texts, imposing the same structure on new
material. Underwood himself states: "the data I can legally provide --
lists of word frequencies associated with each volume or fictional
character -- should allow intrepid readers to retrace the most
debatable parts of the argument. An argument that can be retraced in
this manner is 'reproducible'" (Underwood, /Distant Horizons/
173). Asking a machine to compute the conscription of gender as male
or female for the purpose of seeing how male and female roles in
novels change over time only creates a model of gender that is
"simple" enough to be computed.

Some text analysis practitioners, in contrast to Moretti and
Underwood, apply these or similar tools toward exploratory
methodologies, harnessing what Stephen Ramsay calls "the objectivity
of the machine" to do self-consciously subjective work (CITATION FROM
READING MACHINES). Ramsay's methodology, which he calls "Algorithmic
Criticism," take the constraints of computation as a liberating force
that allows the critic to reflect on her own phenomenal experience of
texts rather than seek definitive answers. Acknowledging that
quantitative analysis can reproduce assumptions, such methods avoid
falling into the fantasy of falsifiable criticism.

Going further than Ramsay, critics like Edwin Roland and Richard Jean
So apply exploratory methods to study some of the more slippery
concepts of social categories, such as questions of racial identity
and discourse. So and Roland explore the constructedness of racial
categories by experimenting with an algorithm that evaluates an
author's race according to the vocabulary used by the author. Applying
this algorithm to analyze a large corpora of novels by white and black
authors, they find that, black authors, in general, display more
varied vocabulary than white authors (66). From this they infer that
white authorship, as a category, only coheres against the variance of
black authorship. Whiteness, as they explain, /depends/ on the
characterization of blackness.[fn:8]

This quantitative exercise, rather than draw So and Roland toward
making general conclusions about race and authorship, points them
toward a peculiarity in the results: that the algorithm wrongly
categorizes James Baldwin's novel /Giovanni's Room/ (1956) as being
written by a white author. Apparently, the computer reads Baldwin's
use of the term "appalled" as proof of white authorsip. Going back to
examine this word in the text, So and Roland discover that this term
occurs only once, in the early scene where David (the narrator)
describes his strained relationship to his father: "I did not want to
be his buddy. I wanted to be his son. What passed between us as
masculine candor exhausted and /appalled/ me" (my emphasis; Rpt. in So
and Roland 71). Noting the connotations of whiteness in "appalled,"
which has the middle French root, "apalir," meaning "to grow pale," So
and Roland insightfully conclude that this term indexes an
intersection of gender with race: "the moment David develops a
troubled relationship to normative masculinity [as] also the moment he
becomes 'white'" (71). The computer's misclassification, as they point
out, reinforces this text's notorious elision of explicit references
to race, whereby racial markers are displaced in favor of an implicit
whiteness, as critics have observed in the scholarship on this
novel. Taking the computer's mistake as a starting point, So and
Roland's analysis thus contributes to the ongoing debate about the
complex relationship between race and sexuality in the novel.

In a sense, So and Roland are confronting the same problem as Da: what
is the effect of computational error in literary criticism? But
instead of writing off quantitative methods, they suggest an
interesting way out of the problem--to use the error as a starting
point for further analysis. Because race is a social construct, and
machines only impute meaning that is encoded into them, So and Roland
reason that machines are be ideal instruments for studying the
construction of race (60). This single computational error opens a
site for more daring leaps of speculation about how whiteness gestures
toward a troubled understanding of gender and potentially,
sexuality. In this way, computational methods, which work to "identify
and label objects," may operate in tandem with minority discourse
analysis, which "critique[s] and problematize[s] the very idea of
categories" (So and Roland 63). So, rather than being "fundamentally
mismatched," in Da's words, computational methods can be harnessed to
deconstruct social categories (Da 620).

**** TODO insert queerness and race
"Our reading’s destailization of the machine’s logic of white and
black arises directly from the novel’s expression of queerness. By
queering the machine’s color line, Baldwin’s novel challenges our
initial classifications of the novels as white or black, which had
necessarily effaced a more sophisticated, intersectional view of
social identity. In their current form, our data and model are not
robust enough to handle this kind of intersectionality" (So and Roland
72).

Just as quantification can probe racial categories, so it can
destabilize gender ones. Laura Mandell, for example, uses distant
reading to deconstruct what she calls the "M/F binary," which is the
reduction of gender into data. In her critique of Matthew Jockers and
Jan Rybicki, Mandell demonstrates that the M/F binary reifies
stereotypes in their premises, by "presenting conclusions about 'male'
and 'female' modes of thinking and writing as if the M/F terms were
simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently referential
and not discursively constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's examination
marshalls key findings from feminist theory, drawing from Judith
Butler, among others, to assert that gender is a socially constituted
category which is "constructed both by the measurer and the measured"
(par. 38).

To deconstruct gender, Mandell turns to genre, another category which
will allow scholars to see the reductive constitution of categories
generally. To study genre, Mandell uses the popular stylometry
measurement, "Burrow's Delta," which visualizes the "distance" between
writing styles by creating branches (or "deltas") between different
texts. Her experiment finds that the stylistic qualities of a female
writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, shares with those of male writers:
"Wollstonecraft’s sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble
[William] Godwin’s sentimental anti-Jacobin novels... whereas her
essays most resemble [Samuel] Johnson’s writings" (par. 29). Just as
quantification can deconstruct what So and Roland describe as "the
machine's initial binary understanding of white and black," so it can
deflate the M/F binary (So and Roland 68). Moving beyond
deconstruction, however, Mandell encourages rearchers "to experiment
with new taxonomies of gender," creating new categories that reflect
gender as a multiplicity (par. 37). Mandell emphasizes the potential
for complex data models to "break the strength of the signal" by
creating categories such as "'men writing as men,' 'women writing as
women,' 'women writing as men,' 'men writing as women,' 'unspecified
(anonymous) writing as men,'" and so on (par. 35). She points out that
the computer allows researchers to "animate numerical processes rather
than fixing their results as stereotype" (par. 7). It offers, in
Mandell's words, "parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very
complex reality” (par. 38).


Mandell's work opens up the consideration of how gender theory, in
particular, Butler's theory of gender performativity, might influence
computational analysis. However, her reading of Butler recapitulates
an assumption about performativity that Butler has been careful to
clarify in her writings since /Gender Trouble/. Mandell argues that
both gender and genre as a performance "are... highly imitable"
(par. 30), and asserts that "Anyone can adopt gendered modes of
behavior, just as anyone can write in genres stereotypically labeled
M/F" (par.30). However, as Butler emphasizes in her later work,
performativity is compulsory and habitual, a process, rather than a
singular act which can be imitated at will. Butler explicitly warns
against the interpretation that gender is decided by the subject, to
be put on and off at will like clothing, and instead asserts that
gender precedes and /constitutes/ the subject. Gender functions more
like a mechanism that allows the subject to emerge: "construction is
neither a subject nor its act, but a process of reiteration by which
both 'subjects' and 'acts' come to appear at all" (/Bodies/
xviii). 

This reading of Butler brings up the question of performativity, and
in what ways it can might align with computational processes. As So,
Roland, and Mandell demonstrate, the constraints of computation can
help point the bounds of social categories as a constructed
phenomenoa. In what follows, I demonstrate how gender, in particular,
and computation, share a high level of constraint, which can be
mutually reinforcing in text analysis. As Mandell points out,
"Computation enables complexity" (par. 36), and gender, like
computation, contains rules and protocols that build toward higher
levels of complexity. In the next section, I will examine how the
constraints of computation align with those of gender theory and
analysis.


** NLTK, Gender Trouble, Orlando

*** Python and NLTK

This section now turns to the programming language Python to get a
closer look at how text analysis works through constraint. We will
look into Python's syntax to examine the processes and protocols for
cleaning text.

To do common text analysis tasks, where text passed through an
automated seive to find patterns, many distant reading projects use
the Python programming language, which offers a number of custom
"libraries," or collections of code for specific tasks, such as
analyzing textual data. The most popular text analysis library in
python is the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), which contains useful
computational "methods" and "functions" that count, categorize, and
visualize textual patterns. One such method, ~concordance()~, will
return all the immediate words surrounding a chosen word. For example,
below is a concordance of the word "woman" from the text of /Orlando/,
which shows the context of the first 25 instances of this word in the
novel:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE

yed her cheeks scarlet . For the old woman loved him . And the Queen , who knew

#+END_SOURCE

This ~concordance()~ method is related in its process to another one,
~similar()~, which also uses word context to calculate its output. The
result for running ~similar~ on the word "woman" is the following:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
man moment night boy word world child pen ship door one room window
light little lady table book queen king
#+END_SOURCE

To compute the results of ~similar()~, NLTK first takes the context of the term from
~concordance()~, then it searches the text for other terms that
contain similar contexts. In this sense, the ~similar()~ method
searches the text for words that appear /similarly/ to the chosen
word. It is a useful strategy for getting a sense of which words are
treated in comaprable ways across the text.

In order to run methods like ~concordance()~ and ~similar()~, however,
the text needs to be ready for analysis. As illustrated in the opening
example in this chapter, the process of preparing a text for text
analyis always requires a reduction of data in which some semantic
value has escaped. In this example, "cleaning" the first sentence of
Woolf's novel, /Orlando/, strips it of its pronouns and punctuation
which has the effect of surpressing the gender qualification: "He–for
there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did
something to disguise it—-was in the act of slicing at the head of a
Moor which swung from the rafters" (11). After processing, the
following words remain:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
‘could’, ‘doubt’, ‘sex’, ‘though’, ‘fashion’, ‘time’, ‘something’, ‘disguise’, ‘act’, ‘slicing’, ‘head’, ‘moor’, ‘swung’, ‘rafter’. 
#+END_SOURCE

The emphasis on readability in Python's vocabulary and syntax makes it
a relatively straightforward programming language, where beginners may
intuit the gist of the code by simply reading it. For example, the
expression ~print(1)~ will display the number 1 when executed. The
below program sets a variable ~x~ to the number 1, uses an ~if
statement~ to check if the variable is set to the number one, and
prints the string ~x equals 1~ if the answer is affirmative:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python 
x = 1

if x = 1:
    print('x equals 1')
#+END_SOURCE

When analyzing text, Python works with data in the form of words, or
~strings~, contained within groupings called ~lists~. Then, Python
/iterates/ through the list, that is, it performs a similar task to
each item in the list. For this purpose, an expression called the ~for
loop~ consists of six words over two lines which instruct Python to do
something to each item in the list, in other words, to "loop" through
data, carrying out some specified action to each peice. A ~for loop~
that iterates through the first sentence of /Orlando/ would consist of

Here, the first sentence of the novel is saved as the variable,

each word in this sentence. The first line of the loop (~for word in

(~print(word)~) instructs the computer to display each word in the
sentence. Essentially, this loop will go through each item in the

will ~print~ or display that data.[fn:13] The the output will appear

These kinds of iterative computations, which are central to
programming tasks, are a core component of working with text. At a
very basic level, much of text analysis consists of iterating over
bits of text and doing something to each bit. In preprocessing, the
main tasks include tokenizing, cleaning, and regularizing the text,
which helps to eliminate pieces of text that will skew or slow results
of analysis due to their high frequency and low semantic
value. Tokenizing the text means separating the text into workable
units, or ~tokens~, that are easier to clean and regularize. Once the
text is tokenized, it can be stripped of capital letters, punctuation,
and what are called "stop words," which consist of prepositions,
articles, and related terms, such as "he," "for," "there," "be," "of,"
"the," and "did" in the above example. The following code block loops
through the text to remove punctuation and capital letters: 

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
lower_no_punct = []
for word in full_text:
    if word.isalpha():
        lower_no_punct.append(word.lower())
#+END_SOURCE

Here, it begins by creating an empty list, ~lower_no_punct~, where
words will be dropped after filtering through them. The next line
begins the ~for loop~, which iterates through each word in the
~full_text~ list of words. The third line, an ~if statement~ creates
the condition specifying alphabetic characters (containing no numbers
or punctuation), and if the word fulfills that condition, then it
passes to the fourth line, which will add that word to the
~lower_no_punct~ list. At the moment that this word is added to the
list, its letters will be transformed to lowercase format. The final
list, therefore, will contain words that are all lowercase and contain
no punctuation.

Using Python's brevity, we can accomplish the above with just one line
of code, which is known as a "list comprehension":

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
lower_no_punct = [word.lower() for word in tokens if word.isalpha()]
#+END_SOURCE

Reading from left to right, this expression first creates an empty
list, called ~lower_no_punct~. Then, for each word in the text, it
makes the word entirely lowercase, and if that word is alphabetic, it
will be added to the empty list. Expressions like this one condense
the processes and conditions contained within the previous block of
code into one line.

To remove stop words, for example, we can use another list
comprehension:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
no_stops = [word for word in lower_no_punct if word not in stops]
#+END_SOURCE

This expression takes each word in a list, in this case,
~lower_no_punct~, and checks to see if that word is also contained
within the list of stop words in ~stops~. If the word is /not/ a stop
word, then it will be added to a new list, ~no_stops~. Once this
filtering is done, the final list contains all lowercase words without
punctuation or stop words. For example:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafters']
#+END_SOURCE

After cleaning the text in this way, the next step is regularization,
which includes stripping the grammatical structure to get the word
root. One of these processes, called "stemming", involves cutting off
the endings from the word. For example, "rafters" will be stripped to
"rafter." In another process, called "lemmatizing," the computer will
look up each word, one by one, find its appropriate root, and then
revert to that root.

There are two aspects about the cleaning and regularizing process that
merit some attention: the first is recursion. The cleaning and
regularizing process is highly recursive, doing the same action to
each item to the list of words that make up the text. The logic of the
code reinforces this recursiveness, especially in the loop which
iterates through items in a list, doing the same thing to each item,
one by one. Additionally, the code's nested expressions reinforce
recursion, as each line specifies another action to be performed on
each word. For example, in the following code block, the first line
isolates a word from the list, the second line checks if that word
contains only alphabetic characters, and the third transforms that
word to lowercase. Each of the three lines performs an additional task
on the same word.

The second notable aspect about the cleaning and regularizing process
is reduction. These tasks of preprosessing text force words into
existing boxes, so to speak, in order to make them amenable to
analysis. The effect of this preprocessing therefore strips text of
some of its semantic meaning, which can be contained in capitalized
words, rhythms of language in stop words, inflections in word endings,
and so on. This is not to say that preprocessing ought to be avoided,
but that the researcher should be aware of how certain textual
reductions have the potential to affect meaning.

*** Butler and Gender Performativity

Now that we have a sense of Python, and its qualities of recursion and
reduction, I will turn to gender. In her groundbreaking book, /Gender
Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity/ (1990), Judith
Butler famously disrupts popular theorizations about sex and gender in
contemporary feminist thought: namely, that sex is biological while
gender is constructed; and that the gender, as a construction, is a
self-expression of the subject. According to Butler, sex and gender
are both social constructions, and there is no such thing as a stable
gender identity, or even a subject that exists prior to gender
expression. Rather, Butler argues, gender is performative--a series of
repeated acts by which the subject performs normative gender roles. In
her follow up book, /Bodies That Matter/ (1995), Butler further
delineates the process of gender performativity, where what is
experienced as the physical body, its boundaries and its sexuality,
only materialize through the repetition, or what she calls the
"citation," of gender norms. Her concept of "citation" emphasizes the
iterability of the performative practice, whereby each action
implicitly signals an authorizing norm.

As I will demonstrate, this theory of gender performativity has a lot
to lend to the study of computational text analysis. Before moving to
the details of Butler's theory, however, it is important to situate
her work within the context of second-wave feminism, and in
particular, with the work of feminist theorist Luce Irigaray, whom
Butler draws from. Writing in the 1970s and 80s, Irigaray takes
Jacques Derrida's concept of phallogocentrism--that man, symbolized by
the phallus, is the center and focus of knowledge--as a lens for her
critical analysis of the ways influential Western thinkers like Plato,
Aristotle, and Freud have discussed women and feminity; which she
claims "has always been conceptualized on the basis of masculine
parameters" (Irigaray, /The Sex Which Is Not One/ 23). In one essay,
Irigaray demonstrates how the binaries like form/matter and
bodies/souls, which associate "woman" with "matter" (materiality or
the mother) and set it subordinate to male "form" (rationality),
erases the possibility of representing woman at all. Butler points out
that this binary, which claims to represent the feminine as the
subordinated term in masculine/feminine binaries, actually "produces
the feminine as that which must be excluded for that economy to
operate" (10). In other words, the feminine which appears in the
feminine/masculine binary is a "domesticated" feminine, and the other
feminine, which is excessive, remains outside the binary (13). Butler
calls the "field of disruptive possibilities" which exist outside the
binary (13) the "necessary outside," which creates the conditions for
the binary to exist in the first place. She then describes what
Irigaray describes as the "unspeakable" feminine within this field:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
One cannot interpret the philosophical relation to the feminine
through the figures that philosophy provides, but, rather, [Irigaray]
argues, through siting [sic] the feminine as the unspeakable condition
of figuration, as that which, in fact, can never be figured within the
terms of philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is
its enabling condition. 12
#+END_QUOTE
Because phallogocentrism determines all expression, this outside
feminine is "unspeakable," remaining beyond figuration and
expression. Butler illustrates this quandry with a question: "how can
one read a text for what does /not/ appear within its own terms, but
which nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own
legibility?" (11). For Butler, this question--how to express what is
not there, what is refused by the system of the visible--will guide
her theorization of gender subversion, what she calls resignification,
through performativity.

The process of resignification begins with an examination of the
referential power of language. Butler first posits a body that exists
prior to signification, that is, a body that has not yet been imbued
with meaning through language. She wonders, "Can language simply refer
to materiality, or is language also the very condition under which
materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Butler finds that, in order
to refer to a body, language must first posit that body, and in the
positing the body, the body assumes meaning. Therefore, she reasons,
the signification of the body actually creates the body which it
appears to reference: "This signification produces as an /effect/ of
its own procedure the very body that it nevertheless and
simultaneously claims to discover as that which /precedes/ its own
action" (emphasis original; 6). Butler explains that "the mimetic or
representational status of language.... is not mimetic at all. On the
contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue
performative" (6). This point, that language produces the reality that
it claims to merely reference, has two crucial ramifications: first,
that subjects are always interpellated, and in fact brought into
subjectivity, by a discourse prior to their their participation in it;
and second, that this productive power of language nonetheless offers
a way out of the significatory circle.

For, amid this regulatory structure lies the possibility of what
Butler describes as /resignifying/ meaning. Because language
transcends a merely representative function, because it works to
/produce/ meaning, language can be resignified toward subversive
usages by "citing" what Bulter calls the "repudiated" meaning implied
by signification. Butler offers a rather famous example in the
resignification of the term "queer," which has been transformed from a
term of abjection to one of empowerment. "Queer" achieves this
resignification by harnessing its own repudiation, which is an implied
but "disavowed abjection [that] will threaten to expose the
self-grounding presumptions of the sexed subject" (3). In other words,
each time the term "queer" is used, it draws from that abjection which
is repudiated in every identification with heterosexuality. Butler
proposes that one "cite" this repudiation as a resource for
resignification: "to consider this threat and disruption... as a
critical resource in the struggle to articulate the very terms of
symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility" (3). Here, the concept
"citation" indicates an act of signification that draws from the
authorizing power. By citing the repudiated meaning, the term "queer"
"resignifyi[es] the abjection of homosexuality into defiance and
legitimacy" (xxviii). The resignification works because this
"performative citation" takes on the repudiation as its signification.

Because language is productive, it also offers a possibility of
resistance from within the signification system. Butler illustrates
how Irigaray achieves this resistance by performing the
phallogocentric language of the thinkers that she criticizes: "she
mimes philosophy... and, in the mime, takes on a language that
effectively cannot belong to her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use
performative citation as a strategy of undermining his authority
through repetition: "She cites Plato again and again, but the
citations expose precisely what is excluded from them, and seek to
show and to reintroduce the excluded into the system itself"
(18). Through repetition, Irigaray displaces the logic of
phallogocentrism, introducing something external to the system while
remaining within its terminology. Narrating what Butler imagines to be
Irigaray's thought process in an invigorating monologue, she lays out
the process of resistance:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
#+END_QUOTE
In this description of resistance within the cycle of signification,
where deception emerges from resemblance and insubordiation through
subservience, the key is repetition. Resistance looks like repetition,
a continual activity, the miming of the authorizing norm, which
displaces it by introducing what is outside the logic of
phallogocentrism.

Before moving forward, it is important to discuss some of the
criticism of gender performativity since /Gender Trouble/ was
published in 1990. It has had two significant critiques, one from the
field of Trans Studies and the other from political philosophy more
generally. Both of them concern Butler's concept of gender
performativity as a discursive phenomenon. Jay Prosser discusses the
mutual imbrication between Trans and Queer Studies: while Queer
Studies created the conditions for the emergence of Trans Studies, it
also depends on the figure of the transgender and cross-gender
identification in its theorizations. Beyond the common (and obvious)
critique Butler's use of drag in her famous description of gender
performativity in /Gender Trouble/, Prosser critiques Butler's
"deliteralization of sex" in /Bodies that Matter/, her follow-up to
/Gender Trouble/ (27). Prosser's critique--which applies to Queer
Studies generally--is that Butler's analysis elides the materiality of
the body. He points out that Butler reads the figure Venus from
/Gender Is Burning/ as transgressive only because she was not able to
attain her sex change, which would "make [her]self complete" (45). In
other words, Prosser points out that according to Butler, a sex change
that fulfills the desire for a masculine body would reinscribe
heterosexual hegemony. This "metaphorization of the transgender body"
demonstrates one crucial way that Queer Theory has subsumed
transgressive desires in cross-gendered identifications without
reckoning with the material body and its real and precarious
existence, as Venus's death illustrates (55).

The other critique concerns a logical inconsitency in the way that
Butler theorizes subjectivity. If the resistance to signification
comes from outside the cycle of signification, from where does that
external resistance emerge? Does it not imply a pre-discursive
identity or at least desire for resistance? Geoff Boucher writes that
Butler locates the potential for subversion "in a disembodied
intentionality that appears to stand outside of the
culturally-scripted subject positions that the individual occupies"
(115). He aptly questions: "Who (or what) decides 'how to repeat'? On
what basis is the decision to subvert power made?" (119).

These critiques are generative because they bring to the surface the
qualities of Butler's theory which makes it amenable to studying text
analysis. That is, these critiques surface aspects, such as executable
language and recursivity, respectively, which will help to understand
how programmatically analyzing text might align with the study of
gender.

*** Woolf's /Orlando/
I now turn to looking at gender in Virginia Woolf's novel, /Orlando: A
Biography/. For those who are unfamiliar with the text, /Orlando/ is a
fictional biography that follows the life of the eponymous
16th-century English nobleman as he undergoes a sex change and lives
into the 20th century as a woman. In what is perhaps the most salient
example of transgender narrative in the modernist era, /Orlando/
deploys a characterisitic modernist experimentation with language and
its limits to explore the instability of gender and gender norms. One
scene early in the novel, where the protagonist meets a russian
princess named Sasha, is the first of many where the problem of gender
is coordinated to a problem of language. For Orlando, the problem of
language and gender has to do with signification--he cannot resolve
how to express either one--which arises when he first sees Sasha:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
He beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him
with the highest curiosity. The person, whatever the name or sex, was
about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed entirely in
oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar greenish-coloured
fur. But these details were obscured by the extraordinary
seductiveness which issued from the whole person. Images, metaphors of
the most extreme and extravagant twined and twisted in his mind. He
called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an emerald, and a fox
in the snow all in the space of three seconds; he did not know whether
he had heard her, tasted her, seen her, or all three together.... A
melon, an emerald, a fox in the snow--so he raved, so he stared. When
the boy, for alas, a boy it must be--no woman could skate with such
speed and vigour--swept almost on tiptoe past him, Orlando was ready
to tear his hair with vexation that the person was of his own sex, and
thus all embraces were out of the question.
#+END_QUOTE
Sasha's skilled atheleticism and exotic manner of dress preclude an
unambiguous reading of gender. Orlando's use of seemingly arbitrary
metaphors, "a melon, a pinapple, an olive tree, an emerald, and a fox
in the snow," betray his attempt at gender signification that also
fails. His frustration here appears to feed his attraction, as with
each doubting moment Orlando appears more and more desperate, "ready
to tear his hair with vexation." 

As Sasha's probable gender oscillates between male and female
throughout passage, Orlando's desire crescendos. The narrative voice
and form of the sentences in this scene also shape the building
tension: the narration alternates interiority and description a in
free indirect discourse that jumps abruptly between narration and
interjections, to express a cyclical quality about Orlando's confused
mental state. The effect is to mirror with language the tortuous
thought process that Orlando undergoes as he guesses then doubts the
reality of Sasha's gender. While the tension thus mounts throughout
the passage, the relationship between gender and language comes to a
climax:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a
boy's, but no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those
breasts; no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from
the bottom of the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping a
curtsey with the utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past on
the arm of some Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a
standstill. She was not a handsbreadth off. She was a woman. 27-28
#+END_QUOTE
The tension finally ebbs as Orlando settles on Sasha's gender. The
unfolding phrases and clauses in the narration whittle into the simple
declarativity: "She was a woman." Through the use of figuration and
form, passage uses language to situate gender as something difficult
to grasp. At the same time that Orlando cannot place Sasha's gender,
he also cannot find the right words to describe her. If gender is
ambiguous, then language is also imprecise.

Much of the scholarship on this text explores its resistance against
normative concepts of identity and gender. The experimental use of
language and narrative form creates a narrative that is recalcitrant
against coherent understandings of gender and identity. Jane de Gay,
Jill Channing, and Christy L. Burns, for example, assert that Woolf
deploys imaginative elements, magical realism, and parody,
respectively, to resist realism and narrative expectations in her
fictional biography. De Gay aligns Woolf's writing with that of Walter
Pater and Vernon Lee as a "feminist historiography" that "rejected
Victorian patriarchal metanarratives" and instead "used the strategies
of fiction to bring history alive and make it live in the present" (de
Gay 71). In a similar vein, Burns and Channing both point out that
Woolf uses fantastical elements, in the former in the service of
parody, and the latter as part of magical realist writing, that
disrupt expectations of plot and narrative to challange the stability
of gender and identity. 

Doubling down on the role of langauge, other critics further emphasize
that the narration purposefully obfuscates any resolution about
concepts like gender, identity, and even race and
nationality. Victoria L. Smith asserts that "The fantastic content in
the novel is directly linked to the undecidability/impossibility of
the form of the novel and of the protagonist" (58). Various scenes,
like the one with Sasha ice-skating, "thematizes within the text how
representation or, rather more particularly, how literary language
finds itself at a loss" (Smith 68). According to Smith, the narrative
handles such scenes in a way that "offers a recuperation of the object
while bemoaning the inadequacy of language" (Smith 68). Pamela Caughie
zeroes in on the indeterminacy language, finding that it purposefully
precludes a straightforward understanding of sex and gender; as a
result, "sex cannot be separated from text, the grammatical from the
gendered" (Caughie 51). According to Caughie:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Orlando works as a feminist text not because of what it says about
sexual identity but because of what it manages not to say; not because
of what it reveals about the relation between the sexes but because of
what it does to that relation; not because its protagonist is
androgynous but because its discourse is duplicitous" (Caughie 41).
#+END_QUOTE
This argument, that /Orlando/'s subversiveness is s discursive one,
that it operates through language, has led to further critiques of its
political significance, particularly in its discourse on
nationalism. Jamie Hovey and Jessica Berman both explore how the text
challenges the boundaries of national identity through an implicit
critique of imperialism, a critique that emerges from the privileged
position of the white, British persective. Hovey remarks that
/Orlando/ is "an ambivalent articulation of English nationalism," a
nationalism that intersects with (and depends on) gender and race
(Hovey 394). Displacing the oppressive effects of nationalism to
racialized and sexually transgresive subjects, the novel "allows the
protagonist to pass as respectible and heterosexual" (Hovey
398). Bringing the question of transsexuality to the fore, Berman
argue that as a "trans text," /Orlando/ utilizes methods of marking
and categorizing bodies to interrogate the structures and boundaries
of nationality (Berman 218). According to Berman, "The transnational
situation as also intrinsically transgender" (Berman 218). Berman's
account harps on "the disruptive, critical energy of the prefix
'trans'" to unpack the concept of "nation" and "nationality" (Berman
220). 

Building from this work on the disruptive power of the narrative and
language, my reading finds that the resistance toward normativity
emerges most starkly in the challenge in representing reality. Moments
in the novel that convey this crisis in verbal signification, and
language's ability to represent reality, occur across two levels of
the story, that is, within the central action of Orlando's life, and
also within the narration itself, by the biographer who endeavors to
relate Orlando's life to the reader. The crisis is first declared at
the start of the novel, when the biographer reveals the difficulty of
using realistic language to give a truthful account of Orlando. When
discussing Orlando's physical appearance, the biographer distinguishes
his role, which is to tell the plain truth about Orlando, from that of
the poet, who must resort to figurative language to exaggerate aspects
about their subject: "Happy the mother who bears, happier still the
biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex
herself, nor he invoke the help of novelist or poet" (12). Rather than
invent metaphors or draw similitudes, the biographer's role is to
follow his subject "from deed to deed, from glory to glory, from
office to office," as a scribe (12). However, the committment to
straightforward description, begins to unravel with subtle
descriptions of Orlando's face that veer toward similitude, such as
the "peach down" of the lips, teeth of "an exquisite and almond
whiteness," the "tense flight" of the "arrowy nose," etc., and that
soon falls to full-fledged figuration:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit
that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed
to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling
of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were
his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we
rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit
a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer
to ignore. 12-13
#+END_QUOTE
Orlando, to put it simply, is too beautiful for literal
description. To describe "eyes like drenched violets," and "a brow
like a marble dome," the biographer must draw on the strategies of the
poet.

The crisis with signification on the outer level of the narrative also
occurs on the inner level, within Orlando's experience itself. When
his relationship with Sasha ends with deceit and desertion, he
succumbs to a long depression and struggles to peice together his
thoughts on truth and language:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
Every single thing, once he tried to dislodge it from its place in his
mind, he found thus cumbered with other matter like the lump of glass
which, after a year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with
bones and dragon-flies, and coins and the tresses of drowned women.

'Another metaphor by Jupiter!' he would exclaim as he said this (which
will show the disorderly and circuitous way in which his mind worked
and explain why the oak tree flowered and faded so often before he
came to any conclusion about Love). 'And what's the point of it?' he
would ask himself. 'Why not say simply in so many words--' and then he
would try to think for half an hour,--or was it two years and a
half?--how to say simply in so many words what love is. 'A figure like
that is manifestly untruthful,' he argued, 'for no dragon-fly, unless
under very exceptional circumstances, could live at the bottom of the
sea. And if literature is not the Bride and Bedfellow of Truth, what
is she? Confound it all,' he cried, 'why say Bedfellow when one's
already said Bride? Why not simply say what one means and leave
it?' 75
#+END_QUOTE
If in the previous passage the biographer resists the use of
figuration in his work, then here, Orlando interrogates the
truthfulness of figurative elements. The failure of the "dragon-fly",
the "bedfellow", and "bride" to signify what Orlando thinks about love
is only the beginning of such an interrogation: for the crisis of
signification extends to seemingly regular and exterior realities,
like the passage of time. And the following simile, "the lump of glass
which, after a year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with
bones and dragon-flies, and coins and the tresses of drowned women"
which evidently originates from Orlando, illustrates the way that the
outer (biographer's) narration blends into Orlando's interiority, a
blending that eventually casts into doubt on the consistency of
supposedly universal realities like the passage of time: "then he
would try to think for half an hour,--or was it two years and a
half?--." For Orlando and the biographer, the stakes of this crisis in
signification challenges the authority of language to convey truth, to
express the difficulty of "say[ing] what one means and leav[ing] it".

After Orlando's sex change, her issues with language begin to resolve,
and language suddenly takes on significatory power. In one scene,
Orlando watches a toy boat on a river in Hyde Park. When the boat
disappears then re-emerges on the other side of the wavelet, Orlando
suddenly realizes that language can take on extraordinary
significatory power, in which a "toy boat" can mean "ecstasy":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,' she repeated, thus enforcing upon
herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor
eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter; it's
something useless, sudden, violent; something that costs a life; red,
blue, purple; a spirit; a splash; like those hyacinths (she was passing a
fine bed of them); free from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or
care for one's kind; something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth,
husband I mean, Bonthrop: that's what it is--a toy boat on the
Serpentine, ecstasy--it's ecstasy that matters. 
#+END_QUOTE
In direct contrast to the earlier scene, where Orlando "despaired of
being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is
and fell into a deep dejection" (75), language now has the power to
signify. This concentration of meaning, in which "a toy boat" and
"ecstasy" are reduced to a common denominator of an ecstatic feeling,
elevates the potential for language to express. The symmetry of these
two episodes, which occur on opposite sides of the sex change, show
how Orlando moves beyond a disappointment in the limitations of
language for expression to a credibility in its power to mean.

As Orlando resolves her struggle with language, so does the
biographer. As the story progresses, the biographer increasingly drops
his pretension toward accuracy and boldly speculates upon events of
Orlando's life, for example, when Orlando first meets her lover Shel:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Shel, my darling,' she began again, 'tell me...' and so they talked
two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and really it
would profit little to write down what they said, for they knew each
other so well that they could say anything, which is tantamount to
saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things as how to cook an
omelette, or where to buy the best boots in London, things which have
no lustre taken from their setting, yet are positively of amazing
beauty within it. For it has come about, by the wise economy of
nature, that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language; the
commonest expressions do, since no expressions do; hence the most
ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and the most poetic is
precisely that which cannot be written down. For which reasons we
leave a great blank here, which must be taken to indicate that the
space is filled to repletion.
#+END_QUOTE
The use of the space break, which is meant to signify everything that
passes between Orlando and Shel and more ("it is filled to repletion")
functions by signifying nothing. According to critics like Katheryn
N. Benzel, this moment creates literal space for the reader to fill in
with her own interpretation of the scene. And Caughie points out, such
a device works "not because of what it says about sexual identity but
because of what it manages not to say," which reinfoces what she calls
the "double discourse" of the novel (Caughie 41). The text creates
oppositions, even paradoxes, which purposefully cannot be resolved,
such as "the most ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and
the most poetic is precisely that which cannot be written down." As a
formal device, the space break works to reinforce the capacity to
signify through language, even while, to repeat Smith's words,
"bemoaning the inadequacy of language" (Smith 68).

Such a reading of the figurative and formal elements of the novel
marks a site of an incisive critique from the perspective of Trans
Studies. For these elements--which are based in language and verbal
forms--are what allow Orlando to transgress the norms of gender and
sex in the novel. According to critics like Jay Prosser, Woolf's
experimentation with language and narrative form belies the physical
the embodied reality of transsexuality. He explains: "Orlando is not
about the sexed body at all but the cultural vicissitudes of
gender. As h/er narrative propels h/er through four centuries of
history, Orlando is free to move beyond h/er body--quite queerly, to
break through the limits of the flesh" (Prosser 168). By "the sexed
body," Prosser means the physical body, what Jack Halberstam describes
as the "literal, the real, the intractable flesh" which is bound by
the rules and boundaries of the physical and social world (Halberstam
314). That /Orlando/'s transgressiveness results from a play of
/language/ and /literary form/ that elides the specificity and the
lived reality of the "sexed body" precludes the novel from being what
Prosser would call a "transsexual" text. Rather, due to its
"ambivalence, a wavering around transition", "a transformation of
transition into new identity," its "easy androgyny," this text is
transgender (Prosser 169). As Caughie asserts, /Orlando/'s
transgressiveness comes from its discursive moves: "Far from defeating
sexual difference, as many feminist critics claim, Orlando enacts it,
enshrines it, exploits it, makes a spectacle of it, but as a playful
oscillation not a stable opposition" (Caughie 48). According to
Prosser, such strategies frames gender as a discursive (rather than
embodied) phenomenon.

Interestingly, Prosser's critique is what aligns this text more
closely with Butler's concept of gender performativity, particularly
in the way that language is used to produce (and and reproduce) gender
identity. In other words, a /discursive/ understanding of gender is
one that can be destabilized, distorted, and/or reformulated through
language. Caughie attributes the emergence of gender transgression in
this novel to experiments in figuration and narrative form:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Sexual identity is assumed in language...  Woolf brings out the
arbitrariness of that identity, the arbitrariness of language itself,
through Orlando's switching from one sex to the other, and from one
poetic language to another, as well as through the shifting of her own
rhetoric in this novel. Caughie 42
#+END_QUOTE
This text, with its "switching" and "shifting" discourse, which at
once asserts that language is deficient and that it overshoots the
mark, that it conveys plainness and poetry, implies that gender is
also a shifting, formal phenomenon. Like Butler, Caughie presents a
vew of gender as discursive.


** Queer Distant Reading

For this reason, I argue (and demonstrate below) how the study of
gender in the text can be accomplished through a quantitative analysis
of language. This quantitative analysis of language attends to gender
as an /iterative/ practice, rather than a /reproducible/ one which as
Underwood and Da demonstrate, reifies already existing conceptual
structures that bind social categories like gender. Underwood readily
admits that his work has "discovered stable 'structural positions'
only because it explores gender, for the most part, as a binary
opposition" (/Distant Horizons/ 140). This work, by contrast, turns to
the iteration--which cuts across both text analysis methods with NLTK
and Butler's theory of gender performativity--as the key for
understanding how a repetitive practice (like that of performative
citation) will reveal the expanding ways that gender is characterized
in /Orlando/. By shifting the understanding of reproducibility to
iteration, I apply the particular constraint of this tool, which is
repetition, to interpret elements of gender and sexuality in the text.

The idea of taking performativity into a methodology for digital
scholarship is not new. In particular, Katherine Bode's critical
approach, what she calls "performative materiality," draws from, not
Bulter's ideas about gender, but feminist scientist Karen Barad's
studies of quantum physics. This approach takes Barad's concept of
"agential realism," that objects in the world do not precede their
actions, but emerge through particular "intra-actions," and applies it
to her quantitative analysis of literary databases (Barad 58). Bode
brings Barad's "agential realism" from theoretical physics to explain
the /productive/ qualites of using computational analysis to study
literary databases. She approaches data as "effects of material-semiotic
engagements," where "entities don’t pre-exist engagements but
are generated in an ongoing or emergent way, by those intra-actions"
("Data Beyond Represenation" par. 15, 2). For Bode, attention to
performative materiality encourages scholars to focus on the material
processes of using their tools, rather than attempt to secure a
factual or objective status of data.

Though they are dealing with vastly different objects of study, Bode
and Butler both converge on their critique of reproducibility, or
"representationalist" methods, and the proposal of a
counter-methodology, which is "productive" through iteration. The
productive approach, according to Bode, understands data "as part of
the ongoing materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events
always arising from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured"
(Bode "Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to
Performative Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a
representationalist approach toward language and materiality, in which
language can refer to materiality as something that is prior, against
the performative approach, by which language works through repetition
to resignify meaning:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
#+END_QUOTE
This alignment between Bode and Butler centers on the productive power
of iteration in resignifying meaning. There is something fundamentally
productive about the process of iteration, which has nothing to do
with representing or re-representing some real quality or object in
the world, but with the way that iteration constitutes and
re-constitutes meaning.

In what follows, I use NLTK to analyze gender in /Orlando/. Drawing my
methodology from Butler's concept of performative citation, I compute
the words associated with "woman" and "man" within the text, with the
end goal of visualizing theses various associations in a network
graph, that is, a web of of "re-significations" of the words "woman"
and "man."  See Appendix A for a copy of the program code.

I begin the process by running the ~similar_words()~ method, which
takes a word, such as "woman," and returns the top words that appear
most similarly to that word in the text. The NLTK documentation
explains that similarity is computed by processing the words that
directly surround the given word, or its "context," and finding other
words that have similar contexts.[fn:1] It then returns a list of the
most frequent terms which have similar contexts to the given
word. Below are the words associated with "woman" and "man,"
respectively:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
> similar_words("woman")
'reached till friend word moment saw always could cried sailor wit
scarcely petticoat go servant conclusion'

> similar_words("man") 
'hurry father window tongue carriage still even countrywoman indulged
old fortune title ship writing fell become always love grown never'
#+END_QUOTE
	  
Each time a text is processed in computation, it is submitted to a
governing code. In this case of the ~similar_words()~ method, the code
enforces whatever conditions are contained within the function loop.
In the source code for the ~similar_words()~ method, there is an ~if
loop~ that instructs the program to search if the words in the context
also are associated with other words throughout the text.[fn:14] The
output therefore is directly constrained to the conditions in the
input.

However, there are ways to resist this control. Alexander Galloway,
who writes about the protocols, or control structures, which enable
network connections, explains that "Protocol is synonymous with
possibility" (Galloway 167). Galloway shows how protocols that drive
the internet connectivity, such as DNS and ISP, are instituted through
code, which must conform to a certain standard in order to
successfully communicate. For Galloway, resistance is possible by
manipulating the controlling structure by coopting its protocol. In
this case, I take the constraint of iterativity, which is contained
within the repetitive processes of the ~similar_words()~ method, and
feed new data into its computation. For example, when I feed the
output of the first computation to a new one, running
~similar_words()~ method again, it results in an exapanded list of
words that are associated with "woman" and "man." Below are the
results of running ~similar_words()~ under these conditions, taking
the output of the previous calculation for "woman" as new input:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
'come friend scarcely make happiness could say wisdom used thing grown
love shape dog wit saw always explain understood ran time prophet
indeed word stood met laughing sailor none able mixture allied woman
fly way year bird might known man toss sake thought reached cried
leave till account first petticoat fool would roused encumbrance
become window rust another madam london'
#+END_SOURCE

Below are the results for the same process, this time with the output
of for ~similar_words("man")~ as new input: 

#+BEGIN_SOURCE 
'title come need fault carriage tongue fortune death hungry passion
gloomy grown love written still must always saw exactly alone almost
perhaps take word matter determined orlando beautiful hear hurry woman
boy plump sens man soon little morning full strength whose two father
monstrously without ever would roused kinsman admit become old window
sink moment'
#+END_SOURCE

I may continue to run this ~similar_words()~ analysis, feeding the
output as new input, to gain an ever expanding sense of words which
are associated with each gender. However, to avoid what would
inevitably result in more and more shared terms between the two
genders, I slightly refine the the input before running the
computation again. Here, I filter out any words that are shared
between the categories of "woman" and "man". This filtering will allow
me to get a better sense of gender distinction in the text. After
filtering out shared words, and placing the unique associated words
for "man" and for "woman" into a new list, I run ~similar_words()~
again, with the following result for words associated "woman":

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
'among slipping launched child beneath shape new gently prophet indeed
true knee denied fasten bird hot found finger person bred leave nail
reflection character hid used month profit green since ran spoke omit
standing prayer bald frequent good heard scramble try bethink burst

upstairs went ribbon known catching case thought ask flung fool voyage
observed minute able people come ala raising gave laughing looked
third side allied fly might slept suddenly thousand going blackness

#+END_SOURCE

And the following result for "man":

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
'certain need fault wicket agitate hungry long passion talk circle
ague whatever written turn said explain treachery husband beast
remembered sleep longer pared filled tell princess deep beard tied
beautiful hear put mixture profound fumbled inborn rout immovable
plump awkwardness sens sofa whole mind morning imagine toss many made
iron blush round set whose raised first part monstrously without
needing taste story boyish admitted longed insisted looking glance
pushing'
#+END_SOURCE

In filtering out shared words between "woman" and "man," coming closer
to a sense of gender /distinctiveness/ in this text, it is important
to emphasize that gender descends from a binary system--from the
initial analysis of "woman" and "man." However, by iterating through
the code, the terms swell with significations that pluralize the
binary. This kind of iterative analysis, where the data is being
adjusted to increase the distinctiveness and complexity of the output,
works toward /resignifying/ the initial understanding of "woman" and
"man."

Like Butler's account of gender subversion, this kind of computational
analysis works through strict processes of repetition and iteration
toward resignification. Despite the tight constraints of these
computations, however, there is a freedom in the possibility of
manipulating the results and re-inserting them into the
workflow. Similarly to Galloway's description of hacking, where one
searches for a logical "exploit" contained within existing computer
code, the way to resist cooption into a system is by manipulating its
rules (Galloway 168). The rule here is iterativity which, as Butler
suggests, opens up the opportunity for subversion:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
The compulsion to repeat an injury is not necessarily the compulsion
to repeat the injury in the same way or to stay fully within the
traumatic orbit of that injury. The force of repetition in language
may be the paradoxical condition by which a certain agency---not
linked to a fiction of the ego as master of circumstance---is derived
from the impossibility of choice. 83 
#+END_QUOTE
Butler explains that the repetition of language is the condition
enables a certain agency to emerge. Through, repetition, dominant or
established meaning can be resignified. Taking Butler's concept of
"performative citation" as guidance, then, one may repeat the same
computation over and over again, with each new result expanding and
resignifying the initial understanding of binary gender.

[[./orlando/second_level_woman.png]]
[Visualization of gender distinctiveness in /Orlando/ using the python
networkx module]

The resulting image of gender distinctiveness in /Orlando/ shows how
the central term, "woman," has expanded over two levels of
similarity. Here, one can see that clusters form around certain words,
like "go," "could," "moment," and "wit," for example. Femininity is
associated at once with action, cognitive ability, and
conditionality. From a traditionally feminine point of view, some of
the terms appear fitting, such as "petticoat" and "friend," though
others appear less so, such as "sailor." Overall, this visualization
demonstrates an understanding of gender which is perhaps not
altogether unexpected, but certainly challenges any coherent
conception of "woman" in this novel. In doing so, it keeps gender
ontology unresolved. As Pamela Caughie and her team work to visualize
gender ontology the life narrative of Lili Elbe, one of the first
persons to undergo gender affirmation surgery, they point out that
some issues with ontology /should/ remain unresolved: "Confusion in
gender and sexual terminologies... is part of the experienceof gender
and sexuality in the modernist era, something to be realized and
negotiated in readings of the narrative" (239). As Caughie and her
team struggle to mark gender shifts throughout the text in a way that
accords with the constraints of the archival methodology, they realize
that the issue with categorizing gender doesn't need a
solution. Rather, computational processes and models might be used to
capture the taxonomic chaos of gender ontology.

Although one may attempt to formalize such a method, my goal is not to
build reproducible schemas and models for analyzing gender in
novels. Rather, I look to harness opacity and unintelligibility as
resources for resisting inclusion. As Butler affirms, "radical and
inclusive representability is not precisely the goal" (/Bodies/
25). Resisting the logic of phallogocentrism, the process of
performative citation--of displacement through repetition--is meant to
preserve that which is excluded or unintelligible as a resource for
continual resignification, as "the point of departure for a set of
historical reflections and futural imaginings" (Butler /Bodies/ 173).

*** Klein's Image of Absence
*** gio on voyant / nltk
    I'm playing around with voyant tools on Giovanni's Room, and realizing
that my movements are carefully guided by this impression from textual
scholarship of deformance. At every step I am deforming the text,
creating a new text, with new potentials for reading. 

This deformance is an iterative process. 

There's a dip in the word "don't" toward the end of the novel, in
section 9. But when we get get the contexts into its own text
submission, there's a rise in this same sector. What's going on? 

Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter
five, a spike that is surrounded with a dearth of don'ts. This
explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

This activity calls for closer attention to the area of the spike, and
its surroundings.

What if we read only the sentences with the word "don't" in them?

with distant reading providing the context or framework that guides
close reading"“We are no longer using our own judgments as
