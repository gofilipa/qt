** chapter summary 
The burden of this chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of gender performativity, and how
that method might leverage computational processes to analyze literary
material that express complex gender ontologies. I begin the chapter
by debunking what I call "the fantasy of falsifiable criticism," which
includes distant reading practicies by Franco Moretti and Ted
Underwood, constrasting their work with that of Richard Jean So and
Laura Mandell, whose methods emphasize deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I'm interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by creating new forms for understanding phenomena such as
gender ontolgies. For the middle portion of the chapter, I embark on
three "close-readings" of computer programming, gender theory, and my
source text, /Orlando: A Biography/ by Virginia Woolf. First, I delve
into python programming, focusing on the structure of the ~for loop~
and processes for cleaning and regularizing text, with the goal of
bringing out the recursive quality of running python code. Then, I dip
into Judith Butler's concept of gender performativity, which lends an
understanding to the ways that critical processes can subvert dominant
structures through iteration, or what she calls "performative
citation." To wrap up this section, I do a close-reading of Woolf's
/Orlando/ that examines the ways that gender is closely coordinated
with the significatory power of language throughout the novel. In the
final section of the chapter, I apply Butler's notion of displacement
through repetition in gender performativity back to text analysis to
illustrate how the iterative process of analyzing text can surface new
textual structures that re-signify certain elements of that text. The
chapter ends with my text analysis of Virginia Woolf's /Orlando/ to
demonstrate how "man" and "woman" in that text is re-signified from
its initial binary structure into a plural understanding 


** The fantasy of the falsifiable

This chapter examines how quantitative text analysis, which is a way
of analyzing textual data by counting its features or elements, such
as calculating word frequency or generating associative word pairs,
works with data about gender ontology. This examination probes the
central tension between "Queer Form," or figurative and narrative
forms by which gender is expressed [further elaborated in the
introductory chapter], and digital formats, where the logics
computation abstracts and transforms text into data. The process of
preparing a text for text analyis always requires a reduction of data
in which some semantic value has escaped. Common tasks like cleaning
and normalizing, where text is transformed into a format to make it
computable, constrain textual meaning by passing text through an
automated seive, filtering out its specificities. For example, in
order to be counted in a word frequency, text has to be rid of
elements like punctuation, articles, prepositions, and word
endings. Rather than attempt to recover semantic escape, I am
interested in exploring how possible approaches for quantification
might engage with gender as a complex phenomenon.

Distant Reading is a way of computing textual data by cleaning,
sorting, and counting textual elements, and can involve more advanced
processes like statistical modelling and machine learning. It borrows
from quantitative methods in the social sciences, applying them to
textual data, for example in word association, topic modeling and
sentiment analysis. Though they differ in their specifics, these
methods share a faith in using the speed of computation, which can
process very precise elements like word frequency or syntactic
patterns, to make calculations about how to categorize or organize
textual data. Moreover, they are part of a scientific method meant to
guide researchers in conducting experiments that prove or falsify
their hypotheses. The scientific method is a cyclical process, wherein
researchers make observations on a certain topic, formulate a
hypothesis, test the hypothesis with experiments, analyze and report
the results, bringing them toward new observations, hypotheses,
experiments, and conclusions.

Franco Moretti, who is largely responsible for popularizing the
practice of Distant Reading in English Studies contexts, greatly
influenced the ways that English scholars approach quantiative
methodologies. Because computers can process hundreds of texts at a
time, "reading" at much faster rates than humans, they offer critics
an opportunity for getting around the problem of literary scale, and
particularly attract critics like Moretti who pose ambitious questions
about literary history. Moretti's scholarship explores how social and
economic forces impact literary form in the development of the modern
novel. His subject is the vast swatch of modern literary history,
thousands of texts that would otherwise be too large and unweildy to
work with. He declares that "distance ... is a condition of knowledge"
(/Distant Reading/ 48). Other scholars follow a similar path. More
recently, Ted Underwood, in the field of Computational Literary
Studies (CLS), harnesses the power of quantification and machine
learning to glimpse what he calls the "distant horizon" of literary
trends across centuries[fn:3]. Some recent developments in distant
reading combine with close reading methods, as critics will use the
results of quantitative analysis to identify key moments from the text
that merit closer attention.[fn:4]

I begin with Moretti, because it is important to examine where the
impulse for reading distantly emerges in his work. In Moretti's early
essay, "The Soul and the Harpy" (1983),[fn:5] he divulges a key motive
in developing his methodological approach, which will eventually
flourish into "distant reading." Underlying Moretti’s methodology is a
deep concern with finding a way to ascertain the effect of historical
forces on literary form. But the current practices of literary
criticism present methodological obstacle. In this early essay,
Moretti characterizes literary criticism as "a sort of cultivated
accompaniment to reading – to the reading we are doing here and now,"
("The Soul and the Harpy" 21). By this, he means that the analytical
practices of contemporary literary critics, which "revolve around
concepts such as ‘ambiguity’ and the like," will, according to
Moretti, "always be pushed into multiplying, rather than reducing, the
obstacles every social science encounters when it tries to give itself
a testable foundation" (22). To illustrate the practices of current
literary criticism, Moretti distinguishes between the historian and
the student of literature:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The [student] – unless desirous of turning into that legendary figure
whose only pleasure lay in contemplating his own reflection – must
concentrate on the dissimilarities and ruptures: on what has been lost
and become irretrievably unfamiliar, and which we can 're-familiarize'
only by doing such violence to it that we distort the objective,
material consistency of every work which it is the task of scientific
knowledge to reconstruct and 'salvage'. 14
#+END_QUOTE
According to Moretti, the great danger in literary criticism is the
encouragement of narcissistic tendencies in researchers, whose attempt
to "re-familiarize" the object of study does it "violence". Moretti's
proposed method therefore would take a scientific approach that
maintains the "objective, material consistency" of the work. Here,
Moretti proposes a mode of critical inquiry that borrows from the
sciences to minimize the potential for difference and
disagreement. Grounding the critical process on a more solid
foundation, Moretti calls for a "falsifiable criticism" that can
"test" literary interpretations, much like a social science ("The Soul
and the Harpy" 21). /Falsifiable/ here means that it must be
contestable -- one must be able to imagine an alternative, to ensure
that the hypothesis can be meaningfully tested. Falsifiable criticism
would pursue interpretations as "coherent, univocal, and complete,"
where the "results" can be compared with "data" which "appear
contradictory or inexplicable in the light of the hypothesis itself"
(21). He envisions a literary criticism that will slowly but steadily
progress toward irrefutable knowledge of literary objects: "The day
criticism gives up the battle cry ‘it is possible to interpret this
element in the following way’, to replace it with the much more
prosaic ‘the following interpretation is impossible for such and such
a reason’, it will have taken a huge step forward on the road of
methodological solidity" (22).

Moretti's falsifiable criticism eventually grows into "distant
reading," and particularly, "quantitative formalism," which quantifies
literary form into visual formats like graphs and diagrams. Moretti's
quantitative formalism attributes the bulk of analytical work to
computational and visualization processes, and relegates the literary
critic to the role of explaining the results of the computer's
analyses. The essays in /Distant Reading/ increasingly demonstrate how
his critical method streamlines into the neat, recursive processes of
hypothesis, collecting and assembling data, and inference. The results
are often unexpected, and sometimes bring Moretti to reframe his
hypotheses. For example, in “Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles
(British Novels, 1740-1850),” Moretti plots book titles on a series of
graphs in order to explore how market forces influence the titles. He
explains that "the title is where the novel as language meets the novel
as commodity" (181). He finally concludes that titles are quite
sensitive to the market: "As the market expands, titles contract; as
they do that, they learn to compress meaning; and as they do that,
they develop special ‘signals’ to place books in the right market
niche” (204). This is an exciting interpretation, which is borne by
the various graphs of title lengths over time, but a closer look at
Moretti's language obscures the extent to which his critical process
involves interpretation at every step:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
/describe/ a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
/try to explain/ its causes; next, I /suggest/ how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I /make a little attempt/ at quantitative
stylistics, examining some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
This language presents the literary critic's work as an objective
description of unproblematic reality. Additionally, although his
speculations are provocative, Moretti presents them as supplementary
to the graphs. Moretti’s diminishing language--he /describe[s]/,
/tr[ies to explain/, /suggest[s]/ and /make[s] a little
attempt/--belies the nature of his intervention. After all, it is
Moretti who poses the question, inputs the data, and draws conclusions
from the graphs. The computational ability of the computer emboldens
Moretti to make larger claims about literary history, all the while
diminishing his role as in analysis. His approach almost appears to
aim toward reproducing analysis to the point of automation.[fn:23]

With the rise of digital methods like distant reading, the faith in
falsifiable criticism also grows, and even dominates the thinking of
those who are generally critical of distant reading in literary
studies. For example, Nan Z. Da, in her critique of scholars like
Underwood, argues that quantitative methods, which belong in
scientific methodologies, are ill-suited for literary studies. She
accusses Ted Underwood and other distant reading practitioners for
trading "speed for accuracy, and coverage for nuance" (620). Of her
many gripes with quantitative methods, which include "technical
problems, logical fallacies," and a "fundamental mismatch betwen the
statistical tools that are used and the objects to which they are
applied" (601), she emphasizes the lack of /reproducible/ results, the
idea that one researcher's process can be reproduced by another with
identical output. She demonstrates this lack of reproducibility with
an experiment of Topic Modelling, which is the processing of large
texts in order to generate a number of "topics" within the
corpus. Researchers often use Topic Modelling as a way of
speed-reading a massive corpus to get a sense of what it is about
without having to read the text in full. Da attempts to verify the
results of a Topic Modelling experiment by replicating the process on
her own machine, a replication that fails. She concludes that, "if the
method were effective, someone with comparable training should be able
to use the same parameters to get basically the same results"
(628-629). Keeping in mind that topic modeling will return different
results with even slightly different parameters,[fn:6] it is important
to note that Da places a faith in reproducibilityas as a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of quantitative methods.

This kind of reproducible criticism is where Moretti's fantasy of the
falsifiable leads. Despite their vastly different committments,
scholars like Moretti align with Da on the faith that they place in
the analytical capacities of the computer: Moretti in seeking a
falsifiable method; and Da in suggesting that CLS methods fail in
their goal to resemble the social sciences. In both cases, there is a
implicit faith that the computer can do some of the analytical work
that has been traditionally ascribed to the human.

This reproducible approach blocks out other kinds of connection to
text. Other approaches, by contrast, looks at distant reading for how
it might attend to some of the more slippery concepts of social
categories such as race gender. In order to address marginalized
aspects of identity, in a way that does not reproduce our assumptions,
we have to ask questions that do not assume that we already know the
kind of thing we are looking for.

One example of distant reading explores how to handle questions of
racial identity and discourse in novels. Richard Jean So and Edwin
Roland use machine learning to explore the constructedness of racial
categories by experimenting with an algorithm that evaluates an
author's race according to the vocabulary used by the author. When
they look more closely into these results of using the algorithm on a
large corpora of novels by white and black authors, they find that it
reveals different levels of variance in words traditionally attributed
to white and black authors: while novels by white authors are
distinguished by a low variance in this vocabulary, novels by black
authors show a greater variance in vocabulary (66). They conclude that
white authorship, as a category, only coheres against the incoherence
of black authorship. In other words, they find that whiteness
/depends/ on the characterization of blackness.[fn:8] 

So and Roland explain that this quantitative excercise is more useful
for what it teaches us about quantitative approaches, rather than what
it teaches us about race. They decide to explore an error that wrongly
categorized James Baldwin's novel, /Giovanni's Room/ (1956), as being
written by a white author. So and Roland point out that this
misclassification recalls a critical debate about this text's
notorious elision of explicit references to race, whereby racial
markers are displaced in favor of an implicit whiteness. One of the
words in /Giovanni's Room/ that influence its categorization as a
white-authored text is the term "appalled." So and Roland point out
the connotations of whiteness in "appalled," which has the middle
French root, "apalir," meaning "to grow pale" (71). They discover that
this term occurs only once in the text, in the early scene where David
(the narrator) describes his relationship to his father. Here, David
rues his father's friendliness: "I did not want to be his buddy. I
wanted to be his son. What passed between us as masculine candor
exhausted and appalled me" (Rpt. in So and Roland 71). They
insightfully conclude that the word "appalled" in the text marks "the
moment David develops a troubled relationship to normative masculinity
[as] also the moment he becomes 'white'" (71). Taking the computer's
mistake as a starting point, their analysis thus contributes to the
ongoing debate about the the complex relationship between race and
sexuality in the novel.

So and Roland assert that, while "Race is a category that escapes
measurement or simply renders it untenable," the machine is an apt
tool for studying this category" (60). In a sense, So and Roland are
confronting the same problem as Da: what is the effect of
computational error in literary criticism? But rather than write off
quantitative methods, So and Roland suggest an interesting way out of
the problem: use the error as a starting point for further analysis,
which probes the constructedness of gender ontology. Because race is a
social construct, and machines only impute meaning that is encoded
into them, than it stands to reason that machines might be ideal
instruments for studying the construction of race. Computational error
becomes an opportunity for exploring the encoding of racial
identity. Looking more closely at the specific results of this
analysis, like the function of the term "appalled" in /Giovanni's
Room/, they can make more daring leaps of speculation about how
whiteness, while displacing blackness, also gestures toward a troubled
understanding of gender and potentially, sexuality. So and Roland
assert that: "If the general class of the misclassified points to the
erosion of the machine's initial binary understanding of white and
black, a close analysis of a single misclassified text can reveal what
precisely motivates that ontological undoing" (68). Thus they turn the
what Da describes as the "fundamental mismatch between statisical
tools that are used and the objects to which they are applied" into a
point of interrogation (601). So and Roland emphasize that
computational methods, which work to "identify and label objects," can
operate in tandem with minority discourse analysis, which "critique[s]
and problematize[s] the very idea of categories" (63). In this case,
the algorithm allows researchers to interrogate how whiteness as a
category depends on the contrast of blackness as "other." So, rather
than being "fundamentally mismatched," the machine and minority
discourse are particularly suited for one another, as the machine uses
highly constructed and reductive method that allows practitioners to
deconstruct social categories.

The example with "appalled" is totally idiosyncratic--the word occurs
once through the entire novel. But paying attention to error upends
the expectations of reproducibility. The researchers run a
computation, look for an error, and use that error as an opportunity
to learn about the ways that categories are constructed. They are
using computers in an unintuitive way, computing for indeterminacy.

One prominent distant reading practitioner, Ted Underwood, studies the
way that gender markers in novels change over time. Underwood uses
machine learning for statistical modelling analysis, in which a sample
of data is used to make predictions about larger groups of data. In
other words, he uses computer programs "trained" by certain data sets,
to create other programs that can then make predictions on other
datasets. He then visualizes the results of his model. Underwood's
goal is to explore how effective computers are at analyzing certain
textual elements based on previous analyses. Highly aware of how his
data can carry certain assumptions, he calls his approach
"perspectival modelling." He explains that, "Since learning algorithms
rely on examples rather than fixed definitions, they can be used to
model the tacit assumptions shared by particular communities of
production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
93). In a review of Underwood's work, Dan Sinykin writes that "Against
the purported objectivity of algorithms, he leverages the human
prejudices built into modeling toward humanistic ends" (par. 4).[fn:9]

One of Underwood's projects examines gender roles in novels from the
18th century to the 21st century by using a model that predicts the
the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated with
that character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on--excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. /Distant Horizons/ 115
#+END_QUOTE
In simplest terms, the program studies some given adjectives
associated with a male or female character in order to make
predictions about other characters' genders. Inevitably, the resulting
output is always determined by this initial input. Underwood carefully
asserts that these models suggest, not the truth of gender ontology,
but the approaches and choices made by those who create the models:
"Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and
rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence
used to train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
92). 

This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles in
novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (/Distant Horizons/ 114). 

The graph below shows a steady overlapping of words traditionally
associated with women, such as "heart," with words typically
assoicated with men, like "passion," toward the middle of the 20th
century. 

One of the many explanations for this result, Underwood reasons, is
that the practice of writing becomes more commonly pursued as a male
occupation in the middle of the 20th century than it was previously
(/Distant Horizons/ 137). This fact, coupled with the tendency of men
to write more about men than women, suggests why less women writing
would led to a decline in female characters. This explains how
Underwood's seemingly paradoxical conclusion, that gender roles become
more flexible while the actual prevalence of women dissapates from
fiction, might be possible.

NOT THIS GRAPH!
[[./img/Underwood.png]]

There are two important things to point out about Underwood's
analysis. First is that his specific method for text analysis is
logistic regression analysis, which is made for modelling binary
variables. A logistic regression expresses information in the form of
a probability, often between yes/no, pass/fail, win/lose, etc. In
Underwood's case, the probability is male/female. The output therefore
conforms to this binary model. Second, underpinning his methodology,
there is a larger issue with the question that Underwood poses. From a
critical gender perspective, Underwood's question imposes the very
structure that he is attempting to deconstruct. In other project where
he similarly measures the "transformations" of gender across time
periods, he explains that simplification is necessary ("Machine
Learnig and Human Perspective" 93). Underwood admits that he needs a
"simple" model in order to bring into relation the dynamics of gender
(See Fig. 2).[fn:10] He explains:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
#+END_QUOTE
In aiming for simplicity, Underwood underestimates the extent to which
his initial assumptions will affect the final result. Although he
considers the possibility that he finds a structural tension between
gender "because [he] explores gender, for the most part, as a binary
opposition" (/Distant Horizons/ 140), he neglects to consider how the
collapsing of gender into a single graph perpetuates the structural
categories of male/female and the assumptions behind such a
category.[fn:11] The issue is not just with the assumptions at the
outset which reproduce the result, but with the guiding question of
the entire project, which is not about deconstructing gender, but
about reifying it. Asking a machine to replicate the conscription of
gender as male/female for the purpose of seeing how male and female
roles in novels change over time only creates a model of gender that
is "simple" enough to be computed.

How does simplifying the concept of gender contribute to our study of
it? Underwood's "simple" model recalls with what Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick
describes as "a binary mode of thinking," which searches for what
might affirm or deny the point of interrogation. Sedgwick explains
that this process creates a formula for literary analysis by which
reading becomes a mechanical practice of searching for what is hidden
or absent which will finally explain some latent meaning in the text
(Sedgwick Touching Feeling 12). Then, This process is replicated as
the search for meaning takes on other texts, imposing the same
structure on new material. Underwood himself states: "the data I can
legally provide -- lists of word frequencies associated with each
volume or fictional character -- should allow intrepid readers to
retrace the most debatable parts of the argument. An argument that can
be retraced in this manner is 'reproducible'" (Underwood, /Distant
Horizons/ 173). He continues, "If my conclusions hold true in
different subsets of the literary past, they are not just reproducible
but 'replicable'" (Underwood, /Distant Horizons/ 174).

Laura Mandell explores solutions for approaching the reduction of
gender as data, into what she calls the "M/F binary."[fn:12] Mandell
demonstrates how the M/F binary is reified "by presenting conclusions
about “male” and “female” modes of thinking and writing as if the M/F
terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently
referential and not discursively constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's
examination marshalls key findings from feminist theory, drawing from
Judith Butler, among others, to assert that gender is a socially
constituted category, a "performance" that can be historicized. She
illustrates the guiding power of the M/F binary in her critique of
Matthew Jockers and Jan Rybicki, finding that they essentialize gender
by relying on stereotypes in their premises.[fn:7] Mandell uses
stylometry, as well as word-frequency analysis, and topic modeling to
examine gender in writing.[fn:24] Topic modeling, as explained above,
is the generation of categories or "topics" about text. Mandell uses
the popular stylometry measurement, "Burrow's Delta," which visualizes
the "distance" between writing styles by creating branches (or
"deltas") between different texts. Specifically, Mandell's analysis
focuses on the "most frequent, little words (“a,” “of,” “the”), as
well as keywords."

Mandell suggests that quantitative methods can open up the way we
deconstruct our understanding of quantification and gender. She points
out that gender, which is "constructed both by the measurer and the
measured," is never just about gender, but contains multiple
assumptions. To demonstrate how gender is "constructed," she poses a
counter experiment with genre, which finds that genre analysis cuts
across the gender binary. She comapres the stylistic qualities of a
female writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, against two male writers,
William Godwin and Samuel Johnson, revealing that: "Wollstonecraft’s
sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble Godwin’s sentimental
anti-Jacobin novels... whereas her essays most resemble Johnson’s
writings" (par. 29). Wollenstonecraft's writing resembles both male
and female writing, depending on the genre. To analyze the highly
constructed category of "gender," then, one must also consider genre:
"separating gender from other markings (genre, era of composition) is
not possible: historical time and genre are not incidental to, but
constitutive of, gender" (par. 35).

Admitting the constructed nature of gender allows researchers "to
experiment with new taxonomies of gender" (par. 37). Most usefuly,
Mandell's work points out how the computer is ideal for drawing
attention to the multiplicity of gender. The potential for complex
data models potentially allows researchers to "break the strength of
the signal" in the M/F binary by creating new categories, such as
"'men writing as men,' 'women writing as women,' 'women writing as
men,' 'men writing as women,' 'unspecified (anonymous) writing as
men,'" and so on (par. 35). Moreover, her emphasis on visualization
and movement inform how one might "animate numerical processes rather
than fixing their results as stereotype" (par. 7). The dynamicity of
computation, which allows one to run data iteratively, feeding new
inputs into new results, complicates any straighforward understanding
of the M/F binary. Mandell explains that “Computer screens... afford
the fluid exploration of parameters and taxonomies, through which many
sorts of experiments can be tested: interactive visualizations can
give us not objective answers rooted in aggressively reductive
oppositions, but parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very
complex reality” (par. 38).

However enlightening Mandell's deconstructive approach, she does
overlook a crucial aspect about gender--that it is highly constitutive
of subjectivity. The similarities that Mandell draws between gender
and genre evacuate how gender is /constitutive/ of the
subject. Borrowing from Butler, she argues that both gender and genre
as a performance "are... highly imitable" (par. 30), and asserts that
"Anyone can adopt gendered modes of behavior, just as anyone can write
in genres stereotypically labeled M/F" (par.30). Here, she takes
Butler's points about gender as a performance in /Gender Trouble/ too
literally. As Butler clarifies in her later work, performativity is a
/process/ which is compulsory and habitual, rather than a singular
act. Crucially, Butler asserts that gender /precedes/ and
/constitutes/ the subject and explicitly warns against the
interpretation that gender is decided by the subject, to be put on and
off at will like clothing. Rather, according to Butler, the subject
/is produced/ by gender; gender is more like a mechanism that allows
the subject to emerge: "construction is neither a subject nor its act,
but a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and 'acts' come
to appear at all" (/Bodies/ xviii). This is not to say that Mandell is
wrong about gender being constructed, but that her assumption, that
"categories such as gender are being constructed both by the measurer
and the measured" misses an important point about the way that gender
constitutes subjectivity (par. 38). According to Butler, the subject
only emerges as an effect of gendered performance. Therefore, to
analyze gender, one might look at the ways that it constitutes and
constrains subjectivity.

I emphasize gender being constitutive because this quality has a
generative parallel to computation. As Mandell points out,
"Computation enables complexity" (par. 36). And computation, like
gender, is also highly constrained, containing rules and protocols
that govern the way that text is processed and analyzed. As So and
Roland demonstrate with the categories of white and black authorship,
the constraints of computation help point out the bounds of social
categories as a constructed phenomenoa. While the work of So and
Roland is essential for bringing together quantitative and critical
race discourses, it also doesn't give enough credit to the ways that
/computers/, in presenting formalized schemas of race, /transform/
data toward speculative ends. Additionally, however, computation might
work within the fram eof speculation. This kind of work would explore
the contraints of gender and computation as /enabling constraints/. As
Underwood acknowledges, computational methods are well suited for
speculative inquiries: "the point of numbers in social science is not
to impose determinism but to acknowledge uncertainty" (Underwood,
/Distant Horizons/ 186). If we are going to analyze gender, we might
consider how it constitutes and constrains other elements in the text.


** Deformance and Performance: NLTK, Gender Trouble, Orlando

*** Python and NLTK

This section now turns to the programming language Python to get a
closer look at how text analysis works through constraint. We will
look into the material specificity of text analysis, to examine how it
works, and through what processes and protocols.

Many distant reading projects use a text analysis tool called Python
to do computational analysis of textual data. As a general purpose
programming language, Python is applicable toward many tasks and
projects, from publishing websites, to managing and analyzing large
data sets (of textual and numeric data), to deep learning and
artificial intelligence. The emphasis on readability in Python's code
vocabulary and syntax make it a relatively straightforward programming
language that is easier to pick up than other comparable
languages. Most beginners can jump into the python syntax and intuit a
sense of the code simply by reading it left to right. For example, an
expression called the ~for loop~ consists of six words over two lines,
and that instructs Python to do something to each item in a group of
data. In more technical terms, the ~for loop~ offers a mechanism for
iterating (or "looping") through data, and carrying out some specified
action to each peice of data. The ~for loop~ consists of the following
expression:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
#+END_SOURCE

The first line of code specificies the data (~hello~), and the
second line (~print(letter)~) instructs the computer to print each
letter in the word. Essentially, this loop will go through each item
in the data, in this case, each letter in the word ~hello~, and it
will ~print~ or display that data.[fn:13] The the output will appear
thus:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
h
e
l
l
o
#+END_SOURCE

These kinds of iterative computations, which are central to
programming tasks, are a core component of working with text. At a
very basic level, much of text analysis consists of iterating over
bits of text and doing something to each bit. 

A major benefit to a popular programming languages like Python is that
users have developed a number of custom "libraries," or collections of
code for specific tasks like web scraping, data analysis, and text
analysis. In text analysis, there are a number of libraries for
Natural Language Processing (NLP), or the processing of linguistic
data into computational formats. The most popular NLP library in
python is the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK). This library comes
packaged with a corpus of texts that are ready to analyze, like Herman
Melville's /Moby Dick/ (1851) and Jane Austen's /Sense and
Sensibility/ (1811). Researchers can use NLTK methods like
~tokenize()~ or ~lemmatize()~, allowing them to process a text from
its oringal format, often a ~string~, or alphanumeric characters in
sequential order, into a "clean" or regularized form. NLTK also
contains useful analytical methods such ~similar()~, which will
generate a list of words that appear in similar contexts to the chosen
word, or ~concordance()~, which will return all the immediate words
surrounding a chosen word. For example, below is a concordance of from
Austen's /Sense and Sensibility/ for the word "woman":

#+END_SOURCE

This tool allows users to examine the context surrounding the chosen
word, "woman." In other words, we see some of the text that comes
immediately before and after the chosen word. This ~concordance~
method is related in its process to another one, ~similar~, which also
uses word context to calculate its output. The result for running
~similar~ on the word "woman" in /Sense and Sensibility/ are the
following:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
man way year moment word men letter friend person gentleman living
situation part lady wife child time thing little day
#+END_SOURCE

To compute terms with ~similar()~, NLTK first takes the context of the
term from ~concordance()~, then it searches the text for other terms
that contain similar contexts. In this sense, the ~similar()~ method
searches the text for words that appear /similarly/ to the chosen
word. It is a useful strategy for getting a sense of which words are
treated in comaprable ways across the text.


In order to run methods like ~concordance()~ and ~similar()~, however,
the text needs to be ready for analysis. This requires a series of
preprocessing tasks like tokenizing, cleaning and regularizing the
text. Tokenizing the text means separating it into units like words
and punctuation. Tokenizing the text transforms a ~string~
(alphanumeric sequence) of characters into workable units, or
~tokens~, which is easier to clean and regularize. NLTK offers a
method for tokenizing: ~nltk.word_tokenize()~. Running this method on
the text of Virginia Woolf's /Orlando/ turns the novel into a list of
words and punctuation. The following is the first sentence of the
novel in tokenized format:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE 
['He', '--', 'for', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'no', 'doubt', 'of',
'his', 'sex', ',', 'though', 'the','fashion', 'of', 'the', 'time',
'did', 'something' 'to', 'disguise', 'it', '--', 'was', 'in','the',
'act', 'of', 'slicing', 'at', 'the', 'head', 'of', 'a', 'Moor',
'which', 'swung', 'from','the', 'rafters', '.' ]
#+END_SOURCE

Once the text is tokenized, then it can be cleaned. Cleaning the text
involves stripping it of capitalized letters and punctuation, such as
"--" and ",", and removing what are called "stop words," or
prepositions, articles, and related terms. In this example, stop words
include "he," "for," "there," "be," "of," "the," and "did."
Punctuation and stop words are often removed because tend to skew or
slow results of analysis due to their high frequency and low semantic
value. Using python's brevity, we can clean and remove punctuation and
capital letters with just one line of code:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
lower_no_punct = [word.lower() for word in tokens if word.isalpha()]
#+END_SOURCE

Reading from left to right, this expression first creates an empty
list, called ~lower_no_punct~. Then, for each word in the text, it
makes the word entirely lowercase, and if that word is alphabetic
(meaning it contains no numbers or punctuation), it will be added to
the empty list. Python expressions like this one, which are contained
within brackets on a single line, are called "list comprehensions."
The variable that stores the final data (~lower_no_punct~) is set to a
list comprehension that specifies what to do for each word in the
text. This expression is a kind of condensed loop, which goes through
each item in a list of items (such as each word in a text) and does
something to that item. The same expression can be written in expanded
form by making use of nested structures. For example:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
lower_no_punct = []
for word in tokens:
    if word.isalpha():
        lower_no_punct.append(word.lower())
#+END_SOURCE

Here, we begin again by creating an empty list, ~lower_no_punct~, into
which we will drop our words after filtering through them. The next
line begins our ~for loop~, which iterates through each word in the
~tokens~ list of words. The third line creates the condition to have
only alphabetic characters in our ~lower_no_punct~ list. If the word
passes that condition, then we go to the fourth line, which will add
that word to the list. At the same time that this word is added to
this list, all the letters will be transformed to lowercase
format. The final list will contain words that are all lowercase and
contain no punctuation.

Next, we will remove stop words. To do this, we can use another list
comprehension:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
no_stops = [word for word in lower_no_punct if word not in stops]
#+END_SOURCE

Similarly to the above example, this expression takes each word in a
list, in this case, ~lower_no_punct~, and checks to see if that word
is also contained within the list of stop words in ~stops~. If the
word is /not/ a stop word, then it will be added to a new list,
~no_stops~.  Once this is done, we can take a peek into the first
several words on the cleaned text. We are now left with a list of
words that are all lowercase, without punctuation or stop words:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafters']
#+END_SOURCE

After cleaning the text in this way, we can move on to regularization,
which includes lemmatizing. Lematizing is the process of stripping the
grammatical structure to get the word root. In some cases, this
involves cutting off the endings, or affixes, from the word, for
example, "rafters" will be stripped to "rafter." In other cases,
however, it involves looking up a word in a reference to find the
appropriate root. After running the lemmatizer through our text, the
first sentence appears thus:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafter']
#+END_SOURCE

There are two aspects about the cleaning and regularizing process that
merit some attention: the first is recursion. The cleaning and
regularizing process is highly recursive, doing the same action to
each item to the list of words that make up the text. The logic of the
code reinforces this recursiveness, especially in the loop which
iterates through items in a list, doing the same thing to each item,
one by one. Additionally, the code's nested expressions reinforce
recursion, as each line specifies another action to be performed on
each word. For example, in the following code block, the first line
isolates a word from the list, the second line checks if that word
contains only alphabetic characters, and the third transforms that
word to lowercase. Each of the three lines performs an additional task
on the same word.

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
for word in tokens:
    if word.isalpha():
        word.lower()
#+END_SOURCE

The second notable aspect about the cleaning and regularizing process
is reduction. These tasks of preprosessing text force words into
existing boxes, so to speak, in order to make them amenable to
analysis. The effect of this preprocessing therefore strips text of
some of its semantic meaning, which can be contained in capitalized
words, rhythms of language in stop words, inflections in word endings,
and so on. That preprocessing potentially strips meaning from words
doesn’t mean that it ought to be avoided, but that the researcher
ought to be aware of how certain textual reductions have the potential
to affect meaning. For example, the novel /Orlando/ opens with this
assertive gender designation, followed by an immediate qualification
of this designation, which is expressed entirely in stopwords and
punctuation. The removal of stopwords from the opening sentence strips
the immensely meaningful first word "He," which asserts the gender of
the protagonist. It also cuts the following em dash, which leads to an
interruption that immediately qualifies the previous assertion "--for
there could be no doubt of his sex--." In preprocessing, such details
would be read as semantically void and would be subsequently removed
from the data.

*** Butler and Gender Performativity

Now that we have a sense of Python, and its qualities of recursion and
reduction, I will turn to gender theory. Here I examine gender theory
for how it operates in order to find parallels with the Python
programming language. My goal is to explore how these two might be
used to analyze gender in text.

In her groundbreaking book, /Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity/ (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts
popular theorizations about sex and gender in contemporary feminist
thought: namely, that sex is biological while gender is constructed;
and that the gender, as a construction, is a self-expression of the
subject. According to Butler, sex and gender are both social
constructions, and there is no such thing as a stable gender identity,
or even a subject that exists prior to gender expression. Rather,
Butler argues that gender is performative--it is a series of repeated
acts by which the subject enacts gender by "citing" heteronormative
regulatory schemas. It is through this process of /enacting/ gender
that the subject emerges. In her follow up book, /Bodies That Matter/
(1995), Butler further delineates the process of gender
performativity, where what is experienced as the physical body, its
boundaries and its sexuality, only materialize through the repetition
or “citation” of cultural norms. Her concept of "citation" emphasizes
the iterability of the performative practice, whereby each action
"cites" or implicitly signals an authorizing norm. According to
Butler, performance consists of this habit of citation, the ongoing
process of submitting behavior to a regulatory norm.

From Butler's theorization of performativity, I want to highlight how
language and the body engage. This occurs when Butler wonders whether
language can indicate a body that has not yet been imbued with
meaning, a body "prior to signification" (6). She asks, "Can language
simply refer to materiality, or is language also the very condition
under which materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Butler finds that
language cannot refer to a pre-existing materiality--for to refer to
the body, language must first posit that body, and in the positing, it
assumes meaning. Therefore, she reasons, the signification of the body
actually /creates/ the body: "This signification produces as an
/effect/ of its own procedure the very body that it nevertheless and
simultaneously claims to discover as that which /precedes/ its own
action" (6). Rather than reflect a prior reality, language actually
works to /produce/ signification. Butler's point here draws from
feminst theorist Luce Irigaray who argues that language in fact
creates knowledge, as in her famous statement about female sexuality,
which "has always been conceptualized on the basis of masculine
parameters" (Irigaray, /The Sex Which Is Not One/ 23). Butler explains
that "the mimetic or representational status of language.... is not
mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one
might even argue performative" (6). In other words, language produces
the reality that it claims to merely reference. So, in the process of
citation, which is the ongoing re-signification that cites regulatory
norms such as gender norms, subjects are always interpellated by a
discourse prior to their citing it. This productive quality of
language will be central to the ways that language offers a way out of
the significatory circle.

For, amid this regulatory structure, in which the subject comes into
being by continually citing the norm, lies the possibility of
resignifying that citation. Because language transcends a
representative function, because it has the ability to /produce/
meaning, language can be resignified toward subversive usages by
citing what Bulter calls the repudiated signification. Butler offers
an example in the resignification of the term "queer," which has been
transformed from a term of abjection to one of empowerment. "Queer"
achieves this signification by harnessing its own repudiation, which
Butler explains is implied by every identification, a "disavowed
abjection [which] will threaten to expose the self-grounding
presumptions of the sexed subject" (3). In effect, by identifying with
heterosexuality, one repudiates homosexuality, the "Queer," which
remains as a threat to the identification. Butler proposes that one
marshall this repudiation as a resource in resignification: "to
consider this threat and disruption... as a critical resource in the
struggle to articulate the very terms of symbolic legitimacy and
intelligibility" (3). Here, the concept of "citation" is crucial, for
each signification "cites" or draws from the authorizing power. One
can cite a norm in order to disrupt the significatory power of that
norm. So, the term "queer," in its public assertion, "enacts
performativity as citationality for the purposes of resignifying the
abjection of homosexuality into defiance and legitimacy"
(xxviii). Each time the term is used, it draws from the domain of
abjection, the repudiation, in a way that re-signifies because it
fails to repeat the meaning loyally, because it signifies that meaning
differently. For Butler, then, the central problem of being stuck in
the cycle of signification is also the solution. Butler takes on
language as something that can be productive, that can resignify
meaning, as the option available to those who are trapped within the
signification system.

Butler's exploration of Luce Irigaray's writing style demonstrates how
this process of resignification can take place in language. Irigaray
establishes how significatory systems exclude that which they claim to
signify. She takes Jacques Derrida's concept of phallogocentrism, or
that man, symbolized by the phallus, is the center and focus of
knowledge, as a lens for reading Plato and Aristotle's discussion of
form/matter or bodies/souls binaries. Irigaray demonstrates how these
binaries, which take the category of "woman," associated with "matter"
(materiality, the mother) and set it subordinate to male "form"
(mastering rationality) actually erase the possibility of representing
woman at all. In fact, the binary that claims to represent the
feminine as the subordinated term in masculine/feminine binaries,
actually "produces the feminine as that which must be excluded for
that economy to operate" (10). Because "binary oppositions are
formulated through the exclusion of a field of disruptive
possibilities"(10), the feminine is "domesticated" (13). Butler
explains that the nonfigured feminine remains excessive, outside the
terms of the binary:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
One cannot interpret the philosophical relation to the feminine
through the figures that philosophy provides, but, rather, [Irigaray]
argues, through siting the feminine as the unspeakable condition of
figuration, as that which, in fact, can never be figured within the
terms of philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is
its enabling condition. 12
#+END_QUOTE
What Butler calls the /excessive/ feminine is excluded, or cast out,
as "the necessary outside," which allows the /specular/ feminine to
take its place in the binary. According to Butler, we cannot know what
the feminine consists of without subscribing it to
phallogocentrism. If the feminine is outside the system, and cannot be
figured, how can it be known? Butler aptly questions, "For how can one
read a text for what does /not/ appear within its own terms, but which
nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own
legibility?" (11). For Butler, this is the key question--how do we
work with what we are given to express what is not there, what is
refused by the system of the visible?

Butler offers the solution of "performative citation"--the repetition
and reworking of resignification. Butler explains that Irigaray
achieves this resignification by miming language: "she mimes
philosophy... and, in the mime, takes on a language that effectively
cannot belong to her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use citation as a
strategy of repeating what Plato says with the goal of undermining his
authority: "She cites Plato again and again, but the citations expose
precisely what is excluded from them, and seek to show and to
reintroduce the excluded into the system itself" (18). Through
repetition, Irigaray displaces the logic of phallogocentrism,
introducing something external to the system while remaining within
its terminology. Butler affirms that "Her miming has the effect of
repeating the origin only to displace that origin as an origin"
(18). Her repetition is a way of infiltrating the logic of
phallogocentrism on its own terms. Butler speculates what might have
been Irigaray's internal monologue:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
#+END_QUOTE
Deception through resemblance; insubordination through subservience;
displacement through repetition--these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism.

*** Woolf's /Orlando/
I now turn to looking at gender in Virginia Woolf's novel, /Orlando: A
Biography/. In what follows, I will demonstrate how the phenomenon of
gender guides and influences subjectivity in this text. In this text,
gender is linked to the role of language in the way that they both
activate significatory power. My reading explores how the beginning of
the novel displays the common struggle between gender and language for
for expression. As Orlando settles into her new gender, she finds new
significatory power in language. At the same time, the biographer is
freed to explore more experimental forms for telling Orlando's story.
The difficulty with language that Orlando and the biographer both
experience becomes less and less of an issue as Orlando comes into her
femininity, which is to say, becomes comfortable in herself.

/Orlando/ is a fictional biography that follows the life of the
eponymous 16th-century English nobleman as he undergoes a sex change
and lives into the 20th century as a woman. At the beginning of the
story, Orlando falls in love with a young Russian princess named
Sasha. The scene of this romance is the first of many moments in the
novel where the "problem" of gender is coordinated to the "problem" of
language. For Orlando, the problem is one of signification--he cannot
resolve how to express either one. When he first sees Sasha skating
over the frozen river Thames, he struggles to ascertain whether she is
a man or a woman. Her skilled atheleticism and exotic manner of dress
prevent him from resolving her gender. He proceeds to describe her
using seemingly arbitrary metaphors--another attempt at signification
that also fails:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
He beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him
with the highest curiosity. The person, whatever the name or sex, was
about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed entirely in
oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar greenish-coloured
fur. But these details were obscured by the extraordinary
seductiveness which issued from the whole person. Images, metaphors of
the most extreme and extravagant twined and twisted in his mind. He
called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an emerald, and a fox
in the snow all in the space of three seconds; he did not know whether
he had heard her, tasted her, seen her, or all three together. (For
though we must pause not a moment in the narrative we may here hastily
note that all his images at this time were simple in the extreme to
match his senses and were mostly taken from things he had liked the
taste of as a boy. But if his senses were simple they were at the same
time extremely strong. To pause therefore and seek the reasons of
things is out of the question.)... A melon, an emerald, a fox in the
snow--so he raved, so he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must
be--no woman could skate with such speed and vigour--swept almost on
tiptoe past him, Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that
the person was of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the
question. 
#+END_QUOTE
This passage expresses a mounting sense of tension as Orlando grows
more and more frustrated with Sasha's gender ambiguity. Interestingly,
his growing frustration seems to feed his attraction, as with each
doubting moment Orlando appears more and more desperate, "ready to
tear his hair with vexation." The biographer's role in the narration
of this scene also has its influence on the unfolding tension: the
syntax alternates long and short sentences to express a cyclical
quality about Orlando's confused mental state. The effect of the
narrative style in this section is to mirror with language the
tortuous thought process that Orlando undergoes as he guesses then
doubts the reality of Sasha's gender. Additionally, there is a "pause"
in the action, where the biographer adds another layer of speculation
to Orlando's already conflicted inner thoughts, while simultaneously
drawing attention to the status of the narrative as secondhand
relation--as something that can be arrested or resumed.

While the tension thus mounts throughout the passage, the relationship
between gender and language come to the fore. The biographer's aside
situates Orlando's difficulty of expressing gender within a difficulty
with language--"He called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an
emerald." At the same time that Orlando cannot place Sasha's gender,
he also cannot find the right words to describe her. As Sasha's
probable gender oscillates between male and female throughout passage
and Orlando's desire crescendos, gender takes on imaginative
connotations that propel it beyond the real of human biology,
nevermind biological sex. As the passage continues, the suspense comes
to a climax:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a
boy's, but no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those
breasts; no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from
the bottom of the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping a
curtsey with the utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past on
the arm of some Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a
standstill. She was not a handsbreadth off. She was a woman. 27-28
#+END_QUOTE
The sentences here ebb and flow, reinforcing Orlando's ambivalence
about Sasha's gender ambiguity as he finally settles on Sasha's
gender: "she was a woman." This passage situates gender as something
difficult to grasp, like language.An an early stange of the story,
this scene establishes that if gender is ambiguous, then language is
also imprecise.


As Orlando's relationship with Sasha ends with deceit and desertion,
he succumbs to a long depression that brings him to doubt what he had
previously valued: "Thus, at the age of thirty, or thereabouts, this
young Nobleman had not only had every experience that life has to
offer, but had seen the worthlessness of them all. Love and ambition,
women and poets were all equally vain. Literature was a farce"
(71). At this time, Orlando begins to distrust language's ability to
convey truth. For exampl, in one scene, he struggles with the
representative function of language. Here, Orlando is attempting to
compose a verse, and he cannot decide whether objective or "plain"
language or poetic language is more truthful to his subjects, the
color of the grass and of the sky:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
'The sky is blue,' he said, 'the grass is green.' Looking up, he saw
that, on the contrary, the sky is like the veils which a thousand
Madonnas have let fall from their hair; and the grass fleets and
darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs
from enchanted woods. 'Upon my word,' he said (for he had fallen into
the bad habit of speaking aloud), 'I don't see that one's more true
than another. Both are utterly false.' And he despaired of being able
to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into
a deep dejection. 75
#+END_QUOTE
Orlando cannot comprehend whether plain english, where one can simply
say that "the sky is blue; the grass is green," is preferable to a
more figurative language that makes use of similitude and
allusion--"the sky is like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have
let fall from their hair; the grass fleets and darkens like a flight
of girls... ." For Orlando, both plain and figurative language are
deficient.

At the same time that Orlando has his doubts about language, so the
biographer grapples with his role as a narrator of the story. At the
start of the story, the biographer distinguishes his role from that of
the poet, who uses figurative language to describe their subject. An
early passage begins with the narrator noting Orlando's exquisite
beauty: "A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to
find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still the biographer who
records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he
invoke the help of novelist or poet" (12). The biographer then asserts
that is aim is to record Orlando as a scribe, "following after" him,
"from deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office"
(12). Honoring his committment for straightforward narration, the
description of Orlando's face begins soberly enough with simple
sentence structure that describe Orlando's features with some
insertion of modest figurative comparisons, such as the "peach down"
of the lips, teeth of "an exquisite and almond whiteness," the "tense
flight" of the "arrowy nose," etc. However, as the passage progresses,
the narrator falls back to figuration:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit
that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed
to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling
of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were
his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we
rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit
a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer
to ignore. 12-13
#+END_QUOTE
When the biographer's descriptive catalogue reaches Orlando's eyes and
forehead, his style ascends into full-fledged figuration, admitting
Orlando has eyes "like drench'd violets." The issue is that Orlando is
too beautiful for literal description, requiring the biographer to draw on the
strategies of the poet, using imagery and simile. Further in the
story, in the chapter of Orlando's sex change, the biographer again
falls back onto poetic strategies to tell Orlando's story.

In the middle of the story, Orlando undergoes a sex change. In the
narration of the event, the biographer demonstrates how literal or
plain language is always a step behind the reality that it attempts to
portray by asserting a shift in gender pronouns:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We may take advantage of this pause in the narrative to make certain
statements. Orlando had become a woman--there is no denying it. But in
every other respect, Orlando remained precisely as he had been. The
change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to
alter their identity. Their faces remained, as their portraits prove,
practically the same. His memory--but in future, we must for
convention's sake, say 'her' for 'his;' and 'she' for 'he'--her memory
then, went back through all the events of her past life without
encountering any obstacle. 102-103
#+END_QUOTE
Here, the narrator cycles through the pronouns "he," "they," "she,"
one after the other, in a way that shows how language lags behind
gender. First, the biographer uses the male "he," then gender neutral
"they," before finally settling on the female "she." The progression
of pronouns in this section are literally catching up to the reality
of Orlando's new gender. This is an example of how literal language
struggles to represent gender, how it lags slightly behind the
expression of gender.

After the sex change, when Orlando meets and marries a gender
ambiguous man named Shel, her issues with language begin to
resolve. She has an experience where language suddenly takes on
significatory power. In a scene that revises the prior one of the
young, heartbroken Orlando attempting to describe the color of the sky
and the grass, Orlando is now in Hyde Park, watching a toy boat
negotiate a wavelet on the Serpentine river. Momentarily, the boat
disappears then re-emerges on the other side of the wavelet. Suddenly
realizing that language can take on extraordinary significatory power,
Orlando associates this moment with the word "ecstasy." She hurries to
telegram the phrase, 'a toy boat on the serpentine' and 'ecstasy,' to
Shel, who she knows will immediately understand what it means. As she
runs to the post office, she meditates on the nature of language and
literature, which she now realizes is violently ecstatic.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,' she repeated, thus enforcing upon
herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor
eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter; it's
something useless, sudden, violent; something that costs a life; red,
blue, purple; a spirit; a splash; like those hyacinths (she was passing a
fine bed of them); free from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or
care for one's kind; something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth,
husband I mean, Bonthrop: that's what it is--a toy boat on the
Serpentine, ecstasy--it's ecstasy that matters. 
#+END_QUOTE
In direct contrast to the earlier scene, where Orlando "despaired of
being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is
and fell into a deep dejection" (75), language now has the power to
signify. This concentration of meaning, in which "a toy boat" and
"ecstasy" are reduced to a common denominator of an ecstatic feeling,
elevates the potential for language to express reality. The symmetry
of these two episodes, which occur on opposite ends of the story, show
how Orlando moves beyond a disappointment in the limitations of
language for expression to a new faith in its power to mean.

As Orlando resolves her struggle with language, so does the
biographer. The biographer increasingly drops his pretension toward
accuracy and boldly speculates, without excuses, elements of the
narrative. For example, when Orlando first meets her lover Shel, the
biographer draws the reader into imagining how this courtship
proceeded:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Shel, my darling,' she began again, 'tell me...' and so they talked
two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and really it
would profit little to write down what they said, for they knew each
other so well that they could say anything, which is tantamount to
saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things as how to cook an
omelette, or where to buy the best boots in London, things which have
no lustre taken from their setting, yet are positively of amazing
beauty within it. For it has come about, by the wise economy of
nature, that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language; the
commonest expressions do, since no expressions do; hence the most
ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and the most poetic is
precisely that which cannot be written down. For which reasons we
leave a great blank here, which must be taken to indicate that the
space is filled to repletion.
#+END_QUOTE
The biographer here explains that although the conversation was
actually beautiful and poetic when it took place, it would come across
as ordinary to the reader. The reader then encounters a space break
which the biographer instructs her to imagine is "filled to
repletion." Because the means to express this conversation do not
exist in language, the biographer invites the reader to fill in the
space, to use speculation and guesses as to what happened. 

Comparing the biographer and Orlando's experiences with language
surface an interesting insight: language and gender are connected
because they both contain significatory power. While earlier in the
novel, Orlando cannot express the meaning of "blue" and "green," she
eventually resolves the significatory power in the phrase "toy boat."
At the same time, at the level of the narration, the biographer
introduces narrative strategies like the space break, which breaks
open language's ability to mean. Language and gender are thus
connected in creating significatory power, constructing meaning in
their imaginative potential . 

Next, I use text analysis to further explore the relationship between
language and gender. So the question then becomes: how are language
and gender co-constructed in Orlando? And what is the role of
signification in resolving these issues?

** TODO Queer Distant Reading
A method of distant reading attends to gender as an iterative
practice. We find ever expanding ways that gender is characterized in
/Orlando/.

*** reproducibility vs iteration
This notion of iteration--which cuts across both text analysis methods
with NLTK and Butler's theory of gender performativity--is the key for
understanding how a repetitive action can lead to new output. In my
previous discussion of reproducibility, I explain how Underwood's
analysis on gender differences reproduces his assumptions about gender
dynamics as oppositional, as he readily admits: "this chapter has
discovered stable 'structural positions' only because it explores
gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant Horizons/
140). The the binary structure, which is inherent to linear regression
models, reproduces itself the initial assumptions in the
result. Because reproducibility aims for what Underwood describes as a
"simple picture," it collapses or flattens the complexity of data, in
this case, gender, into workable units ("Machine Learning" 98). By
shifting the understanding of reproducibility to iteration, we open up
the possibility for using these tools to interpret elements of gender
and sexuality in text.

*** bode and butler parallel on productivity in iteration
Iteration departs from reproducibility because iteration
self-consciously harnesses the productive qualities of
reproducibility. We begin to see this in the way that Bode describes
her critical approach, "agential realism," which mirrors Butler's
explanation of gender performativity. Bode describes two approaches
for literary criticism, the "representationalist" approach (in which
data represents or expresses real objects and subjects in the world)
and the another approach understands data "as part of the ongoing
materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events always arising
from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured" (Bode
"Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to Performative
Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a representationalist
approach toward language and materiality, in which language can
/refer/ to materiality as something that is prior, against the
performative approach, by which language works through repetition to
signify and resignify meaning:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
#+END_QUOTE
The alignment here between Bode and Butler indicates an intersection
between the digital and gender as processes, which center on the role
of iteration in conveying meaning. There is something fundamentally
productive about these phenomena, and not in the way that they purport
to represent some real quality or object in the world. Rather, the
productive aspect has to do with how they iterate their material over
and again in ways that are fundamentally creative.

*** similar_words("woman" & "man")

In what follows, I will use the python text analysis library NLTK to
analyze gender in Woolf's novel, /Orlando/. Specifically, I will
explore the words associated with "woman" and "man" across this text,
toward the goal of making a kind of "model" for gender performativity
in /Orlando/. Thinking back to my close reading of /Orlando/, I found
that the way that gender works is closely tied to the way that
language works--Orlando and the biographer conflate the difficulty of
expressing gender to that of telling a story, or writing a poem,
thoughout the text. There is something about gender and language which
is highly constrained, as both Orlando and the narrator are oppressed
by them, but also highly imaginative, eventually allowing both
subjects the potential for signification. Therefore, I will begin my
text analysis by exploring how the terms "woman" and "man" are
characterize in the novel. The computational process that I use will
draw from Butler's theory of performativity by "resignifying" the
terms "woman" and "man" in repeated computations. The final output
will present a series of terms associated with man and woman after
various reiterative computations of the terms throughout the text.

We begin by running the ~similar_words()~ method from the
nltk.text.ContextIndex class, which functions very nearly like the
~Text.similar()~ method described previously. This ~similar_words()~
method takes a word, such as "woman," and returns the top words that
appear most similarly to that word in the text. Below is the
definition of the ContextIndex class from the NLTK source code:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
class ContextIndex(object):
    """
    A bidirectional index between words and their 'contexts' in a text.
    The context of a word is usually defined to be the words that occur
    in a fixed window around the word; but other definitions may also
    be used by providing a custom context function.
    """
#+END_SOURCE

The NLTK documentation explains that similarity is computed by
processing the words that directly surround the given word, or its
"context," and finding other words that have similar contexts. In the
source code for the ~similar_words()~ method, there is an ~if loop~
that instructs the program to search if the words in the context also
are associated with other words throughout the text. It then returns a
list of the 20 most frequent terms which have similar contexts to the
given word.[fn:14]

Below is the output for the words, "woman" and "man," respectively:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
> similar_words("woman")
'reached till friend word moment saw always could cried sailor wit
scarcely petticoat go servant conclusion'

> similar_words("man") 
'hurry father window tongue carriage still even countrywoman indulged
old fortune title ship writing fell become always love grown never'
#+END_QUOTE
	  
*** iterating over code resignifies it
Each time a text is processed in computation, it is submitted to a
governing code. In this case of the ~similar_words()~ method, the code
reduces the text to whatever conditions are contained within the
function loop. The output therefore is directly constrained to the
conditions in the input. Each time one feeds the output of our
computation to a new one, running ~similar_words()~ method again, they
gain an even more refined list of words that are associated with
"woman" and "man."  Below are the results of running ~similar_words()~
taking the output of the previous run of ~similar_words("woman")~ as
the new input:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
'come friend scarcely make happiness could say wisdom used thing grown
love shape dog wit saw always explain understood ran time prophet
indeed word stood met laughing sailor none able mixture allied woman
fly way year bird might known man toss sake thought reached cried
leave till account first petticoat fool would roused encumbrance
become window rust another madam london'
#+END_SOURCE

And the output for ~similar_words("man")~, running it a second time:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE 
'title come need fault carriage tongue fortune death hungry passion
gloomy grown love written still must always saw exactly alone almost
perhaps take word matter determined orlando beautiful hear hurry woman
boy plump sens man soon little morning full strength whose two father
monstrously without ever would roused kinsman admit become old window
sink moment'
#+END_SOURCE

One may continue to run this ~similar_words()~ analysis, feeding the
output as new input, to get an ever expanding sense of words which are
associated with gender. This would be interesting, as the repertoire
for "woman" and "man" would swell to significations that elude the
gender as a binary. Eventually, however, the repertoire would include
more and more shared terms between the two genders. To avoid what
would inevitably be a merging of words associated with each gender, we
can slightly change the input before running the computation again. We
will filter out any words that were shared between the categories of
"woman" and "man". This will allow us to get a better sense of gender
/distinction/ in the text.

Filtering out shared words, and placed unique, similar words for "man"
and for "woman" into a new list, we can run ~similar_words()~
again. For ~similar_words()~ on the words associated with "woman," we
get the following /unique/ words:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
'among slipping launched child beneath shape new gently prophet indeed
true knee denied fasten bird hot found finger person bred leave nail
reflection character hid used month profit green since ran spoke omit
standing prayer bald frequent good heard scramble try bethink burst
ring street none may happiness wisdom let draw sawings top summer day
upstairs went ribbon known catching case thought ask flung fool voyage
observed minute able people come ala raising gave laughing looked
third side allied fly might slept suddenly thousand going blackness
groping rust sag london'
#+END_SOURCE

For "man," we get:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
'certain need fault wicket agitate hungry long passion talk circle
ague whatever written turn said explain treachery husband beast
remembered sleep longer pared filled tell princess deep beard tied
beautiful hear put mixture profound fumbled inborn rout immovable
plump awkwardness sens sofa whole mind morning imagine toss many made
iron blush round set whose raised first part monstrously without
needing taste story boyish admitted longed insisted looking glance
pushing'
#+END_SOURCE

By filtering out shared words between "woman" and "man," we come
closer to modelling gender distinctiveness in this text. To be clear,
gender in this sense descends from a binary system--from the initial
analysis of "woman" and "man." However, from this initial
binarization, it leads to a plurality of significations.  

This kind of iterative analysis, where the data is being adjusted to
increase the distinctiveness and complexity of the output, works
toward /resignifying/ the initial understanding of "woman" and "man."
It takes what Butler says about gender being an iterative performance,
which is continually "citing" the regulatory norm, and submits this
performance to the highly iterative process of running text through
computational analysis. 

Like gender subversion, this kind of computational analysis works
through strict protocols of repetition and iteration toward some kind
of disruptive end goal. As Alexander Galloway affirms, “Protocol is
synonymous with possibility” (167). Galloway here is discussing
network theory, and by "protocol," he refers specifically to the codes
that append data which mades connections possible in a network. Like
gender performativity, networks are constrained by protocols, which
enable and structure connections between nodes. Despite the
restrictions of protocol, however, there is a freedom in the
possibility of connection, where each node is free to connect to
another within the system.[fn:15] Similarly to hackers in a network,
Butler's idea of gender subversion is is looking for the "exploit,"
the way to disrupt the system by using the system’s own rules. The key
to Butler's exploit is the iterative nature of gender performativity,
which can be used to repeat and resignify meaning.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
The compulsion to repeat an injury is not necessarily the compulsion
to repeat the injury in the same way or to stay fully within the
traumatic orbit of that injury. The force of repetition in language
may be the paradoxical condition by which a certain agency---not
linked to a fiction of the ego as master of circumstance---is derived
from the impossibility of choice. 83 
#+END_QUOTE
Butler explains that the repetition of language is what enables
a certain agency to emerge in repetition. Repetition is the means by
which dominant or established meaning can be resignified. 

*** TODO Findings: new configurations of gender
https://github.com/rafadavis/intro_net_analysis/blob/master/1_intro.md

[Visualization of gender distinctiveness in /Orlando/ using the python
networkx module]

This [forthcoming!] model of gender distinctiveness in /Orlando/ draws
from the same principles as Pamela Caughie et al. in their work in
visualizing gender ontology in /Man Into Woman/ (1931), the life
narrative of Lili Elbe, one of the first persons to undergo gender
affirmation surgery. As Caughie and her team struggle to mark gender
shifts throughout the text in a way that accords with the constraints
of the archival methodology, they wonder whether computational models
can capture such taxonomic chaos of gender ontology. However, they
ultimately find that the issue with categorizing gender doesn't need a
solution. Rather, it needs a way of showing gender dynamicity while
still being readable. The scholars point out that the issue with
ontology /should/ remain unresolved: "Confusion in gender and sexual
terminologies... is part of the experienceof gender and sexuality in
the modernist era, something to be realized and negotiated in readings
of the narrative" (239). Thus they ended up creating a "storm cloud"
of gender, showing clusters of different gender traits in the text
over time.

*** TODO the constraint: the power of the imagination

In my previous close reading of /Orlando/, I found that gender is
linked to the role of language in the way that they both are highly
constructed phenomena that activate significatory power. After
exploring the ways that gender and language are coordinately
constructed in the novel, I was left with a question about the role of
the imagination in influencing gender and language. This text analysis
of Orlando attempts to bear out the implications of this question, to
explore how the imaginative use of language, represented in the ever
expanding networks of gender signification, troubles the idea of
gender as a binary system. The process of running the gender terms
"woman" and "man" reveals how even a constrained process of repeated
computations can help to complicate or diversify the data, rather than
simplify or reduce it. This notion of displacement through repetition
is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the iterative
process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures that
re-signify certain elements of that text.

[incorporate scholarship of Orlando to this end - about pluralistic
genders and sexualities: Jessica Berman, Christy L. Burns, Jane de
Gay, VL Smith...].

*** preserving the unintelligible

Although I aim to offer a model of gender in the novel, as Butler
affirms, "radical and inclusive representability is not precisely the
goal" (/Bodies/ 25). Remaining /outside/ what Butler calls the "logic
of phallogocentrism" is necessary to prevent being coopted into that
logic. The process of performative citation is meant to preserve that
which is excluded or unintelligible as a resource for continual
resignification, as "the point of departure for a set of historical
reflections and futural imaginings" (Butler /Bodies/ 173). For, Butler
explains that, "to bring in every marginal and excluded position
within a given discourse is to claim that a singular discourse meets
its limits nowhere, that it can and will domesticate all signs of
difference" (25). Rather than aim for inclusion, one ought to position
the "necessary outside" as a target that is beyond reach, as a fount
for future subversions. This positioning allows individuals to harness
opacity and unintelligibility as a resource for resisting the
"violence of this exclusion," using unrepresentability as a tool for
disruption. 

*** Conclusion: performative citation queers distant reading: 

Displacement through repetition; insubordination through subservience;
deception through resemblance--these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism. I began
this analysis into /Orlando/ by close reading sections of the text, to
explore how gender functions as an enabling structure. This reading
found that gender is closely coordinated with language, as Orlando and
the biographer, across different narrative levels of the story,
struggle with both simultaneously. I read for gender as an enabling
structure, and then used text analysis to play with gender by
repeating the same processes of computing "gendered" term similarities
over and over again. I saw how gender in this novel resembles an
expanding web of terms that multiply while remaining distinct, which
complicates the notion of gender as a binary system even within that
system. This method of iterating over text allowed me to illuminate
the structure of the signifying power without giving that power the
ability to counter that which is questioning its authority. Although
one may attempt to formalize such a method, my goal is not to build
reproducible schemas and models for analyzing gender in
novels. Rather, I look to harness opacity and unintelligibility as
resources for resisting inclusion. This method posits gender as a kind
of technology of resistance, which the technology of digital tools can
help to surface. I hope this work will encourage the further
development of such approaches, which, as Butler nicely articulates,
"begin, without ending, without mastering, to own – and yet never
fully to own – the exclusions by which we proceed" (25).

*** gio on voyant / nltk
    I'm playing around with voyant tools on Giovanni's Room, and realizing
that my movements are carefully guided by this impression from textual
scholarship of deformance. At every step I am deforming the text,
creating a new text, with new potentials for reading. 

This deformance is an iterative process. 

There's a dip in the word "don't" toward the end of the novel, in
section 9. But when we get get the contexts into its own text
submission, there's a rise in this same sector. What's going on? 

Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter
five, a spike that is surrounded with a dearth of don'ts. This
explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

This activity calls for closer attention to the area of the spike, and
its surroundings.

What if we read only the sentences with the word "don't" in them?

*** Altschuler and Weimar on reproducibility

--> reproducing something perfectly overlooks the ways that all
digital objects are unique, differentiated. Theory of textual
criticism which shows how ther are more interesting things to do then
create a digital "copy texte". 

This notion extends to digital humanist practitioners. 

they call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses" while maintaining that reproduction is
the highest value. They argue to "texture the humanities", pointing
out that much of DH prioritizes the visual over other senses --
"privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible"
(74). Rightly so, they argue, “The textured DH we call for here
acknowledges that we cannot study knowledge only abstractly, apart
from the senses, and that we cannot study literature, art, and history
without including the history of embodied experiences” (74-75).
- “Touch This Page! uses 3-D printed facsimiles of raised-letter text
  to inspire reflection on the assumptions most people make about
  which senses are involved in reading” (82).

But they elide the one interesting trajectory when they place
reproduction over remediation/deformance. They state their aims: “to
expand the sensory accessibility of archives for all users and to do
so through the digital reproduction---rather than the translation---of
tactile knowledge” (76). Case example of the perfect reproduction:
- A scenario where “users... can download a visual copy with
descriptive data, engage with the text in virtual reality, and create
their own textured facsimile. This technology once more makes possible
the tactile reading experiences for which this volume was designed and
promises library patrons a richer engagement with touch than most
archives can currently provide---even in person (85-86). 

The use case scenario makes the assumption that a reproduction is the
ideal form of textuality, despite their asserted aims for "diversity
of embodied experiences":
- “we must avoid tilting after the fiction of some ideal digital
  surrogate---like a virtual reality system that would flawlessly
  mimic original objects---lest we become digital Pierre Menards,
  expending extensive energy to improve our reproductions to discover,
  at last, that only the original perfects represents itself… Instead,
  we envision in our tactile futures multiple strategies that could
  not only open up access to varied experiences---past and
  present---but also diversity the ways embodied experiences structure
  our digital worlds” (86).
- in order to open up “multiple strategies” and diversity embodied
  experiences, we need a theory of text that is capacious enough to
  accept variation and transmediation.
- This argument overlooks deformance is a solution: the ways that
  creating new texts, paratexts, creates new objects of knowledge. It
  overlooks the performative, ala McGann, Clement.

In this view, digital becomes a means of optimization, efficiency,
total knowledge and understanding.

*** The debates about TEI illustrates this tension between the
“conservative” and the “creative” impulses in textual editing, and
shows how an encoding method that is highly structured can be used to
mark or explore moments of textual instability or ambiguity.

*** felski on affects beside suspicion



Postcritical Reading…  “in this sense, is not just a cognitive
activity but an embodied mode of attentiveness that involves us in
acts of sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering, and engaging”
(Felski 176). 

Felski: At stake is our receptivity: “to allow ourselves to be marked,
struck, impressed by what we read” (Felski 12). 

"the reader-text connection becomes part of a network rather than a
self-enclosed dyad— yet a connection that remains vital to literary
studies, especially in the classroom. Reading, in this light, is a
matter of attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging
links between things that were previously unconnected. It is not a
question of plumbing depths or tracing surfaces… Interpretation
becomes a coproduction between actors that brings new things to light
rather than an endless rumination on a text’s hidden meanings or
representational failures” (Felski 174)

Surface reading challenges that search for absence by compelling a
reader to stay with what the text says and how it says it rather than
moving ahead to probe how it reflects and refracts larger cultural
patterns. This critique reifies aesthetic objects and suggests that
literary critics should embrace the literary.

*** mcpherson, benjamin on race and tech
Major developments in technology also perpetuate racial
assumptions. Moving from networking technologies to software
development, Tara McPherson explores the parallels between the
Operating Systems and race relations, to show how the development of
computer software betrays hegemonic assumptions about whiteness and
elisions of difference.[fn:16] She focuses on the key moment of 1960s
United States, when Operating Systems, which is the foundational
software that supports a computer's programs and basic functioning,
developed alongside civil rights discourses. Her research focuses on
how "the organization of information and capital" in OS development
resonates in the struggles for racial justice: "Many of these shifts
were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
radicalism" (30). McPherson deconstructs the UNIX operating system
which includes a hierarchical file system, a command line interpreter
(the Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), and a variety of
software programs that are designed to work in tandem. McPherson
points out that UNIX-based Operating Systems (like Mac and Linux) are
distinguished by the ways that they partition and simplify complex
processes into discrete components, similar to the ways that identity
politics cordones off parts of the (social and technological) system
into distinct units. While this cordoning was productive for the
promotion of civil rights, it also, according to McPherson, "curtailed
and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing
struggle to fairly discrete parameters" (30).

Crystallizing the intersection between Operating Systems and race
relations, McPherson asserts that "Certain modes of racial visibility
and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing
data" (24). McPherson emphasizes the "rules" of UNIX philosophy, which
lay out how UNIX's development prioritized the organization and
simplification of data processing:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear
by demonstration that nothing else will do. Rule of Transparency:
Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier... Rule
of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be
stupid and robust. 26
#+END_QUOTE
The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions. The rule of "Transparency" flattens
nuance and ambiguity, making program components as legible as
possible. The rule of "Representation," particularly the suggestion to
"Fold knowledge into data" reduces the complexity of raw data, so that
it can be easily input into multiple processes. According to
McPherson, all of these rules work together to shore up the central
design theory of "modularity,"[fn:17] which stipulates that components
are self-contained and interoperable, so they can be independently
created, modified, and replaced without affecting the whole system.

The role of control in creating the internet and the emphasis on data
reduction in developing operating stystems leave their legacies on
21st century digital technology, where race becomes collapsed into
data. Echoing McPherson, Ruha Benjamin asserts that technology
reproduces social inequities under the guise of objectivity and
progressivism.[fn:18] Turning to technology, Benjamin explores how
innovations in Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic computing
extend racist paradigms into ever new tools, particularly in data
gathering and surveillance. The creators of these new technologies
mark, track, and quantify blackness, for example, in databases for
healthcare or financial services that associate "black names" with
criminality (Benjamin 5). With each update, technology is continually
promoted as efficient and progressive in a way that masks how it
exploits data about its subjects. Benjamin explains, "we are told that
how tech sees “difference” is a more objective reflection of reality
than if a mere human produced the same results... bias enters through
the backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6). As she points out, "the road
to inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7). Like the creators of
UNIX, the creators of such tools and algorithms operate under
assumptions of white universality that inevitably marks blackness as
"other."

*** sedgwick on liberatory vs prohibition
Sedgwick searches for "some ways of understanding human desire that might
be quite to the side of prohibition and repression, that might hence
be structured quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory,'
inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting down and attacking
prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic guises" (10).

*** Tenen, Dennis. Plain Text: the Poetics of Computation, 2017. Epub.

Tenen proposes a microanalysis, computational poetics, or an
archaeology of platforms and infrastructures (behind surface
content). We don’t engage directly with the textual conduit, so we
need to perform a media archaeology in order to have access to these
processes and be in charge of them.

Decentralization. 2004.

Horizontal freedom requires universalization,
standardization. Resistance comes from within the system, using
exploits.

The potential for individual empowerment comes from harnessing our own
vulnerabilities and exposure. Without exposure, give and take, there
is no network.

Approaches the network as a vital non-anthropocentric ecology,
connecting humans to inert matter, endowing them with agency.

Black Study. 2013.

A way of being in but not of the university, system,

to one another that resists the system.

*** Tufekci, Zeynep. Twitter and Tear Gas: the Power and Fragility of
Networked Protest. 2017.

How humans aided with technology create networks, and how these
operate on the ground. What capacities do they have, how does their
horizontalism both help and hurt?

*** Gaboury, Jacob. "Becoming NULL: Queer Relations in the Excluded
Middle." Women & Performance: a Journal of Feminist
Theory. 28:2, 2018. pp. 143-158. Web.

What are queer modes of being within technological systems, modes that
refuse the gesture of capture and extraction? The NULL marker in SQL
offers a way of becoming that enacts a queer logic that is explicitly
situated within the logic of information systems but refuses this
gesture of capture and extraction.

*** Kittler, Friedrich. Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. 1999.

At first, media passes through symbols (written signifier), then
analog media is stored as physical traces, and now, new media loses
its specificity as a stream of numbers (“eyewash”), surface effects
which are then reassembled in the human. The human perceptual system
disperses into the apparatus.
 
What sense perceptions are we not aware of or not tapping? This opens
up the potentials of bits and fiber.
 
*** Hayles, N. Katherine. Writing Machines. 2002.
Media is re-conceived, written, mediated for different formats---the
concept of remediation.
 
Reading technotexts takes place within a distributed cognitive
environment. We are part of a larger cybernetic circuit.
 
*** Kirschenbaum, Matthew. Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic
Imagination. 2008.

Digital media create an illusion of immateriality---screen
essentialism. We should approach materiality on two levels, the formal
and forensic, to counter misunderstandings and occlusions of new
media. Electronic texts are not ephemeral or homogenous, they are
inscribed and made of unique traces.

*** Hansen, Mark. Feed-Forward: On The Future of 21st Century Media. 2014.

The way that media works in the 21st century both marginalizes and
expands human perception. Things we have no awareness of are out there
feeling for us. We have an expanded perceptual reach, but our
sensations are indirect. This puts consciousness in an anticipatory
mode, always future oriented, focusing on what is nearly emergent---
“feed forward”.

Presents a “versioning edition” of the various print witnesses of
Woolf’s short story, the Mark on the Wall, from 1917-1944.  The
versioning edition’s attention to the story over time also implicitly
draws attention to the way that time functions on the level of
narrative.

*** Peters, John Durham. The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of
Elemental Media. 2016.

*** McKenzie, D.F. Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts. 1986.

Individual texts are witnesses of an ideal text that is never to be
fully realized---the florid branches of an invisible trunk.
Bibliography is about tracking the book’s history as a social
document, the social relations involved in its transmission, and about
recognizing different critic’s “misreadings”. Book history is a
history of misreadings.

*** Tanselle, Thomas. "A Rationale of Textual Criticism." 1992.

Texts are corrupted in physical form and require assistance of an
editor to present in an authentic state. The imperative of textual
criticism is to restore and correct.

*** Derrida, Jacques. “Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression.”
Diacritics. Vol. 25, no. 2. 1995.

The archive works against itself: creating an archive also creates the
potential to forget and destroy. Externalization.  The instant of
archivization involves technology: ‘the prosthetic experience of the
technical substrate’ (22).

*** McGann, Jerome. Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide
Web. 2001.

Electronic editing ought to capture what is inherently n-dimensional
about literary texts---to engage in the quantum poetics of each
textual detail.

*** Singer, Kate. “Digital Close Reading: TEI for Teaching Poetic
Vocabularies.” The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. 3,
May 15, 2013.

Using TEI to teach close reading finds that one can approach it to
engage individualized readings---marking moments of textual
instability rather than formal aspects. Given that the tool is
flexible enough, we do not have to agree on a schema, standardize a
schema, in order to use the tool to engage the incommensurable.


*** Caughie, Emily Datskou and Rebecca Parker. “Storm Clouds on the
Horizon: Feminist Ontologies and the Problem of Gender.” Feminist
Modernist Studies. 1:3, 230-242. 2018.

What do we do when our tools won’t allow us to capture or convey
certain elements of the text? It turns out that the limitations of the
computer are actually a good indicator of things that maybe should be
left unresolved or unfixed---like gender ontology.

[fn:24] Such methods are often used in assessing authorship and
authenticity, and stylometry in particular predates computing and has
notable cases in English Renaissance drama and biblical
texts. Generally, stylometry evaluates writing style by extracting and
analysing distinctive features in text. Often used in stylometry,
word-frequency analysis examines word usage to determine authorship of
a text.

[fn:23] Stephen Ramsay, in /Reading Machines/ makes this point in his
critique of Moretti. Accrding to Ramsay, Moretti’s claims that his
insights are “independent of interpretation” and his goal of
“falsification” suggest that “data is presented to us…  not as
something that is also in need of interpretation” (/Reading Machines/

[fn:4] Andrew Piper's methodology, which he calls "bifocal" reading,
demonstrates how distant and close reading are used together, with
distant reading providing the context or framework that guides close
reading"“We are no longer using our own judgments as benchmarks... but
explicitly constructing the context through which something is seen as
significant (and the means through which significance is
assessed).... It interweaves subjectivity with objects” (Piper,

[fn:10] He measures the "gendering of words used in characterization"
("Machine Learning and Human Perspective" 95), that is, gender
portrayed in novels by women and in novels by men. The verticle axis
visualizes the representation of words by women, and the horizontal by
men, with positive numbers signifying overrepresentation of these
terms. So terms on the top right are words that are used often by men
and women writers, and terms in the upper left and lower right are
ones used most often by women and men, respectively.
