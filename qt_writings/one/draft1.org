**** chapter summary 
This dissertation looks at new ways of reading /queer bodies/ and
/queer experience/ within technological contexts. How do digital tools
and platforms change the way we interact with affect (associated with
queer experience and embodiment) within texts? What about the digital
allows us to activate /sensational/ reading experiences? In other
words, how does digital media interface with queerness?

This chapter proposes a reading methodology that leverages the
critic's relationship to the text to open possibilities for
interpretation and connections to the textual material. It explores
the ways that reading practices across two different fields (digital
humanities and queer theory) intertwine, and how this creates a new
method for reading queer narratives in digital contexts.

First, queerness is established as something that can only be touched
"at a distance." It is defined as a /desire for touch/ (digital
touch), a desire /that cannot be satisfied, redeemed, or
recovered/. This impulse to satisfy, redeem, or recover queerness is
observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading practices, which seek
to answer or discover the “hidden” meaning within text. These
practices attempt to answer questions, but do so in a way that
constrains inquiry, because paranoia only delivers the results that
are /imaginable/ within current the knowledge structures. To avoid
reproducing these knowledge structures, we must look to strategies
that do not assume full connections, like /feeling backward/ and
/queer form/. We value abstraction, which is necessary for bringing
things into relation, and opacity, which keeps the unknowable nature
of queer experience and identity somewhat in tact. We look at
/Confessions of the Fox/, /These Waves of Girls/, /Borderlands/.

Second, we examine a similar impulse in DH---and a parallel across the
status of queerness and data, which cannot be captured in their raw
forms. The history of computing and media shows how tools were built
in ways that are not neutral, and we find DH practitioners doing work
that is critical of digital methods. Looking at the example of DH from
the position of queerness we see more clearly the necessity of
opacity, formalization, and abstraction as reading methods, and the
real danger of reproducibility and totalization, byproducts of
paranoia. We find parallels between queer critics and feminist DHers,
who are doing something similar; we interweave Saidiya Hartman and
Lauren Klein.

Third, we propose three values for queer DH, which is: novelty (the
performative), vantages (the visual), and provisionality (the
ontological). We see these examples in /voyant-tools/, /these waves
of girls/, and /the orlando project/(?). 



** intro touch via Rosenberg, Fischer, Anzaldua
*** touch intersects queer and digital, abstracting sense

If digital humanists and queer theorists are going to find some common
ground, they might start with /touch/. Touch is a means of interfacing
with the world, a mode of encounter between subject and object that
applies to both digital media and queer subjects. The root of the word
digital, "digitus," comes from the Latin word for finger or toe, and
within the context of electronic media, it refers to a counting system
based on ten digits[fn:1]. Associations between the digital and touch
expand from numerical computation to include the haptic connections
made through the intermediaries of mice, keyboards, and touch
screens. To touch something, the digits extend, the furtherest
appendage still part of the coherent body, and establish
contact. Touch relates to queerness through the desire for touching
that which is untouchable. It indexes a lack of access to the source
of its desire.

As a method of knowing based on feeling, touch can amplify sensation
beyond the readily sensible. A complicated thesis about touch which
this chapter will unpack: At the intersection of queerness and the
digital, touch operates by abstracting its object through the
intermediary of the sensible. This process of abstraction compensates
for the core condition of queerness, which is untouchable, unknowable,
and inexpressible. By transforming the inaccessible source into new
forms, /queer forms/, queerness is exponentially sensualized and
engaging. Within digital queer literary materials, touch is a /reading
method/ that works by abstracting the senses to provide alternative
possibilities for connection.

*** /Waves/: queerness (story) is frustrating closure, eluding touch
Queerness is concerned with touch and desire, and more precisely with
/the desire for touching/. One example text figures touching as desire
quite literally, with touch being a means of pursuing desire. This
"hypertext," which is an electronic text format that links "nodes" or
pages within an associative structure, enacts desire by tempting the
reader through the various episodes of the story in order to achieve
narrative closure. /These Waves of Girls/, by Caitlin Fisher, is an
autobiographical account of the author's sexual coming-of-age. The
narrative unfolds in a series of vignettes connected to each other by
associative hyperlinks, which recount Fischer's adolescent experiences
with men and women when she was growing up in England. Despite winning
the 2001 Electronic Literature Organization Award, this "hypertext
novella" draws much criticism for a formal structure precludes a
straightforward reading experience. Through the profusion of
hyperlinks, which connect one node to the next in ways that disrupt
temporal and causal relations, this hypertext frustrates the reader’s
desire for narrative coherence. The relatively comfortable and
conventional reading practice of turning the pages in a traditional
codex dissolves in the distracting and technical complexity of a
narrative that requires what Espen Aarseth calls “untrivial effort” to
traverse (1). An empirical study on reader responses to the
fragmentation of narrative structure finds that the “heavy cognitive
demands of the interfaces used by hyper-writers" lead to reader
frustration, dissapointment, and low engagement (Pope “Where do we Go
from Here?”  75). Speaking on /Waves/ in particular, James Pope argues
that the use of hyperlinks “present[s] a baffling range of choices for
movement which actually led to a stifling of movement altogether”
(“Significance”). Joining Pope, Anja Rau criticizes the overabundance
of options for movement within the hypertext, as well as its poor
design and lack of significant markers. She comes to the similar
conclusion that these elements diminish the reader’s absorption in the
narrative.

[![Watch the video](./videos/erotic.mp4)]

"DARE" > [arrow] > [arrow] > "I liked girls..." > "the lover" > "Only one of us is 15..." > "Jerk off…"

I want to draw attention to this disorienting feeling of reading this
text. Episodes do not have a discernible chronology or
progression. They are non-linear, and clicking on the links is
disruptive to any sense of coherence. The expectation for narrative
coherence and closure is continually frustrated by the work’s
form. Yet, in another sense, the fragmentary structure of the
narrative is exactly what constitutes its appeal, as it compels the
reader to chase an elusive understanding of sexuality. In particular,
the text continually defies the reader’s expectations about the
narrator. In the repeatedly linked node, aptly titled “erotic,” we see
“and it was the most erotic year of my life” march across the screen
in ticker tape (“And it was...”). This node is reached through two
different sources, both of which feature sexual episodes between the
narrator and men. **In a novella that largely consists of stories
about the narrator’s sexual histories and fantasies with other women,
this node is unexpected. It checks the reader’s expectations about the
narrator’s homosexuality. There are other moments in the text that
also create a similar dissonance from the associations between
links. One of these associations occurs in the last node of the “beam
routine” episode, when the narrator is about to perform her beam
routine to sexually placate the man that she brought home. The link
reads “I don’t want to have sex,” and it leads the reader to an
episode about her experience with a woman:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I’m in bed with Jennie Winchester and I realize she want me to undo
her pants. She needs to be home by 11:00 and needs to leave my place
by 10:45. I’m kissing her but opening my eyes at intervals to catch
the clock. At exactly 10:43 I unbutton her Levis and shove my hand
inside, barely undoing the zipper. “I’m in bed...”  
#+END_QUOTE

Now the reader experiences a previous node from a new link that casts
its former meaning into doubt. Is the narrator watching the clock
because she wants to make the most of her time with Jennie, or is she
counting down the minutes until Jennie has to leave? What before
seemed straightforward now appears to support alternate readings. The
reader’s confusion in navigating through /Waves/ relates to the work’s
central theme of narration as seduction, which reinforces an approach
toward queerness as something elusive, a process that will never be
complete. Narration as seduction works by piquing the reader's
interest in the story, propelling her through hyperlinks across the
various nodes, and repeatedly frustrating her desire for closure or
resolution. The reader’s continually thwarted desire for narrative
coherence enacts the themes of sexual discovery and seduction that the
narrator experiences within the space of the story.
 
*** Munoz's queerness as lack

My argument builds off queer theorists who have isolated a core
experience of queerness as displacement, a feeling of a lack, that
creates a space for emergent affects. José Esteban Muñoz articulates
queerness as something "not yet here” (/Cruising Utopia/ 1). Rather
than signify a forward-looking, or future-oriented desire, "not yet
here" suggests a futurity engaged within the present. Munoz explains:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Queerness is /a structuring and educated mode of desiring/ that allows
us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of the present... Queerness is
/a longing/ that propels us onward, beyond romances of the negative
and toiling in the present. Queerness is that thing that lets us feel
that this world is not enough, that indeed /something is
missing/. Emphasis mine, /Cruising Utopia/ 1
#+END_QUOTE

Queerness is defined as being about desire, a "longing that propels us
onward." The ontological nature of queerness is founded in a lack, in
a vacuum. This vacuum results from the political and social
environment that attempts to erase the existence of minorty subjects,
particularly queer people of color. Even as LGBT groups appear to gain
more visibily and acceptance within the intitution of marriage, and
the military and workplaces, Munoz points out that such gains are
trapped within the limiting, normative time of the present. [Queerness
is being wrenched within heteronormative agendas----IE the 2020
surpreme court decision that protects queer desire bc it protects
straight desire].

That queerness being founded in a lack points to a peculiar quality of
queerness that has to do with emergence. Because queerness is "not yet
here," it calls for something else, for something that "allows us to
see and feel beyond the quagmire of the present." In other words,
queerness expands a sensibility of feeling to include sensations
beyond the immediate, the readily sensible. 

*** /confessions/: queerness and the denial of touch
This feeling of the world being "not enough" is what activates the
full sensorium of queer affects. This works through the denial,
deferral, or frustration of touch. For queer subjects, the desire to
touch has always been a frought experience. In /The Confessions of the
Fox/ by Jordy Rosenberg, the main character displays how a troubled
relationship to touch constitutes subjectivity. Set in eighteenth
century London, this story follows Jack Sheppard, a young transgender
male making his way as a wily thief through the London society. In the
time before the pathologization of nonnormative sexual and gender
identities, Sheppard struggles to articulate his difference, what he
calls his "/Something/," from the rest of London society: "This
something that set him apart from other coves [men]. Something that
had caus'd him to dress his own chest in taut bandages... pinching at
his ribs, throttling his every Breath to a forced shallow bird-sipping
of the air" (33). The difficulty with self-identification and
categorization extends from the main character to the narrative's
genre, which unfolds as historical fiction overlaid with contemporary
memoir. Sheppard's story is discovered in the present day by Dr. Voth,
a rueful academic, also transgender, who immediately realizes the
significance of Sheppard's manuscript for the historical record. Voth
proceeds to annotate the document with relevant references and
increasingly, his own anecdotes tangential to the narrative. In one
scene, Sheppard is having a romantic moment with his lover, Bess Khan,
a bi-racial prostitute who initiates Jack into the London underground
society of "rogues," when Voth relates his own story about his former
lover:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
She opened her legs a bit, twitched them open, really. I caught my
breath, audibly.

"Oh my god," she said, "you're such a lesbian."

She didn't mean it cruelly. And she didn't mean that I wasn't passing
as a cis-man, either. Although, since according to her we'd fucked the
night before, she knew exactly how un-cis I was. 

She meant that she saw something about the quality of my desire: that
/I could feel her even before I touched her/ [my emphasis]. And that
this was part of what it meant to be---or to have been, before my tits
became property of the California Municipal Waste Department---a
lesbian. That a woman moving in your line of sight could have an
effect that was total, atmospheric. That you could be hesitant,
incapable, and not particularly interested in establishing a line
between touching and seeing. That you would indulge a dead love, dead
in the eyes of the world, and valueless. A love that choked and
burdened the mind, that might even be the very foundation of
melancholy and despair. But, oh Reader, looking at a woman you really
get a feel for the way that fire is a phenomenon of touch. And my
point is, if you have every been a lesbian, you will not even have to
touch a woman to know that. (169)
#+END_QUOTE

Here, desire is characterised not by the search for satisfaction, or
the success of establishing contact, but by the sensual fullness of a
lack. The experience of desire, of craving, wanting, needing to touch
the desired object stimulates the imagination and amplifies sensations
that would otherwise be replaced with more "direct" modes of
contact. Associating this distinction between imaginary and real
contact to the realm of identity, Dr. Voth's lover refers to him as a
"lesbian," despite his having already transitioned to a male gender
identity. The term fits because it signals not a gender identity but a
/mode of being/ that is more concerned with the visible, which
portends the potential of connection, rather than verifiable
contact. With regard to desire, the difference hinges on the role of
the imagination in activating certain sensors and receptors that
cannot be accessed in the "real," actualized world. Here, fancy takes
on the connotations of the fanciful; desire grows in the
imagination. But this does not mean the sensations resulting from this
desire are any less palpable and sensual; on the contrary, such a
desire heightens and indeed maximizes physical experience. This mode
of desiring is what characterizes queerness in the text: a desire for
something that, because it cannot or will not be fulfilled, amplifies
the fullness of that desire. Touch, or the lack of touch, defines a
peculiarly queer subjectivity in the novel.

In both /Waves/ and /Confessions/, queerness is constituted by a
troubled relationship to touch. In /Waves/, frustrating touch eludes
satisfaction and complicates sexuality. In /Confessions/, maintaining
the gap between sight and touch stimulates the senses beyond what's
possible within normative expectations of sexual desire. The condition
of being continually thwarted gestures at an affect of suspension or
displacement that is central to the experience of queerness, an affect
that we will now explore in depth, which we call the "untouchable.



** the problem: queerness as untouchable 
*** TODO draft estrangement as central to queerness
“Editor’s Introduction”: Queering Archives, Intimate Tracings, 2015:
The estrangement that continually happens with dealing with
queerness. Estrangement from yourself, the materials, and others.

“Estrangement” --- the torment of queer literature -- the pain of not
identification but of not identifying. Of reading the text and finding
and not finding yourself in the pages.

*** TODO reorg disidentification is a clash of affects
Queerness is untouchable. By this I mean that queer subjects cannot be
accessed or known in the same way that majority subjects are within
dominant culture. As readers, identifying with literary subjects is
both dangerous and seducticve. Identities within texts are not stable
across time and place, and acts of identification might collapse or
overlook the complexity of experience. For queer readers in
particular, identification often emerges from a desire to recognize
within the past something that affirms queer experience in the
present. Heather Love describes queer critics, "Like demanding lovers
[who] promise to rescue the past when in fact they dream of being
rescued themselves" (33). Reading in this sense is a search for
reflection, community, or similitude, a link between past and
present. This chapter borrows a theory of identity developed by Queer
Theorists from mostly Latinx backgrounds and traditions, particularly
Muñoz, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Ofelia Schutte. The work of these
theorists, as well as that of Chela Sandoval, Norma Alarcón and Audre
Lorde, all radical feminists of color, coalesce around a paradigm of
identity formation that Muñoz describes as "identities-in-difference"
(/Disidentifications/ 6). Muñoz's identities-in-difference marshalls
theories of difference that center moments of failed interpellation,
misfitting, and unbelonging as the core materials of identity
formation.

Due to the effects of what Muñoz calls the "cultural logics of
heteronormativity, white supremacy, and misogyny," queer people of
color have been placed outside majority ideas about race, sexuality,
gender, and class, that constitute dominant society
(/Disidentifications/ 5). As a result, minority experience is defined
by a gap in identification, where the minority subject emerges in the
failure to adhere to social expectations. Within this gap, dominant
signfications of identity do not remain totally inaccessible to
minority subjects. Rather, they are accessed according to a process of
"disidentification," where subjects find alternative pathways of
connection to that which remains beyond their grasp. These moments can
be fleeting sensations of finding oneself attracted to something that
is inappropriate, "to read onesself and one's own life narrative in a
moment, object, or subject that is not culturally coded to 'connect'
with the disidentifying subject" (/Disidentifications/ 12). Muñoz
offers his own formative experience of disidentification from a
childhood memory of watching Truman Capote on TV:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I remember, for instance, seeing an amazingly queeny Truman Capote
describe the work of fellow writer Jack Kerouac as not writing but,
instead, typing. I am certain that my pre-out consciousness was
completely terrified by the swishy spectacle of Capote's
performance. But I also remember feeling a deep pleasure in hearing
Capote make language, in "getting" the fantastic bitchiness of his
quip. Like Gomez, I can locate that experience of suburban
spectatorship as having a disidentificatory impact on me. Capote's
performance was as exhilarating as it was
terrifying. /Disidentifications/ 4
#+END_QUOTE

This memory is distinguished by a powerful disjunction between
opposite feelings, which consitutes identity from ambivalent
affects. The exhilaration that Muñoz feels when he understands
Capote's dig, the surprise of grasping its "fanstastic bitchiness," is
attended by an alternative affect, one of fear of recognition. In this
process, identification emerges in the space between these opposing
sensations---pleasure and terror.

Acts of disidentification can be shattering. In "The Torment of Queer
Literature," Kelly Caldwell explains the quandry of reading James
Baldwin's /Giovanni's Room/ as a transgender woman: "what if the only
available act of identification is one of stigma and shame? Embracing
queerness is often embracing abjection. Sometimes identification is
loss and despair" (par. 4). Identification tends to center around
these "bad feelings" which offer less fodder for political
resistence. However, identification with more positive aspects of
queer experience is hardly an alternative. For many readers, the more
redemptive or celebratory narratives offer no consolation. The reader
is stuck between recognizing their own pain or feeling guilty for not
recognizing pleasure: "Either read a book like /Giovanni’s Room/ at
the risk of recognizing David’s denial and repression as my own, or
read a book that celebrates queer lives and sex boldly and end up
despising my own cowardice" (par. 17).

**** Anzaldua's choque is a manifestation of incommensurability 
This sensation of opposing affects has been well explored by queer
Chicana Theorists Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga. Anzaldúa's
figure of /la mestiza/, or mixed woman, drawn from Mexican philosopher
Jose Vasconcelos's promotion of "una raza mestiza" [the mixed race],
emphasizes hybridity as a structuring component of identity. Mestizaje
is the experience of being mixed, at the intersection of two opposing
forces, "Cradled in one culture, sandwiched between two cultures,"
being able to contain dualities, such as male/female, English/Spanish,
American/Mexican (78 in old). Mestiza consciousness, for Anzaldúa, is
a tolerance for ambiguity, for existing in the middle space. This
consciousness is characterized by what Anzaldúa calls the experience
of /el choque/: "The coming together of two self-consistent but
habitually incompatible frames of referencee causes /un choque/, a
cultural collision" (78 in old book). The affective experience of /el
choque/ or the /shock/ consists of a bodily phenomenon where the
subject receives multiple opposing messages that incite a physical
upheaval. Anzaldúa explains that "the clash of voices results in
mental and emotional states of perplexity... The mestiza's dual or
multiple personality is plagued by psychic restlessness" (78 in old
book). This physical upheaval is the ground from which the mestiza
builds identity: "The new mestiza copes by developing a tolerance for
contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity. She learns to be an Indian
in Mexican culture, to be Mexican from an Anglo point of view.  She
learns to juggle cultures" (79 in old book).

**** Disidentification points to the incommensurable: schutte
The disjunction that occurs in acts of queer disidentification results
from the condition of queer identity being ultimately inaccessible, or
"untouchable." Queer identity is untouchable because experience and
subjectivity of minoritarian subjects are incommensurable. Latina
feminist philosopher Ofelia Schutte poses the concept of the
"incommensurable" to explore the question of cross-cultural
communication between dominant and subaltern subjects. Writing
specifically about communication between native English and Spanish
speakers, Schutte wonders how subjects from different cultures might
achieve effective conversation. She finds that they cannot, as "no two
cultures or languages can be perfectly transparent to each other"
(56). There will always be something lost in translation, "a residue
of meaning that will not be reached in cross-cultural endeavors"
(56). This residue is what she calls the "incommensurable," a vestige
of communication that fails to transfer between subaltern and dominant
subjects. Schutte draws from feminist postcolonial and
poststructuralist concepts of alterity and difference to present a
view of subjectivity in which "the other is that person or experience
which makes it possible for the self to recognize its own limited
horizons in the light of asymmetrically given relations marked by
sexual, social, cultural, or other differences" (54). The effect of
"incommensurability," then, is not to try to grasp or translate the
vestige of lost meaning, but to recognize that gap as a space that
constitutes subjectivity. It is to "look at nodes in a linguistic
interchange or a conversation in which the other's speech, or some
aspect of it, resonates in me as a kind of strangeness, as a kind of
displacement of the usual expectation" (56). Schutte proposes that one
embrace the strangeness of communication, locating the moments where
meaning seems to slip by and elude us. By paying attention to the
awkward and even bizarre moments of misunderstanding, we find the
materials for constructing new dis(identity).

Getting in touch with the /choque/ is a great challenge for minority
subjects, and an even greater challenge for cross-cultural
communication. Cherríe Moraga points out that "it is not really
difference the oppressor fears so much as similarity" (La Guera,
30). The minority subject contains incommensurable elements that are
not legible by dominant society. These elements are not only
neglected, but avoided by society, because confronting the "stranger
within" is a psychologically painful process. Schutte goes into detail
to explain how the incommensurable operates in conversation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In cross-cultural communication, each speaker may "say" something that
falls on the side of the "unsaid" for a culturally differentiated
interlocutor. Such gaps in communication may cause one speaker's
discourse to appear incoherent or insufficiently organized. To the
culturally dominant speaker, the subaltern speaker's discourse may
appear to be a string of fragmented observations rather than a unified
whole. The actual problem may not be incoherence but the lack of
cultural translatability of the signifiers for coherence from one set
of cultural presuppositions to the other. 62
#+END_QUOTE

As Muñoz points out, "The fiction of identity is one that is accessed
with relative ease by most majoritarian subjects"
(/Disidentifications/ 5). Subjects from dominant society can avoid
entirely engaging in minority discourse. Schutte explains that "The
speaker from the dominant culture is basically saying: communicate
with me entirely on the terms I expect; beyond this, I am not
interested" (62). Confronting the incommensurable is difficult because
it requires them to step temporarily into the place of the "other",
"that person or experience which makes it possible for the self to
recognize its own limited horizons in the light of asymmetrically
given relations marked by sexual, social, cultural, or other
differences" (Schutte 54).

The feeling of incommensurability---of something missing,
misunderstood, or misfitting---is central to queer experience.

*** TODO draft reading practices try to resolve incommens: Amin & Musser
The illusion that we can gain sufficient knowledge into queer
experience, that such experiences are “commensurable,” drives certain
reading practices that critics describe as “paranoid” or “suspicious.

if reality/experience/communication is incommensurable, what does this
mean about our relationship to knowledge? 

The reality of incommensurability points to ways that knowledge will
always be flawed, never complete, never self-evident. As a result, the
illusion that we can gain sufficient knowledge into queer experience,
that such experiences are “commensurable,” drives certain reading
practices that critics describe as “paranoid” or “suspicious.” This is
what is violent about analysis, the assumptions that we make about
others being fundamentally different and fundamentally knowable.
- The tyranny of the visual: “At their base, such operations of
  surveillance and classification rely on the concept of immutable
  difference, on sharp boundaries, and on the possibility of
  exhaustively knowing the other” (Amin, Kadji, Amber Jamilla Musser,
  and Roy Pérez “Queer Form: Aesthetics, Race, and the Violences of
  the Social” ASAP/Journal, Volume 2, Number 2, May 2017, pp. 232).

In Haraway's words, a search for the "one code that translates all
meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism" (Simians,
Cyborgs, and Women 176).

*** TODO revise paranoia: sedgwick
-> smooth transition from incommensurability to paranoia. 

Paranoid reading practices deliver results that are imaginable within
given knowledge structures. To illustrate this effect, Sedgwick
relates a conversation between herself and a friend during few years
of the AIDS crisis, when speculation about the government's complicity
in spreading the virus is rampant. At the time, Sedgwick wonders
whether "the lives of African Americans are worthless in the eyes of
the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where
they aren't actively hated" (123). Her friend counters this suspicion,
pointing out that knowledge of conspiracy doesn't achieve anything on
its own: "Supposing we were ever sure of all those things---what would
we know then that we don't already know?" (123). Merely knowing that
something is true, revealing the presence of systematic oppression,
injustice, discrimination, does nothing. As Sedgwick explains,
knowledge of a problem is not enough to "enjoin that person to any
specific train of epistemological or narrative consequences"
(123). Moreover, a paranoid or suspicious stance blocks out other
possibilities for relation to the text. Paranoia often only affirms
itself; reflecting and replicating itself in every surface, giving too
much power to the act of exposure. The work of paranoia is never done,
"for all its vaunted suspicion, [paranoia] acts as though its work
would be accomplished if only it could finally, this time, somehow get
its story truly known" (141). Like many other theorists, Sedgwick
wonders what is the point of continually trying to reveal, unravel,
deconstruct the injustices of the past. She searches for "some ways of
understanding human desire that might be quite to the side of
prohibition and repression, that might hence be structured quite
differently from the heroic, 'liberatory,' inescapably dualistic
righteousness of hunting down and attacking prohibition/repression in
all its chameleonic guises" (10).

*** TODO add Scott & Kazanjian on overreading
-> the way that literary critics approach vision vs other fields

Scott, Joan. “The Evidence of Experience”:
- Using experience for evidence rather than thinking about how experience is shaped. Scott talks about representation, about looking at experience, at the vision, the optical effects, for what they suggest. The beautiful reading of Samuel Delany’s vision of the “millions of gay men” the fantastical projection (rather than real identity) that suggests a political consciousness. Historiography is about modes of seeing.  
- Experience is always mediated for literary critics. We never take a
text as referential---there is rhetoric and form. 

David Kazanjian, “Scenes of Speculation,” Social Text 33:4 (2015),
77-84.

The charge of “overreading” -- the idea that we are attributing a
contemporary meaning to a historical text. This presumes a strict
separation between historically contextualized reading and ahistorical
reading, saying that we can read as if we are in the same situation as the writer. Kazanjian calls for overreading “for scenes of speculation”  When we make historicist readings, we end up “making theoretical claims about the who in question, claims that imply or assert a theory of the subject”, in which they have a self-conscious will or desire (81). Every historicist reading is implies a level of imposition by the reader. 

Kazanjian suggests that we attend less to the wills, desires, and
voices of historical subjects and more to the textual traces which invite speculative work.  “Unfinished recovery [of the archives] is the very condition of possibility for their ongoing interpretation” (83). 
→ what are we trying to solve? 
*** paranoia and replication: haraway

In order to understand the ways that the paranoid impulse harm and
constrain inquiry, it is useful to view it at work in scientific
disciplines. Some strains of scientific inquiry, in particular, show
us how paranoia enacts a self-replicating mechanic. Though it appears
in much of literary studies, the impulse that drives paranoid reading
is borrowed from a critical viewpoint in scientific inquiry that
assumes a detached observer. Critiques of this position, particularly
in Donna Haraway's work on primatology, attempt to articulate a new
mode of feminist science that de-naturalizes the "natural." Haraway's
research on primates reveals the ways in which assumptions and
preconceptions from the (white, male) subject inflect the object of
study. She examines how scientists bring their own investments to bear
even in the seemingly benign questions they might ask, or qualities
they isolate, as areas of interest. For example, primatologists
working with the goal of studying social structures in the field often
impose their own social structures by turning their assumptions of
male dominance into "observations." Feminist scientists attempt to
revise such narratives by emphasizing organization and cooperation
among primate communities: "revisionists have stressed matrifocal
groups, long-term social cooperation rather than short-term
spectacular aggression, flexible process rather than strict structure”
(19). Pointing out that, “Women know very well that knowledge from the
natural sciences has been used in the interests of our domination and
not our liberation," Harwaway asserts that such revision is about
empowering the subjugated, reconceiving “female receptivity” as
"female choice" (8). The creation of a subject/object split
/reproduces/ and legitimizes hierarchies of domination.

Oftentimes, new tools can obscure the ways that we replicate our own
assumptions. The advent of photography in the mid-nineteenth century
allowed subjects to codify their prejudices as science, for example,
in the pictures of American slaves taken by Louis Agassiz
in 1850. These daguerrotypes, a pioneering practice in photography
that uses light-sensitive chemicals on silver plates, show how the
impulse for scientific classification impacts the quality and kind of
knowledge that results. Agassiz, a Swiss anthropologist, came to the
United States to study the physical differences between European
whites and African blacks, by examining the shape and character of
their heads and torsos, similar to contemporary studies in physionomy
and phrenology that analyzed the exterior form of the human
body. Agassiz's goal was to amass evidence to support his theory, that
mankind had been separately created and whites and blacks were in fact
different species (Wallis 40). Using photography for anthropoligical
purposes, and organizing photographs to support a classification
system, Agassiz's work demonstrates how the apparent "objectivity" of
the photograph can mask the highly subjective motives for
classification. Writing about the photographs, which were exhibited by
the Amon Carter Museum in 1992, Brian Wallis explains that such images
were organized to suggest divisions between "self and other, healthy
and diseased, normal and pathological," with the insidious effect of
"mask[ing] its subjective distortions in the guise of logic and
organization" (Wallis 47, 54-55). The problem, Wallis points out, is
the realism of the photographic tool obscures the ways that subjects
harness it to solidify their preconceptions---"Strengthened by the
seeming transparency of photographic realism, these categories and the
divisions between them soon took on the authority of natural 'facts.'
Supplying either too much or too little information, photographs soon
muddied the easy distinctions between subjective knowledge and what
was called "objective." (47-48). The more seeminly transparent the
tool, the easier it is to wrangle it toward proving "self-evident"
truths.

In this case, the apparent fidelity of the photographic tool to record
"nature" in fact obscures the ways that using the tool only reinforces
a preconceived notion of "nature." Wallis explains that, "Supplying
either too much or too little information, photographs soon muddied
the easy distinctions between subjective knowledge and what was called
'objective' (48). The photographs reinforce the ways that scientific
tools, which appear to capture "reality," can be harnessed and
manipulated toward the observer's purpose. 

*** TODO add Barad on replication / representationalism
*** TODO revise paranoia and recovery: hartmanm

Not only does paranoid inquiry tend to replicate the assumptions of
the observer, but it blocks out other forms of knowledge. This is
especially evident in the work of historical recovery, in the impulse
to find "hidden" or "forgotten" meaning in textual and archival
material. Recovery works by a self-legitimizing and perpetuating logic
that attempts to render what has been left out, disregarded, or
misunderstood within the logic of dominance. It is Jacques Derrida's
/archive fever/, or the desire for legibility, under the auspices of
the ruler, which animates the endless search for origins. It is, in
Haraway's words, a search for the "one code that translates all
meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism" (/Simians,
Cyborgs, and Women/ 176).

The stakes of recovery work are uniquely stark in the history of the
Black Atlantic, where researchers must work to square the growth of an
inhuman practice within a historical narrative of progress and
liberalization. A tradition that rationalizes slavery with the right
to property, that justifies war through the social contract. Black
Atlantic scholars Lisa Lowe and Saidiya Hartman point out that the
central paradox of studying the archive of slavery is the structuring
condition of recovery. In her essay "History Hesitant," Lowe explains
that because recovery work necessarily occurs within the limits of the
authorizing power, it always subjects itself to that power. Rather
that work under these conditions, historians of enslaved experience
ought to examine this confining structure, "the archeology of
knowledge through which the archive subjects and governs precisely by
means of instruments that absent the humanity of the enslaved”
(87). Researchers might examine, for example, how "the slave trader’s
desire to record, measure, list, and account" weigh up against
"rationalist claims to produce truth or meaning about the terrors of
captivity, enslavement, or torture" (88). Saidiya Hartman similarly
turns to the question of epistemology as the crux of the recovery
work: “If it is no longer sufficient to expose the scandal, then how
might it be possible to generate a different set of descriptions from
this archive?" (7).

Hartman's central problem is what to do with an absent archive. She
leaves us the paradox of recovery work: "How does one revisit the
scene of subjection without replicating the grammar of violence?"
(4). Hartman writes caustically about the impossibility of telling
stories that have been left out of the record. Not only that we can
never recover these stories (they are lost to time) but we can not
approximate them with our current tools, with language. In "Venus in
Two Acts," Hartman tells the story of Black Venus, the unnamed slave
woman who appears variously throughout the "offical" record:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
we could have as easily encountered her in a ship’s ledger in the
tally of debits; or in an overseer’s journal—--“last night I laid with
Dido on the ground”; or as an amorous bed-fellow with a purse so
elastic “that it will contain the largest thing any gentleman can
present her with” in Harris’s List of Covent- Garden Ladies; or as the
paramour in the narrative of a mercenary soldier in Surinam; or as a
brothel owner in a traveler’s account of the prostitutes of Barbados;
or as a minor character in a nineteenth-century pornographic novel. 1
#+END_QUOTE

What draws all these iterations of Venus together is their silence,
"no one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or
observed that she refused to say anything at all" (2). The fact of
silence cuts deeper than the failure of history but is part of the
condition known as the "violence of the archive," which denotes not
only absence as a form of evidence, in that the physical records are
missing, but also in the tools of expression, in language that cannot
approximate the reality of experience, and in the audible discourse
that dictates silence.
an
*** Queerness irrecoverable, but tempting ID: Love

Heather Love offers a reading strategy that acknowledges queer
experience, particularly suffering, as unconsoleable. In resisting the
temptations to redeem psychic suffering by queer subjects, Heather
Love offers a strategy called "feeling-backward." This strategy opens
a space for bad feelings without trying to recuscitate, justify, or
transform them. She focuses on feelings such as "nostalgia, regret,
shame, despair, /ressentiment/, passivity escapism, self-hatred,
withdrawal, bitterness, defeatism, and loneliness," which, according
to Love, are tied to "the historical impossibility of same-sex desire"
(4, emphasis original). She examines the burdened protagonists from
famous modernist texts like Walter Pater's /The Renaissance: Studies
in Art and Poetry/ (1873), Radclyffe Hall's /The Well of Loneliness/
(1928), Willa Cather's /My Ántonia/ (1918), and Sylvia Townsend
Warner's /Summer Will Show/ (1936). Love argues that the shame and
stigma experienced by these characters ought to be recognized rather
than resolved. Instead of turning negative histories into sites of
resistance or affirmation, these hurting characters might have full
reign over their own darkness. And this darkness must be where the
critic will meet them.

The more hopeless and resistant queer subjects make for more tempting
identifications. Love explains how these subjects remain beyond the
reader's grasp: "As queer readers we tend to see ourselves as reaching
back toward isolated figures in the queer past in order to rescue or
save them. It is hard to know what to do with texts that resist our
advances" (8). The reason that these subjects remain so unreachable
has to do with the nature of queerness itself, which represents
absence, loss, and failure. Love illustrates this quality by evoking a
Greek myth, Orpheus and Eurydice, in which the lover botches his
beloved's rescue by looking back at her as they exit the
underworld. Love quotes from Maurice Blanchot's account of the story
in "The Gaze of Orpheus," to describe what Orpheus searches for in the
prohibited and doomed glance backward:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
Not to look would be infidelity to the measureless, imprudent force
of his movement, which does not want Eurydice in her daytime truth and
in her everyday appeal, but wants her in her nocturnal obscurity, in
her distance, with her closed body and sealed face---wants to see her
not when she is visible, but when she is invisible, and not as the
intimacy of familiar life, but as the foreignness of what excludes all
intimacy, and wants, not to make her live, but to have living in her
the plenditude of death. 50
#+END_QUOTE 

Orpheus's downfall is his desire for a glimpse at what cannot be
grapsed, at what remains beyond the light. This desire is not for
"daytime truth" but for "noctural obscurity," which is always receding
at the moment of pursuit. Like Eurydice, queerness emerges only to
slip away, turning its face from the parched gaze. Can we be blamed
for looking for that which cannot be grasped? No, because queerness
has always been structured by that which is not, by what Love calls
"impossible love" (24). Not only is queerness projected to fail, it is
a project of failure. Love reminds us that "Queer history has been an
education in absence" (50). In learning failure and loss, queer
readers can only identify with what they have been taught to recognize
as untouchable. Full identification, like Eurydice in the daylight, is
prevented by design.

*** TODO revise hesitation, critical distance is necessary: Lowe
-> To avoid paranoid methods we develop a critical distance, we turn to
the ways that "touch" can be distanced. 

Within the dominant culture, recovery means authorizing the structures
of knowledge that give rise to injustice in the first place. So what
do we do now? There are affects associated with this kind of
impasse. We hold ourselves back, restraint, avoidance. Lowe explains
that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hesitation, rather than rushing to recover what has been
lost, need not be understood as inaction or postponement, or as a
thwarting of the wish to provide for a future world. Rather, it halts
the desire for recognition by the present social order and staves off
the compulsion to make visible within current epistemological
orthodoxy. 98
#+END_QUOTE

Feelings of hesitation, doubt, dissapointment are ways of protecting
the archive of slavery from further exploitation.

To sum up: one solution to paranoid impulses involves is critical
awareness, the ability to access the affects that come between you and
the object of study. 

The archivist must work within the discrepancy between reality and the
historical record. Hartman's goal is "to expose and exploit the
incommensurability between the experience of the enslaved and the
fictions of history... the requirements of narrative, the stuff of
subjects and plots and ends" (10).

*** TODO cut/revise post-critical reading: sedgwick & felski 
**** Felski on the illusion of emotional detachment:

The reality is that we are stuck in these bodies of our thinking. Rita
Felski describes how seemingly neutral and detatched critical stance
belies an emotional disposition:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Scholars like to think that their claims stand or fall on the merits
of their reasoning and the irresistible weight of their evidence, yet
they also adopt a low-key affective tone that can bolster or
drastically diminish their allure. Critical detachment, in this light,
is not an absence of mood but one manifestation of it---a certain
orientation toward one's subject, a way of making one's argument
matter. 6
#+END_QUOTE

The "low-key affective tone" of scholarly discourse suggests that
affect, and the feeling subject associated with it, has been left out
of the critical process. However, appealing to the apparently
unemotional does not succeed in removing emotion from argument---this
is impossible---but it does reinforce the illusion that emotions don't
belong in rational thought. Actually they do---though the emotions of
critical discourse are of a quality and degree that mask their own
presence. Felski explains that, “Rather than an ascetic exercise in
demystification, suspicious reading turns out to be a style of thought
infused with a range of passions and pleasures, intense engagements
and eager commitments” (9). One follows the exposition of the framing
paradigms, the twists and turns of the driving question, the climax of
of discovery followed by the of denouement of the conclusion, one
immediately senses the full dramatic repertoire of critical
inquiry. 

And the illusion of reason as being devoid of emotion is not limited
to verbal discourse. It also pervades--perhaps even more
insidiously---the apparently objective reprsentations data
visualization. Graphs, charts, and maps all contain persuasive
elements that succeed through their invisibility, in the trust, for
example, that the souces are truthfully represented in the
visualization or the implied preference of some metrics over
others. Lauren Klein and Catherine D'Ignazio point out that "so-called
'neutral' visualizations that do not appear to have an editorial
hand... might even be the most perniciously persuasive visualizations
of all!" (/Data Feminism/, chapter 2). Not dots on a graph can be said
to be removed from the predelictions of the creator and the generosity
of the viewer.

**** Felski & Sedgwick affective approaches

Critics like Rita Felski and Eve Sedgwick adopt an alternative
approach toward reading that exposes knowledge as derived from
embodied experience. Felski talks about reading as an affective
orientation, where readers position themselves and their desires
around texts. Felski critiques the popular orientation in literary
criticism centered on what Paul Riceour has called the “hermeneutics
of suspicion”---the desire to unmask and demystify the secrets of
literary works. According to Felski, critics generally behave as if
language is always withholding some truth, that the critic’s task is
to reveal the unsaid or repressed. She identifies the affective modes
of suspicion to include disenchantment, vigilance, paranoia. 

Sedgwick makes a similar assertion about tendencies of "paranoid
reading," though she bases her critique on Michele Foucault's
repressive hypothesis from his /History of Sexuality, Vol. 1/, which
approaches discussions on sex and sexuality through the lense of
repression or prohibition. Rather than excavating the workings of the
repressive hypothesis, Foucault is interested in the ways that
discourse on sex has proliferated, in its multiplications that avoid
censure while satisfying the desire for sexual discourse. Left with no
place to go, discussion on sex simply continued to spread by
transforming itself into palatable discourses such as Marxism,
pyschoanalytic, libertarian, etc. By looking for the specter of
sex/power dynamics in these discourses, Foucault seems to work outside
the logic of the repressive hypothesis. But this is not the
case. Sedgwick explains that, "the almost delirious promise of the
book" is "the suggestion that there might be ways of thinking around
[the repressive hypothesis]" (9). In fact, Sedgwick explains that
Foucault's inquiry has been, from the start, structured by repression
and prohibition. She finds that the "critical analysis of repression
is itself inseparable from repression" (10). 

Felski and Sedgwick see a dead end in militant reading practices. 

Felski's nightmare: 
Sedgwick's wish: 

"How do we step outside the repressive hypothesis "to forms of thought
that would not be structured by the question of prohibition in the
first place?" (/Touching Feeling/ 11).

Speaking on Foucault's repressive hypothesis: "I knew what I wanted
from it: some ways of understanding human desire that might be quite
to the side of prohibition and repression, that might hence be
structured quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory',
inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting down and attacking
prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic guises" (/Touching
Feeling/ 10).

Felski shows how this suspicion toward texts forecloses other possible
readings while providing no guarantee of rigorous or radical
thought. Rather than adopt a suspicious attitude, Felski suggests that
literary scholars try “postcritical reading," which looks to what the
text suggests or makes possible. Felski wonders what if we allowed
ourselves to be marked or struck by what we read. Then, rather than
just be a cognitive activity, reading can become an “embodied mode of
attentiveness that involves us in acts of sensing, perceiving,
feeling, registering, and engaging” (176).

Reading is about movement 


Postcritical Reading --- "Reading, in this light, is a matter of
attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging links between
things that were previously unconnected”… “Reading, in this sense, is
not just a cognitive activity but an embodied mode of attentiveness
that involves us in acts of sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering,
and engaging” (176).

**** Sedgwick on generative shame
What if we read Henry James mobilizing shame as a creative resource?
  For many queer people, shame is a structuring force in their
  identity. But this doesn’t mean we need to be negative, we can look
  to the ways that shame unlocks creativity and productivity---to the
  ways that metaphors are made possible through shame. James’
  “blushing”, “flushing” is linked to a fantasy of the skin being
  entered, or touched by a hand. GLOVE, GAGE, GAGEURE…  We can reclaim
  a negative affect of shame and approach it as a generative force.
- "Shame interests me politically, then, because it generates and
  legitimates the place of identity--the question of identity--at the
  origin of the impulse to the performative, but does so without
  giving that identity space the standing of an essence. It
  constitutes the as-to-be-constituted, which is also to say, as
  already there for the (necessary, productive) misconstrual and
  misrecognition. Shame--living, as it does, on and in the face--seems
  to be uniquely contagious from one person to another. And the
  contagiousness of shame is only facilitated by its anamorphic,
  protean susceptibility to new expressive grammars" (63).

*** TODO draft the dimensions of touch: anzaldua
--> the challenge is to regain touch without resolving it--overcoming
impulse of subj/obj divides. how do we touch without presuming full
connections? the answer is through abstraction, formalization,
opacity...

Touch reconciles the inherent connection between bodies, something
that heteronormativity tries to suppress. For things to not touch, to
be severed or "objectified," moves them into a relation of
violence. Gloria Anzaldua explains that separation is brutal: "In
trying to become 'objective,' Western culture made 'objects' of things
and people when it distanced itself from them, thereby losing 'touch'
with them. This dichotomy is the root of all violence" (37). Losing
touch is a prerequisite for exploitation. The sundering of "objects"
from our touch primes us to take advantage of them. Colonial history
is a case study in losing touch: "White America has only attended to
the body of the earth in order to exploit it, never to succor it or to
be nurtured in it" (68). Anzaldua's /mestiza/, birthed in the open
wound of the border, "where the Third World grates against the first
and bleeds," is an attempt to bring together what has been separated
(3). Those who live on the border know better than anyone--divisions
between bodies puts those bodies into conflict.

Touch offers myriad ways of relation. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick offers
touch as a way of connecting to objects that evades "dualistic
thought," that is, in "binary" thought, where things are presumed to
be discrete and opposed. 

"But it is not enough to stand on the opposite river bank, shouting
questions,. challenging patriarchal, white conventions.  A
counterstance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked
in mortal ,combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to
a common denominator of violence... At some point, on our way to a new
consciousness, we will have to leave the opposite bank, the split
between the two mortal combatants somehow healed so that we are on
both shores at once and, at once, see through serpent and eagle eyes"
(Anzaldúa 78-79 in old book).

In short, for queer bodies, there is a dual impulse, a desire to touch
and be touched that coexists with the inability for touch to satisfy,
provide redemption, or avoid violation. Respecting the right not to be
touched, some queer theorists pursue critical methods that prevent
overidentification or overanalysis. They resist reading practices,
which have been called "suspicious reading" or "paranoid
reading"[fn:4], that seek to expose the effects of homophobic
prohibition and repression with the goal of affirming queer subjects
or recuperating their losses. Paranoid or suspicious reading is
oriented around finding and exposing the pain and shame of the closet
in order to turn them into sites of political resistance, liberation,
or pride.

This leads us to the main problem with touch: it goes both ways. What
I touch also touches me; one body impressed by or in collision with
another. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick explains that "the sense of touch makes
nonsense out of any dualistic understanding of agency and passivity;
to touch is always already to reach out, to fondle, to heft, to tap,
or to enfold" (13). Touch engages a range of relations where power is
not always reduced to opposition. The sensation of touch often
obscures this dual effect. Some bodies appear to desire touching
rather than being touched; sometimes, the desire for touch does not
seek contact, but the fullness of desiring.  it is bidirectional,
reveals a subject/object divide.

*** TODO refine /feeling backward/ as touching at a distance
--> Love offers a model of "feeling backward" which is a way for critics
to connect with queer subjects in a way that keeps objects out of the
critic's reach. 

Love proposes a method in which the goal is not to redeem queer
subjects or resolve queer failure. Rather, the problem of
identification is turned to a reading strategy: "I want to suggest a
mode of historiography that recognizes the inevitability of a 'play of
recogniztions,' but that also sees these recognitions not as consoling
but as shattering" (45). Reading, for Love, can enact a "play of
recognitions," which is a way of making fleeting connections that do
not presume complete understanding. It is a way of identifying, but
not fully. Full identification would attempt to wrench the subject
from its suffering, and effectively transform it into something
else. Rather that attempt to rescusitate it, Love looks to the ways
that identity unsettles and dissolves subjectivity. She gives the
example of Stephen Gordon from Radclyffe Hall's /The Well of
Loneliness/. Once considered too depressing as a model of lesbianism,
recent critics have cast Stephen Gordon as a transgender figure. Love
resists this label, maintaining that Stephen is “beyond the reach of
such redemptive narratives” (119). The question, for Love, is not
whether Stephen is a pre-op FTM (Female-to-Male), but how Stephen’s
existential negativity can be read as an embodied phenonmenon, as “a
social experience insistently internalized and corporeal” (108).



** solutions: abstraction, formalization, opacity
*** TODO refine reparative reading is active
   
We might explore, with Sedgwick, "forms of thought that would not be
structured by the question of prohibition" (11). Sedgwick points that
that critical inquiry might work within a /reparative/ methodology,
which opens room for interpretive possibilities and attention to
positive affects like love, gratitude, and affection. This method
welcomes surprise of discovery over affirmation. It prioritizes "local
theories and nonce taxonomies" over totalizing perspectives (145). We
might approach criticism as having to do with /movement/ rather than
/knowledge/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[M]oving from the rather fixated question Is a particular piece of
knowledge true, and how can we know? to further questions: What does
knowledge /do/---the pursuit of it, the having and exposing of it, the
receiving again of knowledge of what one already knows? How, in short,
is knowledge /performative/, and how best does one move among its
causes and effects?" (my italics, 124)
#+END_QUOTE

This reorienation of knowledge as /active/, as performative, opens up
the critical process to one that is mobile and and speculative rather
than suspicious. Moreover, it draws attention to the ways that
knowledge is embodied, with all the surprises and discoveries that
embodiment entails. 
*** TODO cut Waves on movement

The reader’s experience of frustration and desire in navigating
through the story mirrors the themes of sexual frustration and desire
within the story. The electronic format of the story is what allows
this theme to surface, for me. As I follow this disorienting
narrative, I similarly enter into cycles of desire and
frustration. This affective reaction is only possible through a
displacement---a formal displacement that uses electronic media to
re-organize, re-structure and display the story in the way we
encounter it.

Larry McCaffery, the fiction judge who awarded Fisher the ELO prize,
praises the hyperfiction’s use of fragmentation to present anecdotes,
bits of story and meditations in a way that liberates the story’s
potential: "Fisher creates an interconnected web of branching,
narrative possibilities" (“Comments”). Rather than feel paralyzed by
the variety of options, McCafferty regards such options as liberating
the traditionally pre-determined text into something more malleable,
and therefore, more relatable, to the reader. Jessica Laccetti also
lauds Waves’ indeterminate reading experience, saying that it cannot
have defined beginnings, section divisions, or endings. Each time the
reader sits down and opens this hypertext, it is different; depending
on the chosen order of node, the reader will derive new meaning from
that reading. She argues that, “as the narrative sequencing changes,
so does our understanding of reading” (180). By constantly rearranging
the order of its nodes, hyperfictions like Waves creates new, unique
narratives, “enabl[ing] numerous possibilities for beginnings and,
therefore, sequentialities” (Laccetti 180).

Roland Barthes offers a theory about the reader’s affective response
to the text that illuminates how hypertext may use linking as a
narrative strategy to engage, rather than dissuade, the reader. In The
Pleasure of the Text, Barthes describes two ways that texts provoke
reactions by appealing to the reader’s “readerly” or “writerly”
faculties. The text may stimulate pleasure or bliss in the reader
depending on the degree to which its language disrupts his reading
experience. On the one hand, the text of pleasure, or the “readerly”
text, is “the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the text
that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a
comfortable practice of reading” (all italics original; 14).  The text
of bliss, the “writerly” text, on the other hand, is one “that imposes
a state of loss, the text that discomforts (perhaps to the point of a
certain boredom), unsettles the reader’s historical, cultural,
psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values,
memories, brings to a crisis his relation with language” (14). The
important difference here is the extent to which the text stimulates
affects that actively push the reader away or disrupt his reading. The
text of pleasure operates according to the principles of narrative
suspense that drive traditional stories, like cause and effect, while
the text of bliss negates these principles: “what pleasure wants is
the site of loss, the seam, the cut, the deflation, the dissolve which
seizes the subject in the midst of bliss” (Barthes 7). In other words,
the text of bliss is an interruption of the comfortable reading
experience that emphasizes the reader’s position as a
subject. According to Barthes, the text of bliss is a positive
experience for the reader insofar as he enjoys this interruption: “the
subject gains access to bliss by the cohabitation of languages working
side by side: the text… is a sanctioned babel” (4). Barthes
description here applies nicely to the structure of hypertext fiction,
in which different texts are embedded quite literally side by side in
the form of hyperlinks: insofar as the reader “sanctions” these texts,
he will experience them as texts of bliss.

 From its table of contents, the novella foregrounds the reader’s
agency in navigating through its fragmentary structure, where the
reader encounters a navigation page that lists eight main sections, or
chapters, of the narrative. These sections are named “kissing girls,”
“school tales,” “I want her,” “city,” “country,” “she was warned,”
“dare,” and “her collections.” When the reader pans over each chapter
title, a textual blurb appears containing an excerpt from that
chapter, which often draw from a sexual episode that stimulate
reader's interest in that chapter, enticing her onward. For example,
the excerpt for “I want her” presents an erotic moment between the
narrator and one of her lovers, Jennie.:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I’m in bed with Jennie Winchester and I realize she want me to undo
her pants. She needs to be home by 11:00 and needs to leave my place
by 10:45. I’m kissing her but opening my eyes at intervals to catch
the clock. At exactly 10:43 I unbutton her Levis and shove my hand
inside, barely undoing the zipper. “I’m in bed...”
#+END_QUOTE

The narrator severs the excerpt at a moment of climax, tempting the
reader to click through to the next node. Another section heading,
“dare,” displays a similar strategy: “Fay Devlin and I are playing
spin the bottle. She spins, but she trembles. By the time we get to
Truth or Dare, I have my lips on her nipple and I’ve made her do the
asking” (“These Waves of Girls…”). These excerpts establish the
reader’s agency and the novel’s fragmentary structure from the outset
of the novella. Because the chapters are unnumbered, the reader must
determine how to proceed through the sections of the novella by making
decisions about which to read first. These previews function to entice
the reader to click through to read the rest of that section. And
while the table of contents hints at the existence of an underlying
structure to the narrative, that structure also reveals itself to be
founded on fragments. In this way, the reader’s first encounter with
the text portends that she may never get the whole story, yet
encourages her onward.

In fact, as this semblance of narrative organization all but
disappears beyond the table of contents, it becomes increasingly clear
that the reader fully controls the order of nodes. After progressing
from the navigation page, the reader’s options multiply exponentially,
and these options compete for the reader’s selection. In order to
proceed through the text, the reader is forced to decide from the
abundance of choices. On this particular node, reached from the “I
want her” chapter title on the table of contents, hyperlinks run up
and down the left side of the screen and populate the main
text. Clicking through the first link in the main text, “Jennie,” the
reader reaches a node with nine links. Again, how does she choose to
proceed among these links? According to Barthes, the text of bliss
wants to be read: “the text you write must prove to me that it desires
me” (6). In deciding between the links that vie for her attention, the
reader may follow her own impulsivity (she may simply click on the
first link she sees, as she did on the previous page) or her interest
in the word being linked. The node tells a story about Jennie and
Tracey engaging in adolescent sexual exploits at summer camp. The
links on this page include “been to that campground,” “It's grade 10,”
“in my head I imagine a desperate love triangle,” “her hand under my
shirt,” “the s l o w movements of Jennie's fingers,” “a dyke -- I know
it -- but she won't do anything about it -- can't -- frozen,” “Close
the lights,” “We try not to move too much, too loudly,” and “attended
camp” (“Jennie only attended…”). At every node, the text proves again
and again that it desires her. The reader may decide to read through
this page, or read only a portion of the page, and interrupt her
progress to click on a link. Or the reader may forgo reading this page
altogether, and follow another link to a wholly new page. Either way,
she makes a decision in order to proceed, and her decision determines
the order of each node’s appearance. The text of bliss wants to be
read, and the reader must decide how. By assembling the node into a
specific order, the reader organizes the text of bliss according to
the unique path that she chooses.

one restore absence to itself? Put simply, can an empty archive also
be full?" (1). 

Hartmen's "critical fabulation"

The archivist must work within the discrepancy between reality and the
historical record. Hartman's goal is "to expose and exploit the
incommensurability between the experience of the enslaved and the
fictions of history... the requirements of narrative, the stuff of
subjects and plots and ends" ("Venus" 10).
- "This double gesture can be described as straining against the
  limits of the archive to write a cultural history of the captive,
  and, at the same time, enacting the impossibility of representing
  the lives of the captives precisely through the process of
  narration" ("Venus" 11).

Amber Musser's surface aesthetics: POC theorists have shown us how
subjectivity is never quite attainable.

Amber Musser's "surface aesthetics": Reading the "surface" to present

  - Writing on photographs of Billy Holiday. How these show a

    rather than interiority" (par. 11).
  - "we can understand surface as the underside of the
    scientific/pornographic drive toward locating knowledge in an
    “objective” image" (par. 2)

An image of Billy Holiday "shows us surface aesthetics in its emphasis
on shine" (par. 1).
  - "many of the elements that shine—--pearls, eye shadow, and
    lipstick--—decorate or cover Harris’s body. They alter its surface and
    also make a spectacle of these superficial alterations. Taken
    together these attributes emphasize the ways that surface hints at
    the pleasures of opacity" (par. 2)
  - "Shine also complicates matters because of the way that it is
    imbricated in representations of blackness...Shine distracts from
    the mandate of transparency and mobilizes hypervisibility—-the
    cover of surface—-so that interiorities remain opaque... so that
    blackness is spectacular, but not knowable" (par. 3).
  - "these versions of self-portraiture go beyond mere representation
    and mark *creative forms of expressivity that reveal forms of self
    that exceed capture*...The force of Billie #21, then, emerges in
    our recognition that the photograph is explicitly not revealing
    Harris’s interiority, but that it instead illuminates the
    possibility of reading Harris as a plural self both in relation to
    Holiday through his performance of citation and in relation to the
    otherness of himself that he summons" (par. 6)

*** TODO add Confessions on opacity

*** TODO revise invisibility is good, allows queers avoid being seen

As disidentified, queer subjects remain outside of the confines of the
visible. To gain visibility within the dominant system only reproduces
visibility within the terms of that system. This position has been
articulated by critiques of feminism since the 70s and 80s, and later
on, in critiques of LGBT+ equality movements. bell hooks explains that
one of the main issues with the women's movement of the 70s and 80s
was a lack of agreement about the goals of feminism. Feminists that
advocate for "equality with men," miss the point of radical change
altogether: "As long as... any group defines liberation as gaining
social equality with ruling class white men, they have a vested
interest in the continued exploitation and oppression of others"
(/Feminist Theory/ 15). By prioritizing equal rights, such as access
to employment, childcare, and social services, the women's movement
asks to be included in the existing system that is already oppressing
them. hooks is not saying that these aren't worthy or even necessary
causes, but that the changes enacted by such measures will not be
enough to raise the quality of life for oppressed and exploited
peoples. This in particular is harmful for black women, who, as women
of color, have the most to lose within the neoliberal ideology. hooks
asserts that "Feminism is a struggle to end sexist
oppression. Therefore, it is necessarily a struggle to eradicate the
ideology of domination that permeates Western culture on various
levels as well as a commitment to reorganizing society" (/Feminist
Theory/ 24). One of the major stakes in this chapter is to find ways
of subverting, resisting, or opting out of hegemonic understandings of
visibility as progress. This chapter will explore how being visible,
accessible, /touchable/ by the dominant power is being subjected to
the terms of that power. At that point, it will be clear that
queerness's status as untouchable works to enhance its political
potential.

*** TODO draft Toward a Queer Form
Writing the self is connected to form. Always. The form is
multiple. The form makes subjectivity opaque, but in the act of
abstraction, making it opaque, we can touch it and play around with
it. 

Opacity as value (Amin, Musser)

“For our purposes, queer form means challenging the primacy of the
visual, which has too often been a site for pernicious power
relations… At their base, such operations of surveillance and
classification rely on the concept of immutable difference, on sharp
boundaries, and on the possibility of exhaustively knowing the
other…. We see queer form as an aesthetics that moves persistently
around the visual, thereby avoiding this flattening. To the extent
that form operates behind the scenes as ideological impulse and
materiality, queer formal practices can resist the dictates of
transparency normally required of non-normative subjects by
illuminating the unseen. In this way it not only troubles the
epistemic assurances of the visual regime, but it also asks how
shifting away from static visuality can circumnavigate questions of
objectification. A move toward the diffusely sensual, and away from
the linearity of visual gazing, articulates difference in terms that
are not about dominance or norms, but that underscore the importance
of thinking with other modes of knowing, theorizing, and
experiencing. Queer form is about other ways of understanding
relationships to power and relationships to being” (Amin, Musser,
Perez 232-3)

Form understood as associated with queerness, queer experience, and as a way to disrupt easy understanding. Form can be queer and queer form can be opaque: 
“Form informs queerness, and queerness is best understood as a series of relations to form, relations not limited to binary and adversarial models of resistance and opposition” (228).
“Queer form” emerges… as a name for the range of formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies that make difference a little less knowable, visible, and digestible. This special issue makes a case for the value of indirection, opacity, and withholding as queer strategies for minoritarian art producers” (235).
 “form focuses attention on how violence—homophobia, racism, gentrification, capitalism, and colonialism, for instance—has structured conditions of possibility in material and epistemological ways” (232).

in that they abstract from the source

*** TODO draft Frontera on vitality

the book as living and structured
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In looking at this book that I’m almost finished writing, I see a
mosaic pattern (Aztec-like) emerging, a weaving pattern, thin here,
thick there. I see a preoccupation with the deep structure, the
underlying structure, with the gesso underpainting that is red earth,
black earth. I can see the deep structure, the scaffolding. If I can
get the bone structure right, then putting flesh on it proceeds
without too many hitches. The problem is that the bones often do not
exist prior to the flesh, but are shaped after a vague and broad
shadow of its form is discerned or uncovered during beginning, middle
and final stages of the writing. Numerous overlays of paint, rough
surfaces, smooth surfaces make me realize l am preoccupied with
texture as well. Too, I see the barely contained color threatening to
spill over the boundaries of the object it represents and into other
"objects" and over the borders of the frame. I see a hybridization of
metaphor, different species of ideas popping up here, popping up
there, full of variations and seeming contradictions, though I believe
in an ordered, structured universe where all phenomena are
interrelated and imbued with spirit. This almost finished product
seems an assemblage, a montage, a beaded work with several leitmotifs
and with a central core, now appearing, now disappearing in a crazy
dance. The whole thing has had a mind of its own, escaping me and
insisting on putting together the pieces of its own puzzle with
minimal direction hom my will. It is a rebellious, willful entity, a
precocious girl-child forced to grow up too quickly, rough,
unyielding, with pieces of feather sticking out here and there, fur,
twigs, clay. My child, but not for much longer. This female being is
angry, sad, joyful, is Coatlicue, dove, horse, serpent, cactus. Though
it is a flawed thing---a clumsy, complex, groping blind thing---for me
it is alive, infused with spirit. I talk to it; it talks to me. (66-67

*** TODO revise Underwood's models as object of study

As a mode of relationality, "Feeling Backward" not presume a full
connection between the critic and subject, keeping the subject at arms
length. It approaches queerness as something receding, even when the
critic is perpetually in pursuit. This relationship between critic and
textual subject evokes some of the attitudes that digital humaninists
take toward their data. In some queer theory and digital humanities
runs a similar hesistation not to overdetermine or overinterpret the
content of what we read. Critics such as Johanna Drucker and Ted
Underwood are careful to qualify the nature of data as constructed,
wrenched from the reality of lived experience, and necessarily reduced
to fit whatever environs required by analysis. Even if they are
careful about approaching data as constructed, however, they take
vastly different routes in handling the results of their analysis.

Ted Underwood and other literary critics doing Computational Literary
Studies (CLS) approach their data with vastly different
commitments. Underwood harnesses computational power and
sophistication to glimpse the big picture of literary history, what he
calls the "distant horizon" of literary trends across centuries. His
argument convincingly begins with the observation that human
capacities---sight, attention, and memory---preclude them from
grasping the larger patterns of literary history over time
periods. Distant reading, whereby "distance" implies abstraction, or
the simplification of textual data into computable objects such as
publication dates and genres, allows critics to make connections in
apparent chaos, to draw a steady line of historical development
through the swarm of overflowing information. According to Underwood,
distant reading opens new scopes to literary analysis, which would
otherwise be invisible to readers: "a single pair of eyes at ground
level can't grasp the curve of the horizon" (x).

Though to a much lesser degree than Drucker, Underwood similarly turns
his computational method into an object of study. His research deploys
machine learning, that is, computer programs "trained" by certain data
sets to make predictions about other datasets. Underwood studies how
"models," or calculations based on multiple variables, created by
sample data can then be used to measure further data. One of his
models measures the probability that computers can guess the sex of
a fictional character based on the words associated with that
character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on---excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. 115
#+END_QUOTE

The computer takes in information about some (the more the better)
books and studies that information in order to make predictions about
other books. The resulting model, therefore, is always guided by its
previous experience. Underwood rightly points out that such
calculations cannot be taken as fact. Like humans, "machine learning
tends to absorb assumptions latent in the evidence it is trained on"
(xv). To Underwood, machine learning is no more "objective" than
regualar analysis. This is why Underwood calls his work "perspectival
modeling," where he studies how datasets reveal, not the truth of
literary histroy, but the /approaches/ of those who study it: "By
training models on evidence selected by different people, we can
crystallize different social perspectives and compare them rigorously
to each other" (xv).

The results of the analysis is baked into the process, something that
Underwood understands and accepts as part of the obstacles toward his
distant horizon. In looking at the way gender is characterized, or
rather how perspectival models characterize gender, in novels from the
18th century to the 21st, he finds that the results reproduce some of
the structuring assumptions from the outset. His examination of gender
characterization finds that "while gender roles were becoming more
flexible, the attention actually devoted to women was declining"
(114). The analysis points to a steady overapping of words used to
describe men and women over time, shown as a convergence on the graph
between words previously associated with women, such as "heart," which
begin to intersect with words typically assoicated with men, like
"passion," toward the middle of the 20th century. However, while the
categories of "masculine" and "feminine" words are progressively
blurred over time, the actual number of female /characters/
declines. Underwood explains this drop could be due to several
reasons, one of which is the simple fact that the practice of writing
"gentrified" through the 20th century, when writing became
acknowledged and pursued as a male occupation (137). His analysis
shows that men tend to write more about men, while women write equally
about men and women. With less women writing, the amount of female
characters therefore declines. This explains how Underwood's seemingly
paradoxical conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while
the actual prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be
possible. But Underwood also admits that another factor---the
assumption of gender as a binary category---might very well be guiding
his results: "One possible conclusion would be that the structural
positions of masculine and feminine identity, vis-'a-vis each other,
have remained very stable---while the actual content of masculinity
and femninity has been entirely mutable" (140). Viewing gender as a
binary construction perpetuates the structural categories of
male/female in a way that is at odds with the actual content of such
categorie. In other words, if gender is binary, then it stands to
reason that the relation between male and female will be one of
opposition. Underwood proposes that one way around this confining
structure of binary gender would be to refigure gender "as a spectrum
or as a /multiplication/ of gender identities that made the binary
opposition between masculine and feminine increasingly irrelevant to
characters' plural roles" (140).

**** TODO add Mandell on gender as social construction
*** TODO revise nan Z da on reproducibility
The criterion of reproducibility is deployed as a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of digital quantitative
methods. Despite their vastly different committments and methods,
scholars like Underwood can be compared to Nan Z. Da, Sari Altschuler
and David Weimer for the ways they place value on reproducibility.

In a controversial peice about text analysis, Nan Z. Da critiques
Computational Literary Studies (CLS) for its irrelevance to literary
criticism. Da explains that results from quantification do one of two
things: they either affirm what is already obvious or they present
conclusions that are inaccurate. Of her many gripes with quantitative
methods, which include "technical problems, logical fallacies, and
conceptual flaws," her central concern is the fundamental "mismatch"
of scientific methods to humanistic inquiry, both of which have
opposing "natures" (601). Meant for reading in abundance, tradign
"speed for accuracy, and coverage for nuance," Quantitativ methods are
inappropriately applied to literary interpretation (620). According to
Da, "we must use them in accordance with their true functions” (620).

One point in Da's essay crystallizes her ultimately conservative
investment that aligns her with theorists who have vastly different
methods and perspectives. Here she establishes the criterion of
reproducibility, which suggests an objective at odds with humanistic
endeavor. To verify the results of a Topic Modelling experiment, Da
attempts to replicate the model on her own machine. Because the
reproduction fails, she denigrates the whole process: "if the method
were effective, someone with comparable training should be able to use
the same parameters to get basically the same results"
(628-629). However, "topic modeling is like a kaleidoscope that turns
out something entirely different with the slightest tweaking”
(629). Her emphasis on the “reproducible” in CLS extends one of
distant reading early champion's originating call for a “falsifiable
criticism”: both advocate for a methodology that is as reliable and
verifiable as the social sciences[fn:7]. The interesting detail in her
critique is the insinuation in /reproducible/ that somehow analysis is
something that can exist outside of human performance/activity/error.

The reproducible indicates a slippery slope. By characterizing
literary criticism as something that can be verified, that can be
copied and reproduced ad infinitum, it assumes that interpretive
conditions can be universalized, that subjects bring with them the
same experiences and investments. Moreover, it suggests that there is
a /correct/ answer to literary critical questions, as if literature is
a problem that needs to be solved.

*** TODO draft Altschuler and Weimar

This notion extends to digital humanist practitioners. 

they call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses" while maintaining that reproduction is
the highest value. They argue to "texture the humanities", pointing
out that much of DH prioritizes the visual over other senses --
"privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible"
(74). Rightly so, they argue, “The textured DH we call for here
acknowledges that we cannot study knowledge only abstractly, apart
from the senses, and that we cannot study literature, art, and history
without including the history of embodied experiences” (74-75).
- “Touch This Page! uses 3-D printed facsimiles of raised-letter text to inspire reflection on the assumptions most people make about which senses are involved in reading” (82).

But they stray too far when they place reproduction over
remediation/deformance. They state their aims: “to expand the sensory
accessibility of archives for all users and to do so through the
digital reproduction---rather than the translation---of tactile
knowledge” (76). Case example of the perfect reproduction:
- A scenario where “users... can download a visual copy with
descriptive data, engage with the text in virtual reality, and create
their own textured facsimile. This technology once more makes possible
the tactile reading experiences for which this volume was designed and
promises library patrons a richer engagement with touch than most
archives can currently provide---even in person (85-86). 

The use case scenario makes the assumption that a reproduction is the
ideal form of textuality, despite their asserted aims for "diversity
of embodied experiences":
- “we must avoid tilting after the fiction of some ideal digital surrogate---like a virtual reality system that would flawlessly mimic original objects---lest we become digital Pierre Menards, expending extensive energy to improve our reproductions to discover, at last, that only the original perfects represents itself… Instead, we envision in our tactile futures multiple strategies that could not only open up access to varied experiences---past and present---but also diversity the ways embodied experiences structure our digital worlds” (86).
- in order to open up “multiple strategies” and diversity embodied experiences, we need a theory of text that is capacious enough to accept variation and transmediation. 
- This argument overlooks deformance is a
solution: the ways that creating new texts, paratexts, creates new
objects of knowledge. It overlooks the performative, ala McGann,
Clement.

In this view, digital becomes a means of optimization, efficiency,
total knowledge and understanding.

*** TODO refine Drucker's skewing the graphs

Johanna Drucker argues that quantification techniques (such as
visualizations in graphs and charts) actually misrepresent the data
they are meant to convey. Drucker explains that, in order to place
this data on a graph or chart, it undergoes a
transformation. Complexity is reduced to whatever quality the
visualization apparently requires. To illustrate this reduction,
Drucker presents a chart displaying the amount of books published over
several years. The chart appears to convey production during this
specific time period[fn:5], but Drucker explains that publication date
is an arbitrary metric for capturing production. She brings to the
surface all the assumptions made in such a metric, for example, the
limitations of "novel" as a genre and the connotations behind
"published," which suggests date of appearance, but has no indication
of composition, editing, review, distribution. Drucker reminds us that
each piece of data carries with it the result of many interpretive
decisions, which carry with them varying degrees of opacity. These
interpretations ("reductions") are necessary in order to present
complex concepts like book production as a bar on a chart. Drucker
explains: "the graphical presentation of supposedly self-evident
information (again, formulated in this example as “the number of
novels published in a year”) conceals these complexities, and the
interpretative factors that bring the numerics into being, under a
guise of graphical legibility" (Drucker par. 23).

To resist the reductions of "data," a term that connotes that which is
"given," Drucker proposes "capta," to suggest the act of being taken
and transformed. Drucker's "capta" is deliberately creative, turning
graphical expressions into expressive metrics: components used for
measurement, like lines or bars on a graph, break or are fuzzy and
permeable. Objects are not discrete entities, but interact with the
other objects in the visualization. For example, in a bar graph of
book publications/year, she warps the bars on the graph, making some
of them fuzzy, wider, shorter, in an attempt to show that publication
as a metric elides other information such as composition, editing,
purchasing, etc.

This activity is a way of figuring elements that have been reduced,
resolved, or ignored in traditional quantitative analysis. It evokes
what Love says about queer subjectivity and experience being beyond
the reaches of the critic. Drucker makes evident what is overlooked or
assumed when dealing with complex subjects. She places those elements
there, for all to see, in a way that muddles (rather than
simplifies[fn:6]) the relationship between them. She does try to
figure these elements, but not in a way that attempts to clarify or
resolve their complexity. Rather, like Love, she works on the “image
of exile, of refusal, even of failure” (Love 71).
 

*** TODO add the intersection btw queer & digit
The "desire for touching," without being able to fully touch, as the
definition of queerness, is also where the digital and queer
intersect. Digital media creates the illusion that we have access to
data, to information, but all we have access to is a *formalized*
relationship to that data. We encounter the digital object through
mediation, through an interface, mice, GUIs, keyboards, etc.

These tools work alongside the reader’s intuition, in what Jerome
McGann calls a “prosthetic extension of that demand for critical

*** Critique of Underwood's "sensitivity"

Underwood overlooks the ways that distant reading can be a
prosthesis. Claims that Quantitative are not as "sensitive" or
"exacting" as close reading, and are mostly useful for long views. How
can we approach distant reading as multiplying alternative readings?
Rightly points out that human attention guides the scale of
analysis. So we have to be very careful at the question we are posing,
and the way that we interact with the computer.
    - "Critics who want to sensitively describe the merits of a single
      work usually have no need for statistics... Computational
      analysis of a text is more flexible than it used to be, but it
      is still quite crude compared to human reading; it helps mainly
      with questions where evidence is simple too big to fit in a
      single reader's memory" (xxi).
- Repeatedly stresses that the point of quantitative methods is to
  discover new scales of analysis, but he seems to be looking for an
  overarching theory that will encapsulate literary
  history. Quantitative methods seek to overcome a problem of
  attention, of memory, in order to gain a large view. Here, human
  memory is a hindrance, rather than a drive. The goal is rather to
  multiply alternative readings. 
    - Attention determines analysis, analysis determines knowledge,
      knowledge determines disciplines, periodization (8).
    - "The challenge is to find a perspective that makes the descriptions
      preferred by eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century
      scholars all congruent with each other" (32).

queerness manifests as an affective relation between the

study and the inchoate cluster of feelings that inhabit and animate
the term queer" (173).
*** Reading touching: within our bodies
This point bears repeating---we are always stuck within the bodies of
our thinking. As such, we might as well turn to ourselves, to explore
(rather than how things are in the world) how things are /to
us/. Sedgwick points out that the problem is not one of knowledge, but
one of movement. We can try to in-/corporate/, as much as possible,
alternative reading methods that get at the unique experience of being
a thinking/feeling human that is fiddling with these tools. We can, in
other words, examine the possibilities of /touching/ what we read. And
we can do so with digital tools for text analysis and machine
learning.  However, there still exists a view that distant reading
lacks the sensitivity of close reading. "Critics who want to
sensitively describe the merits of a single work usually have no need
for statistics" (xxi).

*** data reduction / queer assimilation 
For those that would argue that negative feelings are no longer
relevant in today's world, Heather Love responds that the advent of
assimilation, of popular acceptance, only creates more problems for a
group that has come into being as abject. /(the corrolary for digital
studies is the proliferation of data, of information, digitization)/
Queer assimilation and apparent rise in acceptance across popular
culture and mass media contradicts the reality of shame and stigma
that everyday queers experience, a contradiction that breeds ever more
shame: "Of course, same-sex desire is not as impossible as it used to
be; as a result, the survival of feelings such as shame, isolation,
and self-hatred into the post-Stonewall era is often the occasion for
further feelings of shame. The embarrassment of owning such feelings,
out of place as they are in a movement that takes pride as its
watchword, is acute" (4). What do we do with these residual feelings
of shame?

How should queer criticism orient itself? Love shows that critics face
a contradiction, brought on by the reality of negative feelings and
psychic costs of being queer in a homophobic society. The narrative
trajectory of queer progress runs counter to the residual pain of
being queer. Criticism is stuck in the middle of this ambivalence,
between affirming its pride and bemoaning its suffering: "We are not
sure if we should explore the link between homosexuality and loss, or
set about proving that it does not exist" (Love 3).

*** Critique of affirmation: Cvetkovitch 

Attempts to affirm negative queer experience can be harmful. Ann
Cvetkovitch's work on trauma studies provides an example of how this
tendency can create further misunderstanding about suffering. In her
book, /Archive of Feelings/, Cvetkovitch explores expressions of
trauma within the public sphere. She asks how individuals might
reclaim some of the most negative and traumatic feelings into
something positive and theraputic: "I want to place moments of extreme
trauma alongside moments of everyday emotional distress that are often
the only sign that trauma's effects are still being felt” (3). She
wrests trauma studies out of medical discourse and into public
culture---turning something that is traditionally private and
pathologized into something communitarian, an open, everyday "archive
of feelings."

Importantly, Cvetkovitch marshalls this reconfiguration of trauma to
expand what we consider the 'archive'. She also makes some incisive
points about the inability to fully portray suffering: "Because trauma
can be unspeakable and unrepresentable and because it is marked by
forgetting and dissociation, it often seems to leave behind no records
at all" (7). Cvetkovitch explores alternative methods of figuring
trauma, which are transformed when they enter the public sphere. She
cites examples from public performances like rock shows or
documentaries, in which the artists enact "moments of intense affect
that are transformative or revealing” (26). 

Although her focus on the affective and ephemeral dimension of
performance opens up conceptions of the archive, Cvetkovitch perhaps
goes too far when she suggests that these performances are redemptive
or in some way compensate for traumatic experience. She indicates that
such performances go so far as to alleviate psychological damage and
suffering: “Imaginative work that may bear an oblique relation to the
actual event of sexual abuse can ultimately be more ‘healing’ than an
explicit rendering of the event” (94). Trauma is a real medical
condition, with real consequences (death) for those who do not seek
treatment or downplay its life-threatening effects. Critics should be
careful in extending a definition of trauma that will end up hurting
those who are affected by it. We do not need to move trauma strictly
from the medical discourse in order to have a more communitarian,
open, and public relationship to it. There are other ways to confront
stigma which doesn’t attempt to redeem it, as Love explores with her
notion of “Feeling Backward.”

The step that Cvetkovitch takes with regard to trauma is interesting,
however, for what it suggests about the role of the critic in
analysis. The point isn't to find evidence of overcoming queer
suffering, but to examine the ways that queerness is figured in
abstraction. What does queerness look like, what can it do? 

*** Munoz's disidentification quotes

"We desire it but we desire it with a difference"
(/Disidentifications/ 15).

"Disidentification is about recycling and rethinking encoded
meaning. The process of disidentification scrambles and reconstructs
the encoded message of a cultural text in a fashion that both exposes
the encoded message's universalizing and exlusionary machinations and
recircuits its workings to account for, include, and empower minority
identities and identifications. Thus disidentification is a step
further than cracking open the code of the majority: it proceeds to
use this code as raw material for representing a disempowered politics
or positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by dominant
culture" (/Disidentifications/ 31).

"The chapters that make up this study attempt to chart the ways
in which identity is enacted by minority subjects who must work
with/resist the conditions of (im)possibility that dominant culture
generates. The cultural performers I am considering in this book must
negotiate between a fixed identity disposition and the socially
encoded roles that are available for such subjects"
(/Disidentifications/ 6).
