** /ABSTRACT/

This chapter explores how the quantitative analysis of gender in text
might leverage gender theory toward a new methodology. It explores an
experimental approach that deconstructs gender binaries by drawing
connections between computer programming and gender theory. First, it
delves into the python programming language, focusing on the principle
of iteration that drives cleaning and regularizing tasks, as well as
the transformation of words into numerical representations for
quantitative processing, with the goal of bringing out the iterative
quality of working with python code. It then moves to Judith Butler’s
concept of gender performativity, which posits how gender expression
might subvert traditional social structures through repeatedly
“performing” gender constraints in ways that deviate from the
norm. Taking this shared quality of iteration between python and
gender, it proposes a text analysis methodology that iterates through
distant and close reading. It then concludes by considering the
limitations of this method, which poses gender as a discursive
phenomenon, and its place within a larger trajectory of Gender Studies
since Butler's text inaugurating the field.
** intro

The novel /Orlando: A Biography/ (1928), by Virginia Woolf, famously
opens with an assertive gender designation followed by an immediate
qualification: “He-for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the
fashion of the time did something to disguise it—was in the act of
slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters” (11). When
performing quantitative text analysis on this text, a fictional
biography of a 16th-century English nobleman who undergoes a sex
change, the standard tasks of “pre-processing” text evacuate the ways
that gender is unsettled in this sentence. In order to computationally
analyze a text, a process known which involves calculating and
visualizing textual patterns, the text must first be transformed into
a computable format. This task of pre-processing (also called
“cleaning” or “normalizing”) strips the original text of capitalized
words, punctuation, “stop words” (such as articles and prepositions),
and inflections in word endings, all of which are deemed to be
semantically minor, in order to make the text amenable to quantitative
analysis. Afterward, the following list of computable words, or
“tokens,” remain in the first sentence:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
‘could’, ‘doubt’, ‘sex’, ‘though’, ‘fashion’, ‘time’, ‘something’,
‘disguise’, ‘act’, ‘slicing’, ‘head’, ‘moor’, ‘swung’, ‘rafter’.
#+END_QUOTE
Cleaning this text not only strips it of its pronouns, including the
gender assertion in the first word, “He.” It also cuts the em dash
immediately following this "He," which signals the entrance of a
narrator that layers this assertion with conspicuous certitude: "—for
there could be no doubt of his sex…."

This chapter examines how quantitative text analysis works with
gender, using Woolf's /Orlando/ as a test case. Text analysis borrows
from natural language processing methods to do analyses like topic
modelling and sentiment analysis and machine learning methods like
logistic regression and word embeddings (discussed below), which
involves counting, classifying, and predicting textual
patterns. Though these methods differ in important ways, they share a
faith in using the speed of computation, which can process very
precise elements like word frequency or syntactic patterns, to analyze
large collections of textual data.

** the fantasy of the falsifiable
Because computers can process hundreds of texts at a time, "reading"
at much faster rates than humans, they offer critics an opportunity
for solving the problem of literary scale. This opportunity attracts
literary critics like Franco Moretti, Matthew Jockers, Ted Underwood,
among others, who pose ambitious questions about literary
history. According to Moretti, the process of quantification involves
steps that reduce or abstract textual elements into computable form in
ways that open the potential for analysis: "fewer elements, hence a
sharper sense of their overall interconnection" (/Graphs/ 1). [fn:1]
Moretti, who is largely responsible for popularizing the practice of
"distant reading" in English Studies contexts, explores how social and
economic forces impacts literary form in the development of the modern
novel. While critiques of Moretti abound (not least the #metoo ones),
I want to focus here on an early moment in his career which reveals
his motivations for moving toward what I call "the fantasy of the
falsifiable." His purview extends to thousands of texts from about
1750 to the present day--a database that would otherwise be too large
and unweildy to analyze though non-digital means. According to
Moretti, the computer not only enables large-scale analysis but
creates a formal stucture for understanding texts, whereby "distance
... is not an obstacle, but a condition of knowledge" (/Distant
Reading/ 48).

Underlying this desire for analyzing literature at scale is another
desire to shore up the reliance on critical subjectivity in literary
analysis. Moretti's early essay, "The Soul and the Harpy" (1983), lays
out the reasoning behind developing a new methodological approach for
literary criticism, which will eventually flourish into "distant
reading." Moretti's positioning in this essay betrays a deep suspicion
about the indulgence of critical subjectivity in analysis, which he
casts as a concern about current methods of literary criticism, which
he calls "a sort of cultivated accompaniment to reading" (21). By
this, he means that the analytical practices of contemporary literary
critics, which "revolve around concepts such as ‘ambiguity’ and the
like" will "always be pushed into multiplying, rather than reducing,
the obstacles every social science encounters when it tries to give
itself a testable foundation" (22). Moretti offers a caricature of the
"student" of literature to illustrate his critique:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The [student]--unless desirous of turning into that legendary figure
whose only pleasure lay in contemplating his own reflection--must
concentrate on the dissimilarities and ruptures: on what has been lost
and become irretrievably unfamiliar, and which we can 're-familiarize'
only by doing such violence to it that we distort the objective,
material consistency of every work which it is the task of scientific
knowledge to reconstruct and 'salvage'. 14
#+END_QUOTE
According to Moretti, literary criticism encourages the critic's
narcissism. Moretti's alternative methodology borrows from the
sciences to maintains the "objective, material consistency" of the
work by minimizing the potential for difference and
disagreement. Grounding the critical process on a more solid
foundation, Moretti calls for a "falsifiable criticism" that can
"test" literary interpretations (21). /Falsifiable/ here means that it
must be contestable--one must be able to imagine an alternative to
ensure hypothesis can be meaningfully tested. Falsifiable criticism
pursues interpretations as "coherent, univocal, and complete," where
the "results" can be compared with "data" which "appear contradictory
or inexplicable in the light of the hypothesis itself" (21). Moretti
here envisions a literary criticism that would steadily progress
toward irrefutable knowledge: "The day criticism gives up the battle
cry ‘it is possible to interpret this element in the following way’,
to replace it with the much more prosaic ‘the following interpretation
is impossible for such and such a reason’, it will have taken a huge
step forward on the road of methodological solidity" (22).

As Moretti's falsifiable criticism eventually grows into "distant
reading," he streamlines his critical method into a recursive process
of posing hypotheses, collecting and assembling data, and making
inferences. The results are often unexpected, and sometimes bring
Moretti to reframe his hypotheses. This move relegates the literary
critic to the role of explaining results. For example, in “Style,
Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles (British Novels, 1740-1850),”
Moretti plots book titles on a series of graphs in order to explore
how market forces influence the size and content of the titles. He
finds that titles are quite sensitive to the market: "As the market
expands, titles contract; as they do that, they learn to compress
meaning; and as they do that, they develop special ‘signals’ to place
books in the right market niche” (204). Moretti's incisive
interpretation, which is borne by the various graphs of title lengths
over time, obscures the fact that it is, fundamentally, an
interpretation. A closer look at his language betrays the extent to
which he makes interpretative moves at every step:
#+begin_quote
in what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
/describe/ a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
/try to explain/ its causes; next, I /suggest/ how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I /make a little attempt/ at quantitative
stylistics, /examining/ some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
*** TODO add to Ramasy's critique? whats the point here? recursivity? 
Moretti’s word choices here diminish the subjective work of critical
analysis--he /describe[s]/, /suggest[s]/, /examin[es]/, etc. As
Stephen Ramsay points out, this language presents the literary
critic's work as an objective description of unproblematic reality, as
if his conclusions are supplementary to the graphs and other
visualizations. According to Ramsay, Moretti’s claims that his
insights are “independent of interpretation” suggest that “data is
presented to us…  not as something that is also in need of
interpretation” (/Reading Machines/ 5). The computer's ability to
quantify textual data emboldens Moretti toward making seemingly
objective claims about literary history, all the while diminishing his
role as in analysis.

The faith in the "falsifiable" gets its strongest expression in a
famous detraction of quantitative methods in literary studies by Nan
Z. Da. Da argues that quantitative methods, which trade "speed for
accuracy, and coverage for nuance," reveal a "fundamental mismatch
betwen the statistical tools that are used and the objects to which
they are applied," (620, 601). In her critique, which cites "technical
problems, logical fallacies," Da emphasizes the lack of /reproducible/
results--that one researcher's process can be reproduced by another
researcher with identical output (601). She demonstrates her point
with an experiment in Topic Modeling, which generates a number of
"topics" from a textual corpus and is often used to "speed-read"
massive datasets to get a sense of their content. Da attempts to
verify the results of a Topic Modeling experiment by replicating the
process on her own machine, a replication which fails. She concludes
that, "if the method were effective, someone with comparable training
should be able to use the same parameters to get basically the same
results" (628-629). As Ben Schmidt points out, however, Da in fact
uses different parameters and software to run her experiments, which
explains her results. His critique points out that Da, in taking down
the quantification for literary studies, reinforces its role in
positivist inquiry:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Rather than pooh-pooh statistical reasoning, she elevates it by
incanting the language of quantification against itself. Far /more/
than anyone I’ve seen in any humanities article, she asserts that
scientists do something arcane, powerful, and true. [fn:2] 
#+END_QUOTE
*** TODO reinforce/reframe w/r/t/ reproducibility
Despite their vastly different committments and conclusions, Da and
Moretti align on the value that they place in the objective capacieis
of computational analysis. For both scholars, there is a implicit
faith that the computer can do some of the analytical work that has
been traditionally ascribed to the human.

Unlike Moretti and Da, Ted Underwood demonstrates a working awareness
with computational bias. Underwood's project uses machine learning
methods, in which a sample of data is used to make predictions about
larger groups of data, to visualize the "distant horizon" of literary
trends across centuries. One of his projects concerns studying how
gender markers in novels change over time, using a process he calls
"perspectival modelling." Underwood explains that "Machine learning
algorithms are actually bad at being objective and rather good at
absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence used to train
them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective" 92). According to Dan
Sinykin, this method allows Underwood "to leverag[e] the human
prejudices built into modeling toward humanistic ends" (par. 4). For
example, in his study of gender, Underwood uses a model that predicts
the the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated
with that character. Underwood explains the process of training the
predictive program:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on--excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. /Distant Horizons/ 115
#+END_QUOTE
This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles in
novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (/Distant Horizons/ 114). One of the many
explanations for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice
of writing becomes more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the
middle of the 20th century than it was previously (/Distant Horizons/
137). This fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about
men than women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline
in female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly
paradoxical conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while
the actual prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be
possible.

Underwood's methodology, however reinscribes the binary that he
attempts to deconstruct. This becomes most clear in his study that
measures the "gendering of words used in characterization" ("Machine
Learning and Human Perspective" 95). Here, Underwood uses uses
logistic regression analysis, which is an algorithm specifically
designed to study binary values, to see whether words align with
masculine or feminine characters. This algorithm, which is an
entry-level machine learning method, is designed for making
predictions on a scale of probability, from 1 to 0, for example,
between yes/no, pass/fail, win/lose, etc. In Underwood's case, the
probability is male/female, so the output necessarily reifies this
binary structure of gender. For this project, Underwood admits that he
needs a "simple" model in order to bring into relation the dynamics of
gender (See Fig. 2). He admits that "gender theorists will be
frustrated by the binary structure of the diagram" which "reduce[s]
the complex reality of gender identification to two public roles: men
and women" ("Machine Learning" 98). In aiming for simplicity,
Underwood indicates that his initial assumptions will affect the final
result. 

[[./img/Underwood.png]] Caption: Underwood's logistic regression model. The
verticle axis visualizes the representation of words by women, and the
horizontal by men, with positive numbers signifying overrepresentation
of these terms. So terms on the top right are words that are used
often by men and women writers, and terms in the upper left and lower
right are ones used most often by women and men, respectively.

Collapsing of gender into a single graph might bring to the surface
the various "perspectives" on gender markers across time, but it does
so within a larger reification of the categories of male and
female. Underwood himself admits the possibility that he finds a
structural tension between gender "because [he] explores gender, for
the most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant Horizons/
140). Asking a machine to compute the conscription of gender as male
or female for the purpose of seeing how male and female roles in
novels change over time only /reproduces/ a model of gender that is
"simple" enough to be computed.

Without a doubt, reproducing conceptions of gender is useful for
historicizing gender identities and ideologies over time. In my view,
however, these approaches fail to harness the potential of both
computation and gender. Regardless of the methodology, it seems that
the goal of establishing some kind of knowledge about literary
history, whether that be a "distant horizon," or "the great unread,"
side-steps some of the more novel and novel insightful processes a
computer might undertake. Distant reading methods might, for example,
harness what Stephen Ramsay calls "the objectivity of the machine," to
destabilize the binary, readings that are inescapably partial and
speculative(x). Drawing from the deformative critical methods of
Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels, Ramsay proposes that researchers
harness the enabling constraints of computation to "unleash the
potentialities" of the text, offering opportunities for new readings
(33).

Resisting the temptations of falsifiable criticism, work by critics
like Susan Brown and Laura Mandell apply distant reading methods
toward deconstructing the historical concepts of gender. In their
introduction to /The Journal for Cultural Analytics/'s "Identity
Issue," Brown and Mandell situate feminist debates around identity
politics as a necessary context for understanding how computational
processes engage gender identity. They explain that, "The goal is to
acknowledge the subjective effects of belonging to an identity
constituted historically through oppression without believing that the
identity itself exists independently from historical conditions"
(Mandell and Brown 6). In other words, because identity labels are
historically constructed, the computer can be used to study this
construction as a historical phenomena. Crucially, this position
places computational methods within a discursive frame, aligning it
with debates from post-structuralist feminist theory that explore and
provoke the representative capacities of language. The computer can
become a tool, not for verifying/reifying what we know, but for
exploring how language constructs (and can deconstruct) categories.

Laura Mandell, for example, uses distant reading to deconstruct what
she calls the "M/F binary," which is the reduction of gender into
data. In her critique of Matthew Jockers and Jan Rybicki, Mandell
demonstrates that the M/F binary reifies stereotypes in their
premises, by "presenting conclusions about 'male' and 'female' modes
of thinking and writing as if the M/F terms were simple pointers to an
unproblematic reality, transparently referential and not discursively
constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's examination marshalls key findings
from feminist theory, drawing from Judith Butler, among others, to
assert that gender is a socially constituted category which is
"constructed both by the measurer and the measured" (par. 38).

To deconstruct gender, Mandell turns to genre, another category which
will allow scholars to see the reductive constitution of categories
generally. To study genre, Mandell uses the popular stylometry
measurement, "Burrow's Delta," which visualizes the "distance" between
writing styles by creating branches (or "deltas") between different
texts. Her experiment finds that the stylistic qualities of a female
writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, shares with those of male writers:
"Wollstonecraft’s sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble
[William] Godwin’s sentimental anti-Jacobin novels... whereas her
essays most resemble [Samuel] Johnson’s writings" (par. 29). Just as
quantification can deconstruct what So and Roland describe as "the
machine's initial binary understanding of white and black," so it can
deflate the M/F binary (So and Roland 68). Moving beyond
deconstruction, however, Mandell encourages rearchers "to experiment
with new taxonomies of gender," creating new categories that reflect
gender as a multiplicity (par. 37). Mandell emphasizes the potential
for complex data models to "break the strength of the signal" by
creating categories such as "'men writing as men,' 'women writing as
women,' 'women writing as men,' 'men writing as women,' 'unspecified
(anonymous) writing as men,'" and so on (par. 35). She points out that
the computer allows researchers to "animate numerical processes rather
than fixing their results as stereotype" (par. 7). It offers, in
Mandell's words, "parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very
complex reality” (par. 38).

Deconstructing binaries also works with race. Edwin Roland and Richard
study explore the constructedness of racial categories by
experimenting with an algorithm that evaluates whether an author is
white or black based on diction. Analyzing a large corpora of novels
by white and black authors, they find that, black authors generally
display more varied vocabulary than white authors (66). From this they
infer that white authorship, as a category, only coheres against the
variance of black authorship. Whiteness, in other words, /depends/ on
the characterization of blackness.[fn:3]

This quantitative exercise, rather than draw So and Roland toward
making general conclusions about race and authorship, points them
toward a peculiarity in the results: that the algorithm wrongly
categorizes James Baldwin's novel /Giovanni's Room/ (1956) as being
written by a white author. Apparently, the computer reads Baldwin's
use of the term "appalled" as proof of white authorsip. Going back to
examine this word in the text, So and Roland discover that this term
occurs only once, in the early scene where David (the narrator)
describes his strained relationship to his father: "I did not want to
be his buddy. I wanted to be his son. What passed between us as
masculine candor exhausted and /appalled/ me" (my emphasis; Rpt. in So
and Roland 71). Noting the connotations of whiteness in "appalled,"
which has the middle French root, "apalir," meaning "to grow pale," So
and Roland insightfully conclude that this term indexes an
intersection of gender with race: "the moment David develops a
troubled relationship to normative masculinity [as] also the moment he
becomes 'white'" (71). The computer's misclassification, as they point
out, reinforces this text's notorious elision of explicit references
to race, whereby racial markers are displaced in favor of an implicit
whiteness, as critics have observed in the scholarship on this
novel. Taking the computer's mistake as a starting point, So and
Roland's analysis thus contributes to the ongoing debate about the
complex relationship between race and sexuality in the novel.

Here, in direct opposition to the "falsifiable" position,
computational error becomes a starting point for analysis. Because
race is a social construct, and machines only impute meaning that is
encoded into them, So and Roland reason that machines are be ideal
instruments for studying the construction of race (60). In particular,
the machine errors surface a yet unexplored fulcrum around which the
binary of race turns: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Our reading’s destabilization of the machine’s logic of white and
black arises directly from the novel’s expression of queerness. By
queering the machine’s color line, Baldwin’s novel challenges our
initial classifications of the novels as white or black, which had
necessarily effaced a more sophisticated, intersectional view of
social identity. In their current form, our data and model are not
robust enough to handle this kind of intersectionality. 72
#+END_QUOTE
In this case, a single computational error opens a site for more
daring leaps of speculation about how whiteness gestures toward a
troubled understanding of sexuality. So and Roland find that queerness
here operates as an articulation (both structurally and semantically)
of race. In the next section, I lay the groundwork for computationally
analyzing queerness by turning to the inaugural moment in Queer
Theory, gender performativity.

** iteration
*** Gender Performativity

So, Roland, Mandell and Brown demonstrate how computation can be
reworked toward deconstructing social categories. Mandell's work, in
particular, opens up the consideration of how gender theory, Judith
Butler's theory of gender performativity, might influence
computational analysis.

She points out that both gender and genre "are... highly imitable"
(par. 30), asserting that "Anyone can adopt gendered modes of
behavior, just as anyone can write in genres stereotypically labeled
M/F" (par.30). While this reading of Butler echoes a common assumption
about performativity, which Butler has been careful to clarify in her
writings since /Gender Trouble/, it also perceives a generative
alignment between gender and computation. In what follows, I explore
this alignment between gender and computation, which evoke
similarities that are productive for text analysis. As Mandell points
out, "Computation enables complexity" (par. 36), and gender, like
computation, contains rules and protocols that build toward higher
levels of complexity.

In her groundbreaking book, /Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity/ (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts
essentialist views of sex and gender in contemporary feminist thought:
first, that sex is biological while gender is constructed; and second,
the gender, as a construction, is a self-expression of the
subject. Because sex and gender are both constructions that exist
prior to identity. In fact, according to Butler, there is no such
thing as a subject that exists prior to gender expression, as a
subject only comes into being by participating in a gender norm. Here
emerges the common misreading of performativity, that performativity
denotes an act or series of acts that can be imitated at will, to be
put on and off like clothing. As Butler emphasizes in her later work,
performativity is compulsory and habitual, a process that /precedes/
and /constitutes/ the subject. Gender is a mechanism that allows the
subject to emerge: "construction is neither a subject nor its act, but
a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and 'acts' come to
appear at all" (/Bodies/ xviii). This process of /reiteration/ is
fully delineated in her follow up book, /Bodies That Matter/ (1995),
where she gives it the term "performative citation." Here, Butler
argues that what is experienced as the physical body, its boundaries
and its sexuality, only materialize through the repetition, the
"citation," of gender norms, whereby each act signals an authorizing
norm.

As I will demonstrate, Butler's theory of gender performativity has a
lot to lend to the study of computational text analysis. Before moving
to the details of this theory, however, it is important to understand
what such a theory can and cannot do. For example, common critiques of
Butler point out the limits of this theory for working with discursive
notions of gender and sexuality.[fn:4] Jay Prosser, coming from the
field of Trans Studies, problematizes Butler's "deliteralization of
sex," a critique that he applies to Queer Studies more
generally. Prosser explains that because Butler's analysis attends to
performativity as a discursive phenomenon, it elides the real-world
concerns of the body's materiality. Prosser offers the example of
Butler's reading of /Paris Is Burning/'s Venus Xtravaganza who, Butler
argues, occupies a space of transgression due to her inability to
attain her sex change. According to Butler, a sex change that would
"make [her]self complete" would also fulfill the desire for a
masculine body would reinscribe heterosexual hegemony (45). Prosser
points out that this reading fails to reckon with the material body
and its real and precarious existence, as Venus's death illustrates
(55). Here, Butler's "metaphorization of the transgender body"
demonstrates one crucial way that Queer Theory has subsumed, without
fully accounting for, transgressive desires in cross-gendered
identifications. This thread of critique is picked up in the
conclusion, where it instigates the next move within a larger
trajectory of Queer Studies presented in this dissertation.

To understand the constraints of performativity as a discursive
phenomenon, it is helpful to situate Butler's work within the context
of second-wave feminism and its post-structural approach toward gender
binaries. Here, Butler draws from the work of feminist theorist Luce
Irigaray, whose critique of gender undermines what Jacques Derrida's
defines as "phallogocentrism," the idea that man, symbolized by the
phallus, is the center and focus of knowledge. Irigaray asserts that
influential Western thinkers, like Plato, Aristotle, and Freud, for
example, have defined women and feminity "on the basis of masculine
parameters" (Irigaray, /The Sex Which Is Not One/ 23). The resulting
binaries that associate "woman" with "matter" (such as
"rationality/emotion" and "mind/body"), and set it subordinate to male
"form," effectively erase the possibility of representing woman at
all. Rather, the binary actually "/produces/ the feminine as that
which must be excluded for that [gender] economy to operate" (10; my
emphasis). The produced "domesticated" feminine term contrasts the
excessive feminine which cannot be expressed within the terms of the
binary (13). This "necessary outside" of the excluded feminine, which
is in fact is the enabling condition of the binary in the first place,
creates a "field of disruptive possibilities" (13). However, this
"unspeakable" element cannot be invoked directly, "through the figures
that philosophy provides," without subscribing itself to the ruling
structure (12). Butler illustrates this quandry with a hypothetical:
"how can one read a text for what does /not/ appear within its own
terms, but which nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of
its own legibility?" (11). For Butler, this question--how to express
what is not there, what is refused by the system of the visible--will
guide her theorization of gender subversion, what she calls
resignification, through performativity.

The process of resignification begins by positing a body that exists
prior to signification, that is, a body that has not yet been imbued
with meaning through language. Butler wonders, "Can language simply
refer to materiality, or is language also the very condition under
which materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Butler finds that, in
order to refer to a body, language must first assume a
body. Therefore, she reasons, the signification of the body actually
creates the body which it appears to reference: "This signification
produces as an /effect/ of its own procedure the very body that it
nevertheless and simultaneously claims to discover as that which
/precedes/ its own action" (emphasis original; 6). Butler explains
that "the mimetic or representational status of language.... is not
mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one
might even argue performative" (6). This point, that language produces
the reality that it claims to merely reference, has two crucial
ramifications: first, that subjects are always interpellated, and in
fact brought into subjectivity, by a discourse prior to their their
participation in it; and second, that this productive power of
language nonetheless offers a way out of the significatory circle.

For, amid this regulatory structure lies the possibility of what
Butler describes as /resignifying/ meaning. Because language
transcends a merely representative function, because it works to
/produce/ meaning, language can be resignified toward subversive
usages by "citing" what Bulter calls the "repudiated" meaning implied
by signification. Butler offers a rather famous example in the
resignification of the term "queer," which has been transformed from a
term of abjection to one of empowerment. "Queer" achieves this
resignification by harnessing its own repudiation, which is an implied
but "disavowed abjection [that] will threaten to expose the
self-grounding presumptions of the sexed subject" (3). In other words,
each time the term "queer" is used, it draws from that abjection which
is repudiated in every identification with heterosexuality. Butler
proposes that one "cite" this repudiation as a resource for
resignification: "to consider this threat and disruption... as a
critical resource in the struggle to articulate the very terms of
symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility" (3). Here, the concept
"citation" indicates an act of signification that draws from the
authorizing power. By citing the repudiated meaning, the term "queer"
"resignifyi[es] the abjection of homosexuality into defiance and
legitimacy" (xxviii). The resignification works because this
"performative citation" takes on the repudiation as its signification.

Because language is productive, it also offers a possibility of
resistance from within the signification system. Butler illustrates
how Irigaray achieves this resistance by performing the
phallogocentric language of the thinkers that she criticizes: "she
mimes philosophy... and, in the mime, takes on a language that
effectively cannot belong to her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use
performative citation as a strategy of undermining his authority
through repetition: "She cites Plato again and again, but the
citations expose precisely what is excluded from them, and seek to
show and to reintroduce the excluded into the system itself"
(18). Through repetition, Irigaray displaces the logic of
phallogocentrism, introducing something external to the system while
remaining within its terminology. Narrating what Butler imagines to be
Irigaray's thought process in an invigorating monologue, she lays out
the process of resistance:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you

#+END_QUOTE
In this description of resistance within the cycle of signification,
where deception emerges from resemblance and insubordiation through
subservience, the key is repetition. Resistance looks like repetition,
a continual activity, the miming of the authorizing norm, which
displaces it by introducing what is outside the logic of
phallogocentrism.

*** Python, NLTK, and Word Embeddings

Now that we have a sense of gender peformativity, we turn to Python to
get a closer look at how its syntax might evoke the process of
iteration.

To do common text analysis tasks, where text passed through an
automated seive to find patterns, many distant reading projects use
the Python programming language, which offers a number of custom
"libraries," or collections of code for specific tasks, such as
analyzing textual data. The most popular text analysis library in
python is the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), which contains useful
computational "methods" and "functions" that count, categorize, and
visualize textual patterns. 

As illustrated in the opening example in this chapter, the process of
preparing a text for text analyis always requires a reduction of data
in which some semantic value has escaped. In this example, "cleaning"
the first sentence of Woolf's novel, /Orlando/, strips it of its
pronouns and punctuation which has the effect of surpressing the
gender qualification: "He–for there could be no doubt of his sex,
though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it—-was in
the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters"
(11). After processing, the following words remain:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
‘could’, ‘doubt’, ‘sex’, ‘though’, ‘fashion’, ‘time’, ‘something’, ‘disguise’, ‘act’, ‘slicing’, ‘head’, ‘moor’, ‘swung’, ‘rafter’. 
#+END_SOURCE

For analyzing text, Python works with data in the form of words, or
~strings~, contained within groupings called ~lists~. Then, Python
/iterates/ through the list, that is, it performs a similar task to
each item in the list. For this purpose, an expression called the ~for
loop~ consists of six words over two lines which instruct Python to do
something to each item in the list, in other words, to "loop" through
data, carrying out some specified action to each peice. The first line
of the loop (~for word in sentence:~) specifies each word in the list,
and the second line (~print(word)~) instructs the computer to display
each word in the sentence. Essentially, this loop will go through each
item in the data, in this case, each word saved in the list
~sentence~, and it will ~print~ or display that data.[fn:5] The the
output will appear thus:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
sentence = ['He', '--', 'for', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'no', 'doubt',
'of', 'his', 'sex', ',', 'though', 'the', 'fashion', 'of', 'the',
'time','did', 'something', 'to', 'disguise', 'it', '--', 'was', 'in',
'the', 'act', 'of', 'slicing', 'at', 'the', 'head', 'of', 'a',
'Moor','which', 'swung', 'from', 'the', 'rafters']

for word in first_sentence:
    print(word)

['He',
 '--',
 'for',
 'there',
 'could',
 'be',
 'no',
 'doubt',
 'of',
 'his',
 'sex',
 ',',
 'though',
 'the',
 'fashion',
 'of',
 'the',
 'time',
 'did',
 'something',
 'to',
 'disguise',
 'it',
 '--',
 'was',
 'in',
 'the',
 'act',
 'of',
 'slicing',
 'at',
 'the',
 'head',
 'of',
 'a',
 'Moor',
 'which',
 'swung',
 'from',
 'the',
 'rafters']
#+END_SOURCE

These kinds of iterative computations, which are central to
programming tasks, are a core component of working with text. At a
very basic level, much of text analysis consists of iterating over
bits of text and doing something to each bit. In preprocessing, the
main tasks include tokenizing, cleaning, and regularizing the text,
which helps to eliminate pieces of text that will skew or slow results
of analysis due to their high frequency and low semantic
value. Tokenizing the text means separating the text into workable
units, or ~tokens~, that are easier to clean and regularize. Once the
text is tokenized, it can be stripped of capital letters, punctuation,
and what are called "stop words," which consist of prepositions,
articles, and related terms, such as "he," "for," "there," "be," "of,"
"the," and "did" in the above example. The following code block loops
through the text to remove punctuation and capital letters: 

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
normalized = []
for word in full_text:
    if word.isalpha():
        normalized.append(word.lower())
#+END_SOURCE

Before moving forward, there are two aspects about the cleaning and
regularizing process that merit some attention: the first is
recursion. The cleaning and regularizing process is highly recursive,
doing the same action to each item to the list of words that make up
the text. The logic of the code reinforces this recursiveness,
especially in the loop which iterates through items in a list, doing
the same thing to each item, one by one. Additionally, the code's
nested expressions reinforce recursion, as each line specifies another
action to be performed on each word. For example, in the following
code block, the first line isolates a word from the list, the second
line checks if that word contains only alphabetic characters, and the
third transforms that word to lowercase. Each of the three lines
performs an additional task on the same word.

The second notable aspect about the cleaning and regularizing process
is reduction. These tasks of preprosessing text force words into
existing boxes, so to speak, in order to make them amenable to
analysis. The effect of this preprocessing therefore strips text of
some of its semantic meaning, which can be contained in capitalized
words, rhythms of language in stop words, inflections in word endings,
and so on. This is not to say that preprocessing ought to be avoided,
but that the researcher should be aware of how certain textual
reductions have the potential to affect meaning.

Here, it begins by creating an empty list, ~normalized~, where
words will be dropped after filtering through them. The next line
begins the ~for loop~, which iterates through each word in the
~full_text~ list of words. The third line, an ~if statement~ creates
the condition specifying alphabetic characters (containing no numbers
or punctuation), and if the word fulfills that condition, then it
passes to the fourth line, which will add that word to the
~normalized~ list. At the moment that this word is added to the
list, its letters will be transformed to lowercase format. The final
list, therefore, will contain words that are all lowercase and contain
no punctuation.

The next step involves removing stop words, then
stemming/lemmatizing. For this process, the ~for loop~ can be
compressed into a ~list comprehension~:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
no_stops = [word for word in normalized if word not in stops]
#+END_SOURCE

This expression takes each word in a list, in this case, ~normalized~,
and checks to see if that word is also contained within the list of
stop words in ~stops~. If the word is /not/ a stop word, then it will
be added to a new list, ~no_stops~. Once this filtering is done, the
final list contains all lowercase words without punctuation or stop
words. For example:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
['could', 'doubt', 'sex', 'though', 'fashion', 'time', 'something',
'disguise', 'act', 'slicing','head', 'moor', 'swung', 'rafters']
#+END_SOURCE

After cleaning the text in this way, the next step involves stripping
the grammatical structure to get the word root. One of these
processes, called "stemming", involves cutting off the endings from
the word. For example, "rafters" will be stripped to "rafter." In
another process, called "lemmatizing," the computer will look up each
word, one by one, find its appropriate root, and then revert to that
root.

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python
clean = [WordNetLemmatizer.lemmatize(word, word) for word in no_stops]
#+END_SOURCE

At this point, the text is ready for analysis. The NLTK library comes
packaged with a series of "exploratory" methods that offer quick
analyses of textual patterns. At the base of many of these analyses
are word frequencies based on the context surrounding a given
word. For example, ~concordance()~ method returns the context, that
is, the immediate words surrounding the word "woman" from the text of
/Orlando/:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE

#+END_SOURCE

Building from the same concept as the ~concordance()~ method, another
method, called ~similar()~ calculates words which are used in similar
contexts as the target word. To compute the results of ~similar()~,
NLTK first takes the context of the term from ~concordance()~, then it
searches the text for other terms that contain similar contexts. The
result for running ~similar~ on the word "woman" is the following:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
man moment night boy word world child pen ship door one room window
light little lady table book queen king
#+END_SOURCE

By searching the text for words that appear /similarly/ to the chosen
word, this method reveals words that function in semantically similar
ways across the text. It is important to point out, however, that the
text itself does not impute meaning to the words. Rather, it can only
count words as "strings," that is, bits of data composed of the same
characters. It takes the string "woman," takes notes of all of the
strings in proximity to "woman," and then searches the rest of the
text for /other/ strings that have similar proximities. This method is
based on counting frequencies of characters that occur near each
other. 

This method, which is a basic natural language processing task,
contrasts with algorithmic and "deep learning" methods that work in
more sophisticated ways to count and analyze language. Many of these
methods use the concept of "word embeddings" to ascribe
machine-interpretable meaning to words. Like ~similar()~ and
~concordance()~, word embeddings build off patterns of word similarity
based on context. Unlike the NLTK methods, however, word embeddings
impute meaning to the contexts surrounding a given word. The meaning
of any given word is a numerical representation, actually a list of
numbers, in the form of a matrix. The classic example for introducing
the power of word embedding methods is the formula, "King - Man +
Woman = Queen" (Mikolev et al. 2). Here, gender is isolated as a
computable component which enables the formula to derive the
difference between "King" and "Queen".

In more technical terms, each word, such as "woman," is assigned a
vector representation in n-dimensional space, where each dimension
represents the similarity between woman and another word. For example,
according to one language model, the word "woman," is calculated
according to its similarity (or "weight") to other words, such as
"mother" and "father." Here, the word "woman" is more closely
associated with "mother," with its weight being .92, or 92%, then
"father," which has a weight of .90, or 90%. In simpler terms, any
given word is calculated according to its similarity to other
words. And the similarity, in turn, is calculated by context. For
example, below is a list of words from a popular language model
calculated as similar to "woman":[fn:6]

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
[('child', 0.9371739625930786),
 ('mother', 0.9214696884155273),

 ('guy', 0.9026350975036621),
 ('known', 0.8997253179550171)]
#+END_SOURCE

A word embedding for "woman," therefore, would contain a list of
numbers representing the similarity of other words to it, organized
within a tabular format. The word embedding would resemble the
following matrix:

| Target Word | child | mother | whose | called | person | wife |... |
|-------+-----+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+------+--- |
| Woman       | .937  | .921   | .917  | .915   |.914    |.909  |... |


Given this tabular representation, numerous mathematical operations
are possible using principles from statistics, linear algebra, and
calculus, which is the realm of "shallow learning" methods. Within the
more elusive realm of "deep learning" methods, like neural networks,
the labels of the numerical representations do not matter. Rather, the
only thing that matters is the list of numbers themeslves, which
together, form a vector to represent the word. The word "woman,"
therefore, would be represented with the following vector: .937. .921,
.917, .915, .914, .909, and so on. Deep learning methods demonstrate
that, even when removing semantic labels, /words are assigned meaning
by their relation to other words/. Even with each of these words
represented as a vector with the labels removed, the sexism of the
formula remains obvious: the woman is computed according to her
relation to a man.

** queer distant reading
*** Woolf's /Orlando/
I now turn to looking at gender in Virginia Woolf's novel, /Orlando: A
Biography/. This novel is ideal for a computational study of gender
for two reasons: first, it is perhaps the most salient example of
transgender narrative in the modernist era, and second, because this
narrative traces a crisis of signification of which gender is only one
expression. As various critics have noted, /Orlando/ deploys a
characterisitic modernist experimentation with limits of language
toward destabilizing gender norms.[fn:7] In what follows, I pursue an
/iterative/ text analysis of this text that interweave distant and
close readings based on the word embeddings of the gender markers,
"woman," and "man."

First, I begin with a list of terms computed similar to woman and man,
respectively, in the text. To get these results, I trained a language
model on the entire text of /Orlando/, so that the word contexts would
be based on how words are used in this specific text. Unlike the word
embeddings from my previous section, which were trained on Twitter
data, the results here therefore reflect an understanding of gender
which is specific to Woolf's novel.

The following are words associated with "woman":

#+BEGIN_SOURCE python

And the following are words associated with "man":

#+END_SOURCE

At first glance, the lists reflect commonly used words, and appear
somewhat similar, sharing terms like "would," "orlando," "night," and
"way." To get more specific results, I modified the code to remove
any words with strong associations to the opposite gender. The results
revealed more distinctive words associated with each gender:

#+END_SOURCE

This list of results contains words more uniquely associated with each
gender. The top terms for each list might align with existing
conceptions of femininity and masculinity, such as "soft" for "woman,"
and "chequered" for "man."  The rest of the terms also appear to
uphold a binary understanding of gender, with words like "frilled,"
"delicious," and "seductiveness," associated with "woman," and "fact,"
"defend," and "denounced" associated with "man." 

Beyond these general patterns, however, the results complicate an easy
understanding of gender as binary. Rather, they suggest that gender is
one expression for a larger crisis of signification in the novel. In
what follows, I use some of these words as starting points for
close-reading analysis of the text. I begin with unique words from
both lists which, appearing only once in the text, carry significant
semantic weight in their relation to gender. Then, I examine words
that co-occur in certain passages of the texts--moments which are
provocatively indicative of the relationship between gender and
language in the text.  

# Finally, to further probe some of the more distinctive usages of
# these terms, I return to distant reading, adapting the input terms
# to reflect more precise conceptions for gender in the novel.

Interestingly, while the top term for the "woman" category, "soft," is
used 9 times throughout the text, the top term for the "man" category,
"chequered" is only used once, at the very beginning of the story,
when the narrator describes Orlando stepping into "the yellow pools
chequered by the floor" (Woolf 12). This moment, as Orlando literally
steps into the spotlight of the story, is the first of many in which
the narrator casts doubt his credibility as a biographer, introducing
a crisis of signification that will plague his narration. Soon after
Orlando makes his appearance, the narrator distinguishes his role as a
biographer from that of the poet, who works to embellish and
exagerrate through figurative language. However, the narrator's
committment to straightforward description soon unravels when he
attempts to describe Orlando's beauty. Here, the language swells to
full-fledged figuration:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit
that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed
to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling
of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were
his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we
rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit
a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer
to ignore. 12-13
#+END_QUOTE
Here, the narrator's evocative language undermines the pretense to
objectivity which he feels compelled to produce. This doubt, which I
call the crisis of signification, reoccurs persistently throught the
novel. That the usage of "chequered," a uniquely "masculine" term in
the story, occurs in this passage, suggests that gender may play a
central role in this crisis.

The crisis of signification on the part of the narrator also occurs
within Orlando's experience itself. To reinforce this point, I take a
from the "woman" list, "despaired" which, like "chequered," occurs
only once in the novel. It appears at a point when Orlando, deep in a
depression following his desertion by Sasha, the Russian princess,
struggles to peice together his beliefs on truth and language:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Another metaphor by Jupiter!' he would exclaim as he said this (which
will show the disorderly and circuitous way in which his mind worked
and explain why the oak tree flowered and faded so often before he
came to any conclusion about Love). 'And what's the point of it?' he
would ask himself. 'Why not say simply in so many words--' and then he
would try to think for half an hour,--or was it two years and a
half?--how to say simply in so many words what love is. 'A figure like
that is manifestly untruthful,' he argued, 'for no dragon-fly, unless
under very exceptional circumstances, could live at the bottom of the
sea. And if literature is not the Bride and Bedfellow of Truth, what
is she? Confound it all,' he cried, 'why say Bedfellow when one's
already said Bride? Why not simply say what one means and leave it?'

So then he tried saying the grass is green and the sky is blue and so
to propitiate the austere spirit of poetry whom still, though at a
great distance, he could not help reverencing. 'The sky is blue,' he
said, 'the grass is green.' Looking up, he saw that, on the contrary,
the sky is like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall from
their hair; and the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls
fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods. 'Upon my
word,' he said (for he had fallen into the bad habit of speaking
aloud), 'I don't see that one's more true than another. Both are
utterly false.' And he /despaired/ of being able to solve the problem
of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into a deep
dejection. 75; emphasis mine
#+END_QUOTE
Here, like the narrator from the previous passage, Orlando
interrogates the truthfulness of figurative elements. The failure of
the "dragon-fly," the "bedfellow," and "bride" to signify love is only
the beginning of such an interrogation: for the crisis of
signification extends to seemingly objective realities, like the
passage of time. Furthermore, Orlando's rumination here illustrates
the way that the outer narration blends into Orlando’s interiority, a
blending that eventually casts into doubt on the consistency of
universal constants --"then he would try to think for half an hour,–or
was it two years and a half?" Orlando's doubt about language is
crystalized in the sentence which contains the key term, "despaired":
"he /despaired/ of being able to solve the problem of what poetry is
and what truth is and fell into a deep dejection." It seems that, for
Orlando, gender has something to do with the authority of language to
convey truth in plain terms, of "say[ing] what one means and leav[ing]
it." As Victoria L. Smith affirms, various scenes of the novel
similarly "thematiz[s] within the text how representation or, rather
more particularly, how literary language finds itself at a loss"
(Smith 68).

In a final example, I examine the co-occurance of words from both
lists within a single passage. The words, "curiosity," which is
associated with "man," and "seductiveness," which is associated with
"woman," appear in a passage that portrays desire as driven by gender
incomprehensibility. together portray gender a problem of expression
that is intimately coordinated with language. The drama begins when
Orlando, upon seeing Sasha for the first time, cannot tell whether she
is a man or a woman:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
He beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him
with the highest /curiosity/. The person, whatever the name or sex,
was about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed
entirely in oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar
greenish-coloured fur. But these details were obscured by the
extraordinary /seductiveness/ which issued from the whole
person. Images, metaphors of the most extreme and extravagant twined
and twisted in his mind. He called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive
tree, an emerald, and a fox in the snow all in the space of three
seconds; he did not know whether he had heard her, tasted her, seen
her, or all three together.... A melon, an emerald, a fox in the
snow--so he raved, so he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must
be--no woman could skate with such speed and vigour--swept almost on
tiptoe past him, Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that
the person was of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the
question.
#+END_QUOTE
For Orlando, the problem of language and gender has to do with
signification--he cannot resolve how to express either one--which
arises when he first sees Sasha. Within this undefined space, he uses
seemingly arbitrary metaphors, "a melon, a pinapple, an olive tree, an
emerald, and a fox in the snow" to describe Sasha. At the same time
that Orlando cannot place Sasha's gender, he also cannot find the
right words to describe her. 

As Sasha’s probable gender oscillates between male and female
throughout passage, Orlando’s desire crescendos. The narrative voice
and form of the sentences in this scene also shape the building
tension: the narration alternates interiority and description a in
free indirect discourse that jumps abruptly between narration and
interjections, to express a cyclical quality about Orlando’s confused
mental state. The effect is to mirror with language the tortuous
thought process that Orlando undergoes as he guesses then doubts the
reality of Sasha’s gender. While the tension thus mounts throughout
the passage, the relationship between gender and language comes to a
climax:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a boy’s, but
no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those breasts; no boy
had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from the bottom of
the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping a curtsey with the
utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past on the arm of some
Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a standstill. She was not
a handsbreadth off. She was a woman. 27-28
#+END_QUOTE
Athough the tension finally ebbs as Orlando settles on Sasha’s gender,
settling on the phrase, "She was a woman," the use of figuration and
form in this passage situate gender as something difficult, if not
impossible, to grasp. The lessson seems to be that if gender is
ambiguous, then language is also imprecise.

In filtering the shared contexts between "woman" and "man," coming
closer to a sense of gender /distinctiveness/ in this text, it is
important to emphasize that gender still descends from a binary
system--from the initial analysis of "woman" and "man." However, by
/iterating/ through distant and close reading, the terms swell with
significations that pluralize the binary. Like Butler's account of
gender subversion, this kind of computational analysis works toward
resignifying the initial understanding of "woman" and "man." Despite
the tight constraints of these computational work, there is a freedom
in the possibility of working the results into closer-reading
analysis. The rule here is iterativity which, as Butler suggests,
opens up the opportunity for subversion:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
The compulsion to repeat an injury is not necessarily the compulsion
to repeat the injury in the same way or to stay fully within the
traumatic orbit of that injury. The force of repetition in language
may be the paradoxical condition by which a certain agency---not
linked to a fiction of the ego as master of circumstance---is derived
from the impossibility of choice. 83 
#+END_QUOTE
Butler explains that the repetition of language is the condition
enables a certain agency to emerge. Through, repetition, dominant or
established meaning can be resignified. Taking Butler's concept of
"performative citation" as guidance, then, one may repeat the same
computation over and over again, with each new result expanding and
resignifying the initial understanding of binary gender.

*** TODO conclusion: on discursivity
The understanding of gender in this text is primarily discursive.
Pamela Caughie zeroes in on the indeterminacy language, finding that
it purposefully precludes a straightforward understanding of sex and
gender; as a result, "sex cannot be separated from text, the
grammatical from the gendered" (Caughie 51). According to Caughie:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Orlando works as a feminist text not because of what it says about
sexual identity but because of what it manages not to say; not because
of what it reveals about the relation between the sexes but because of
what it does to that relation; not because its protagonist is
androgynous but because its discourse is duplicitous" (Caughie 41).
#+END_QUOTE
This argument, that /Orlando/'s subversiveness is a discursive one,
that it operates through language, has led to further critiques of its
political significance,[fn:8] none more incisive than the critique
from Trans Studies. From the perspective of critics like Jay Prosser,
the discursive understanding of gender is precisely what allows
Orlando to transgress the norms of gender and sex in the
novel. According Prosser, Woolf's experimentation with language and
narrative form belies the physical the embodied reality of
transsexuality. He explains: "Orlando is not about the sexed body at
all but the cultural vicissitudes of gender. As h/er narrative propels
h/er through four centuries of history, Orlando is free to move beyond
h/er body--quite queerly, to break through the limits of the flesh"
(Prosser 168). By "the sexed body," Prosser means the physical body,
what Jack Halberstam describes as the "literal, the real, the
intractable flesh" which is bound by the rules and boundaries of the
physical and social world (Halberstam 314). That /Orlando/'s
transgressiveness results from a play of /language/ and /literary
form/ that elides the specificity and the lived reality of the "sexed
body" precludes the novel from being what Prosser would call a
"transsexual" text. Rather, due to its "ambivalence, a wavering around
transition", "a transformation of transition into new identity," its
"easy androgyny," this text is transgender (Prosser 169). As Caughie
asserts, /Orlando/'s transgressiveness comes from its discursive
moves: "Far from defeating sexual difference, as many feminist critics
claim, Orlando enacts it, enshrines it, exploits it, makes a spectacle
of it, but as a playful oscillation not a stable opposition" (Caughie
48). According to Prosser, such strategies frames gender as a
discursive (rather than embodied) phenomenon.

Interestingly, Prosser's critique is what aligns this text more
closely with Butler's concept of gender performativity, particularly
in the way that language is used to produce (and and reproduce) gender
identity. In other words, a /discursive/ understanding of gender is
one that can be destabilized, distorted, and/or reformulated through
language. Caughie attributes the emergence of gender transgression in
this novel to experiments in figuration and narrative form:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Sexual identity is assumed in language...  Woolf brings out the
arbitrariness of that identity, the arbitrariness of language itself,
through Orlando's switching from one sex to the other, and from one
poetic language to another, as well as through the shifting of her own
rhetoric in this novel. Caughie 42
#+END_QUOTE
This text, with its "switching" and "shifting" discourse, which at
once asserts that language is deficient and that it overshoots the
mark, that it conveys plainness and poetry, implies that gender is
also a shifting, formal phenomenon. Like Butler, Caughie presents a
vew of gender as discursive.

[fn:1] Some recent developments in distant reading combine with close
reading methods, as critics will use the results of quantitative
analysis to identify key moments from the text that merit closer
attention. Andrew Piper's methodology, which he calls "bifocal"
reading, demonstrates how distant and close reading are used together,
with distant reading providing the context or framework that guides
close reading"“We are no longer using our own judgments as
benchmarks... but explicitly constructing the context through which
something is seen as significant (and the means through which
significance is assessed).... It interweaves subjectivity with
objects” (Piper, Andrew. Enumerations: Data and Literary Study, 2018,
17).

[fn:3] Tie this relationship on the white/black binary to Eve
Sedgwick's points about binaries containing an oppostional dynamic in
which the subordinated term props up the dominant term.

[fn:4] Another popular critique comes from Political Philosophy, and
concerns a logical inconsitency in the way that Butler theorizes
subjectivity. If the resistance to signification comes from outside
the cycle of signification, from where does that external resistance
emerge? Does it not imply a pre-discursive identity or at least desire
for resistance? Geoff Boucher writes that Butler locates the potential
for subversion "in a disembodied intentionality that appears to stand
outside of the culturally-scripted subject positions that the
individual occupies" (115). He aptly questions: "Who (or what) decides
'how to repeat'? On what basis is the decision to subvert power made?"
(119).

[fn:5] In JavaScript, for example, the ~for loop~ is more convoluted:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
for (i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
  text += word[i] + "<br>";
} 
#+END_SOURCE

[fn:6] The language model for this computation comes from
Word2Vec's "glove-twitter-25" dataset.

[fn:7] Much of the scholarship on this text explores its resistance
against normative concepts of identity and gender. The experimental
use of language and narrative form creates a narrative that is
recalcitrant against coherent understandings of gender and
identity. Jane de Gay, Jill Channing, and Christy L. Burns, for
example, assert that Woolf deploys imaginative elements, magical
realism, and parody, respectively, to resist realism and narrative
expectations in her fictional biography. De Gay aligns Woolf's writing
with that of Walter Pater and Vernon Lee as a "feminist
historiography" that "rejected Victorian patriarchal metanarratives"
and instead "used the strategies of fiction to bring history alive and
make it live in the present" (de Gay 71). In a similar vein, Burns and
Channing both point out that Woolf uses fantastical elements, in the
former in the service of parody, and the latter as part of magical
realist writing, that disrupt expectations of plot and narrative to
challange the stability of gender and identity. Doubling down on the
role of langauge, some critics emphasize that the narration
purposefully obfuscates any resolution about concepts like gender,
identity, and even race and nationality. Victoria L. Smith asserts
that "The fantastic content in the novel is directly linked to the
undecidability/impossibility of the form of the novel and of the
protagonist" (58).

[fn:8] Jamie Hovey and Jessica Berman both explore how the text
challenges the boundaries of national identity through an implicit
critique of imperialism, a critique that emerges from the privileged
position of the white, British persective. Hovey remarks that
/Orlando/ is "an ambivalent articulation of English nationalism," a
nationalism that intersects with (and depends on) gender and race
(Hovey 394). Displacing the oppressive effects of nationalism to
racialized and sexually transgresive subjects, the novel "allows the
protagonist to pass as respectible and heterosexual" (Hovey
398). Bringing the question of transsexuality to the fore, Berman
argue that as a "trans text," /Orlando/ utilizes methods of marking
and categorizing bodies to interrogate the structures and boundaries
of nationality (Berman 218). According to Berman, "The transnational
situation as also intrinsically transgender" (Berman 218). Berman's
account harps on "the disruptive, critical energy of the prefix
'trans'" to unpack the concept of "nation" and "nationality" (Berman
220).
