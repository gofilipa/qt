*** chapter summary 
The burden of the chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of performativity, and how that
method enhances the critical process. It begins by debunking the
fantasy of falsifiable criticism, presenting a critique of moretti's
methodology and stylistic approach (eventually with accompanying text
analysis). It then goes into a critique of current distant reading
practices, discussing Ted Underwood, Nan Z. Da, to emphasize how these
practices can often reproduce the critic's assumptions. This section
also discusses the work of Johanna Drucker and Richard Jean So,
emphasizing that their methods do a good job deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I'm interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by producing new structures, or formalizations of these
texts. Then, I go into a history of textual scholarship, focusing
particularly on the work of Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode, who offer a deformative and speculative understanding
of critical analysis that is useful for my proposal. Then, I dip into
Queer Theory, in particular Judith Butler's concepts of performativity
and citation, which lend an understanding to the ways that critical
processes can subvert dominant structures through iteration, or
"performative citation." This notion of displacement through
repetition is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the
iterative process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures
that re-signify certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with
my reading of Virginia Woolf's /Orlando/, to show how our
understanding of "man" and "woman" in that text is re-signified
through this kind of text analysis.

** The fantasy of the falsifiable

*** intro - computing queerness
This chapter examines how quantitative text analysis, which is a way
of analyzing textual data by computation, such as counting word
frequency or generating associative word pairs, works with data about
queer subjectivity, in this case, with gender. I explore how
computational processing, which "cleans" and "normalizes" textual data
in preparation for quantification and statistical analysis, engages
with gender, which is not discrete or numerical, in text.

This examination probes the central tension between "Queer Form," or
figurative and narrative forms by which gender is expressed, and
digital formats, where the logics computation abstracts and transforms
text into data. I am not trying to ascertain whether gender, as an
aspect constitutive of identity (like race, class, or sexuality) can
or cannot be quantified. With enough gradations, anything can be
transformed into a digital format. However, preparing a text for text
analyis always requires a reduction of data in which some semantic
value has escaped. Processes like cleaning and normalizing, where text
is transformed into a format to make it computable, constrain textual
meaning. They are like passing text through a seive, filtering out its
specificities. For example, in order to be counted in a word
frequency, text has to be rid of elements like punctuation, articles,
prepositions, and word endings. Rather than attempt to recover this
semantic esccape, I am interested in exploring how possible approaches
for quantification might engage with queerness as a formal phenomenon,
or "queer form," what Kadji Amin, Amber Jamilla Musser, and Roy Pérez
describe as "the range of formal, aesthetic, and sensuous strategies
that make difference a little less knowable, visible, and
digestible."[fn:18] In other words, I am interested in how a specific
approach toward computation can formalize queerness in computation.

So, the question for this chapter is the following: how do we deform a
text to bring out elements of gender? To answer this question, we
begin by taking a close look at the approach toward text. We will
begin with our orientation toward reading. For the orientation we take
determines the intervention.

*** paranoid reading/symptomatic reading/militant reading

There are several orientations toward reading in literary analysis,
which determine the trajectory of readerly engagement with
texts. Taking the name of "paranoid reading," "sympotmatic," and
"militant reading," is a reading pratice that places importance in
what a text does not say, or what it cannot say.[fn:1] Descending from
the critical styles popularized by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and
Friedrich Nietzsche, this reading practice drives the conviction that
power structures (such as the economy, the unconscious, and moral
systems, for example) encode ideology which can be demystified by
critical analysis and exposure. In literary criticism, Eve Kofosky
Sedgwick calls this kind of reading /paranoid/ because it searches for
hidden elements of text that play into a larger narrative about a
system of oppression. For Sedgwick, this kind of reading places its
faith in the "drama of exposure," which will, once and for all,
finally reveal the truth (/Touching Feeling/ 8). Stephen Best and
Sharon Marcus define "symptomatic reading" in similar terms, as a
reading style that locates latent patterns or “absences, gaps, and
ellipses in texts,” to speculate upon “what those absences mean, what
forces create them, and how they signify the questions that motivate
the text” (3). Rita Felski describes this orientation as "militant"
because it grows from an affect of disenchantment between between
reader and text, where the reader enlists "to expose hidden truths and
draw out unflattering and counterintuitive meanings that others fail
to see" (1).

The styles of paranoid, symptomatic, and militant reading are unified
by a faith in something hidden in the text and in the power of its
revelation. The preoccupation with depth and absence implies a belief
in an underlying "correct" interpretation of a text, which will be
finally unearthed by the careful and astute analysis by the critic. 

In itself, so-called paranoid reading can be an exhilarating and
rewarding intellectual exercise for literary criticism. The danger of
this kind of reading, however, is that it encourages a kind of
criticism that it turns reading into a kind of mechanical practice
that searches for what is hidden within the text rather than what is
on its surface. Despite the pleasure and satisfaction of this exercise
in discovery, the process of analysis inevitably turns rote. It
discourages attention from the aesthetic qualities on the surface of
the text, focusing instead on what is hidden or absent. In the
process, the textual elements are conscripted into participating in
what Sedgwick calls "a binary mode of thinking," which searches
beneath, behind, or beyond the text, for what might affirm or deny the
overarching thesis. Rather than staying with the aesthetics of the
surface, which contains elements like narration, figuration, and other
devices, this process creates a formula for literary analysis where
such elements are implicated into a larger narrative about "repression
and liberation" (Sedgwick /Touching Feeling/ 12). Then, reading
becomes a mechanical practice of searching for what is hidden or
absent which will finally explain some latent meaning in the
text. This process is replicated as the search for meaning takes on
other texts, imposing the same structure on new material. As paranoia
seeks its own affirmation, its nature is to spread, reflecting and
confirming its own image on every surface. This method, each time,
will surface something new, but never entirely novel, and with each
iteration, the "truth" with each revelation has less and less power to
shock.

Sedgwick rightly "see[s] a cognitive danger in these interpretations:
a moralisitic tautology that became increasingly incabable of
recognizing itself as such" (12). This kind of reading will never
account for a range of responses to text, and particularly, to the
subjects who perform text analysis. It will never move beyond the
standardized script of reproducibility.

*** DR begins in the falsifiable, toward valuing reproducibility
[Computational methods give the critic more absence to mine in the
form of "big data." Distant reading by Moretti ramps up the apparent
"automation" in analysis toward furthering criticism]

This kind of reading can be particularly taken with digital methods
for literary criticism. In digital methods like quantitative text
analysis, often called "Distant Reading," the focus of reading for
what is hidden or absent can be exacerbated with the desire to read at
scale. Because computers can process hundreds of texts at a time,
"reading" at much faster rates than humans they offer critics an
opportunity for getting around the problem of literary scale, and
particularly attract critics who pose ambitious questions about
literary history.

Distant Reading is a way of computing textual data by cleaning,
sorting, and counting textual elements, and can involve more advanced
processes like statistical modelling and machine learning. It borrows
from a variety of quantitative methods in the social sciences and
applies them to textual data, for example in word association, topic
modeling and sentiment analysis. Though they differ in their
specifics, these methods share a faith in using the speed of
computation, which can process very precise elements like word
frequency or patterns, to make calculations about how to categorize or
organize textual data. Moreover, they are made to be used as part of a
scientific method, to help researchers conduct experiments that prove
or falsify their hypotheses. The scientific method is a cyclical
process, wherein researchers make observations on a certain topic,
formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis with experiments, analyze
and report the results, bringing them toward new observations,
hypotheses, experiments, and conclusions. In order for the process to
move forward, the hypothesis must be /falsifiable/, meaning that it
must be contestable -- one must be able to imagine an
alternative. This falsifiability ensures that the hypothesis can be
meaningfully tested.

Distant Reading furthers many of the impulses of paranoid reading by
applying this paranoia to vast swaths of literary
history. Quantitative methodologies accord well with research programs
that seek answers to big, previously unwieldy questions. Franco
Moretti, for example, explores how social and economic forces impact
literary form in the development of the modern novel. Moretti's work
is interested in drawing connections among a field of data (texts)
that would otherwise be too large and unweildy to work with--he
declares that "distance... is a condition of knowledge" (/Distant
Reading/ 48). More recently, Ted Underwood, in the field of
Computational Literary Studies (CLS), harnesses the power of
quantification and machine learning to glimpse what he calls the
"distant horizon" of literary trends across centuries[fn:2]. Recent
developments in distant reading combine with close reading methods, as
critics will use the results of quantitative analysis to identify key
moments from the text that merit closer attention.[fn:3]

It is important to examine where these impulses emerge. Moretti, who
is largely responsible for popularizing the practice of DR in English
Studies contexts, greatly influenced the ways that English scholars
approach quantiative methodologies. 

In Moretti's early essay, "The Soul and the Harpy" (1983),[fn:4] he
divulges a key motive in developing his methodological approach, which
will eventually flourish into "distant reading." Underlying Moretti’s
methodology is a deep concern with finding a way to ascertain the
effect of historical forces on literary form. But the current
practices of literary criticism present methodological obstacle. In
this early essay, Moretti characterizes literary criticism as "a sort
of cultivated accompaniment to reading – to the reading we are doing
here and now," ("The Soul and the Harpy" 21). By this, he means that
the analytical practices of contemporary literary critics, which
"revolve around concepts such as ‘ambiguity’ and the like," will,
according to Moretti, "always be pushed into multiplying, rather than
reducing, the obstacles every social science encounters when it tries
to give itself a testable foundation" (22). To illustrate the
practices of current literary criticism, Moretti distinguishes between
the historian and the student of literature:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The [student] – unless desirous of turning into that legendary figure
whose only pleasure lay in contemplating his own reflection – must
concentrate on the dissimilarities and ruptures: on what has been lost
and become irretrievably unfamiliar, and which we can 're-familiarize'
only by doing such violence to it that we distort the objective,
material consistency of every work which it is the task of scientific
knowledge to reconstruct and 'salvage'. 14
#+END_QUOTE
According to Moretti, the great danger in literary criticism is the
encouragement of narcissistic tendencies in researchers, whose attempt
to "re-familiarize" the object of study does it "violence". Moretti's
proposed method take a scientific approach that maintains the
"objective, material consistency" of the work. Here, Moretti proposes
a mode of critical inquiry that borrows from the sciences to minimize
the potential for difference and disagreement. In hope of grounding
the critical process on a more solid foundation, Moretti calls for a
"falsifiable criticism" that can "test" literary interpretations, much
like a social science ("The Soul and the Harpy" 21). Falsifiable
criticism would pursue interpretations as "coherent, univocal, and
complete," where the "results" can be compared with "data" which
"appear contradictory or inexplicable in the light of the hypothesis
itself" (21). He envisions a literary criticism that will slowly but
steadily progress toward irrefutable knowledge of literary objects:
"The day criticism gives up the battle cry ‘it is possible to
interpret this element in the following way’, to replace it with the
much more prosaic ‘the following interpretation is impossible for such
and such a reason’, it will have taken a huge step forward on the road
of methodological solidity" (22).

This quotation is significant because it shows how distant reading
descends from a desire to rid the critic's subjectivity from the
analytical process. Moretti's critique of literary methods is
erroneous for three reasons. First, the notion that familiarizing the
object of study (which presumably refers to the process of close
reading and textual interpretation) misunderstands the way that
violence has historically worked through separation, creating
unsurmountable borders, or distance between subjects and objects
(Anzaldua). Second, there is no "objective" reading of an object --
this is an imperialist illusion -- there is only the structuring power
which determines the ways that objects are read and interpreted
(Foucault). Finally, the allusion to narcissus is ironic, for
reflection is a function of of distance, not proximity. In attempting
to create an objective "distance" between himself and the work,
Moretti only succeeds in projecting his own presumptions.

Moretti's falsifiable criticism eventually grows into "distant
reading," and particularly, "quantitative formalism," which quantifies
literary form (specifically, genre) through quantitative methods that
result in visualization, such as graphs and diagrams. Moretti's use of
quantitative formalism conscripts digital methods toward the same kind
of truth searching in paranoid reading practices. He does this by
placing the burden and faith of knowing on the computer, attributing
the bulk of analytical work to computational and visualization
processes, and relegating the literary critic's role to explain the
results of the computer's analyses. The essays in /Distant Reading/
increasingly demonstrate how his critical method streamlines into the
neat, recursive processes of hypothesis, collecting and assembling
data, and inference. The results are often unexpected, and sometimes
bring Moretti to reframe his hypotheses. For example, in “Style, Inc.:
Reflections on 7,000 Titles (British Novels, 1740-1850),” Moretti
plots book titles on a series of graphs in order to explore how market
forces influence the titles. He offers that "the title is where the
novel as language meets the novel as commodity" (181). He finally
concludes that titles are quite sensitive to the market: "As the
market expands, titles contract; as they do that, they learn to
compress meaning; and as they do that, they develop special ‘signals’
to place books in the right market niche” (204). This is an exciting
interpretation, which is borne by the various graphs of title lengths
over time, but a closer look at Moretti's language obscures the extent
to which his critical process involves interpretation at every step:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In what follows, I focus on three moments of this history: first, I
/describe/ a major metamorphosis of eighteenth-century titles, and
/try to explain/ its causes; next, I /suggest/ how a new type of title
that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of
novels; and finally, I /make a little attempt/ at quantitative
stylistics, examining some strategies by which titles point to
specific genres. Three sections, three pieces in the large puzzle of
the literary field. (181-2; emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
This language presents the literary critic's work as an objective
description of unproblematic reality. Additionally, although his
speculations are provocative, Moretti presents them as supplementary
to the graphs. Moretti’s diminishing language--he describe[s], tr[ies]
to explain, suggest[s] and make[s] a little attempt--belies the nature
of his intervention. After all, it is Moretti who poses the question,
inputs the data, and draws conclusions from the graphs. The
quantification ability of the computer emboldens Moretti to make
larger claims about literary history, all the while diminishing his
role as in analysis. His approach almost appears to aim toward
reproducing analysis to the point of automation.

With the rise of digital methods like distant reading, the faith in
the reproducible also grows, and even dominates the thinking of those
who are generally critical of distant reading in literary studies. For
example, Nan Z. Da, in her critique of scholars like Underwood, argues
that quantitative methods, which belong in scientific methodologies,
are ill-suited for literary studies. She accusses Underwood and other
distant reading practitioners for trading "speed for accuracy, and
coverage for nuance" (620). Of her many gripes with quantitative
methods, which include "technical problems, logical fallacies," and a
"fundamental mismatch betwen the statistical tools that are used and
the objects to which they are applied" (601), she emphasizes the lack
of reproducible results, the idea that one researcher's process can be
reproduced by another with identical output. She demonstrates this
lack of reproducibility with an experiment of Topic Modelling, which
is the processing of large texts in order to generate a number of
"topics" within the corpus. Researchers often use Topic Modelling as a
way of speed-reading a massive corpus to get a sense of what it is
about without having to read the text in full. Da attempts to verify
the results of a Topic Modelling experiment by replicating the process
on her own machine, a replication that fails.[fn:5] She concludes
that, "if the method were effective, someone with comparable training
should be able to use the same parameters to get basically the same
results" (628-629). This is looking over the fact that topic modeling
will return vastly different results with even slightly different
paramters,[fn:6] for Da, reproducibility of method is a benchmark for
reviewing and assessing the efficacy of quantification.

This kind of reproducible criticism is where Moretti's fantasy of the
falsifiable leads. Despite their vastly different committments,
scholars like Moretti align with Da on the value that they place on
the computer: Moretti in seeking a falsifiable method; and Da in
suggesting that CLS methods fail in their goal to resemble the social
sciences. In both cases, there is a implicit faith that the computer
can do some of the analytical work that has been traditionally
ascribed to the human.

*** Ramsay and Drucker's speculative methods
There are literary critics who, eschewing the temptation of the
paranoia, employ the "distance" of distant reading toward more
speculative and creative ends. Stephen Ramsay, for example, approaches
"the rigid, inexorable, uncompromising logic of algorithmic
transformations" as an opportunity for contemplative analysis
(32). Rather than solve problems or answer questions definitively, he
engages in readings that are inescapably partial and
speculative. Ramsay explains that computational methods enhance
current reading strategies by harnessing the constraints of
computation so that new readings may flourish: “The computer
revolutionizes, not because it proposes an alternative to the basic
hermeneutical procedure, but because it reimagines that procedure at
new scales, with new speeds, and among new sets of conditions”
(31). Activities such as compiling word frequency lists, diagramming
social relationships, or plotting various textual data not only
transform texts into new forms from which the critic may speculate,
but are grounded in inherently critical moves, such as asking
questions or identifying problems. Ramsay maintains that all critical
reading is a deformative activity insofar as it prioritizes certain
textual data such as formal patterns, words, devices over others and
delivers a new "paratext." For example, in his analysis of Virginia
Woolf’s novel /The Waves/, Ramsay uses a computer program to generate
lists of distinctive terms uttered by each of the six speakers in the
novel. Ramsay emphasizes how this method “puts forth not the
[original] text, but a new text in which the data has been
paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (16). To
say, as a result, that the word frequencies "confirm" or "verify" what
other critics have argued about the characters assumes that literary
criticism aims for singular answers. Rather, the point of such an
exercise is to “unleash the potentialities” of the text, offering
opportunities for new readings (33). Ramsay point out that “we are not
trying to solve Woolf. We are trying to ensure that discussion of /The
Waves/ continues” (15). Here, the goal is a rhetorical exercise:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The understanding promised us by the critical act arises not from a
presentation of facts, but from the elaboration of a gestalt, and it
rightfully includes the vague reference, the conjectured similitude,
the ironic twist, and the dramatic turn. In the spirit of inventio,
the critic freely employs the rhetorical acts of conjecture—not so
that a given matter can be settled, but in order that the matter might
become richer, deeper, and ever more complicated. 16
#+END_QUOTE
Ramsay's method uses speed and efficiency of the machine to reflect
back upon the critic, to give the critic more material and more
opportunity for the creativity and speculation that characterizes
literary analysis. 

Like Ramsay, Johanna Drucker is interested in exploring how the
computer engages with the critic's analytical process. Drucker,
however, directs her reading toward deconstructing the objectivity of
the machine. She is careful to dispell the illusion of "raw data,"
which comes already reduced to fit whatever parameters required by
analysis. Because data always undergoes a transformation in order to
be quantified, its complexity has already been compromised. As a
result, Drucker argues, quantification techniques such as
visualizations in graphs and charts inevitably misrepresent the data
they are meant to convey. To illustrate this process, Drucker presents
a chart displaying the amount of books published over several
years. The chart appears to convey production during this specific
time period, but Drucker explains that publication date is an
arbitrary metric for capturing production.[fn:7] She brings to the
surface all the assumptions made in such a metric, for example, the
limitations of "novel" as a genre and the connotations behind
"published," which suggests date of appearance, but has no indication
of composition, editing, review, distribution. Each piece of data
carries with it the result of many interpretive decisions, that carry
with them varying degrees of opacity, which are all necessary in order
to present complex concepts like book production as a bar on a
chart. Drucker explains: "the graphical presentation of supposedly
self-evident information... conceals these complexities, and the
interpretative factors that bring the numerics into being, under a
guise of graphical legibility" (Drucker par. 23).

To resist the reductions of "data," a term that deceptively connotes
that which is "given," Drucker proposes thinking of data as "capta,"
which suggests that which is taken. Drucker's "capta" is deliberately
creative, turning graphical expressions into expressive metrics:
components used for measurement, like lines or bars on a graph, break,
blur, or bleed into one another. Objects are not discrete entities,
but interact with the other objects in the visualization. For example,
in a bar graph of book publications by year, she warps the graphical
metrics, making some of them fuzzy, wider, shorter, in an attempt to
show that publication as a metric elides other information such as
composition, editing, purchasing, etc.

[[./img/Drucker.png]]

Emphasizing "capta" is a way of figuring elements that have been
reduced, resolved, or ignored in traditional quantitative
analysis. Drucker makes evident what is overlooked or assumed when
dealing with complex subjects by muddling (rather than simplifying)
the relationship between elements.

*** Orientation makes the difference: falsifiable vs speculative
In a certain sense, all of the above critics, Moretti, Da, Ramsay and
Drucker, rely on speculation in their criticism. First, there is
significant overlap between distant reading and speculative computing
in that they visualize or arrange textual data to stimulate
analysis. Moretti, after all, is using visualization to spark his
imagination and make conjectures, which he describes as
"explanations." In the pursuit of the falsifiable, Moretti evacuates
much of his method's creative potential. The difference is that
Moretti's Distant Reading uses makes conjectures within a falsifiable
framework. The difference between them, therefore, has to do with
their approach or orientation in using quantitative methods. Moretti
and Da show how computational methods encourage a "falsifiable" method
of literary criticism that mimics the methodologies of the
sciences. Alternatively, Ramsay and Drucker demonstrate how these
methods can also be used toward explicitly speculative ends, and for
Drucker in particular, with a sensitivity that is critical of
anlaytical processes.

The role of paranoia in distant reading perpetuates the reproducible
approach, which blocks out other kinds of connection to
text. Moretti's method stems from a suspicious conviction that the
archive of literary history has something to hide. Rita Felski
explains that the desire in a “hermeneutics of suspicion,” which she
calls a militant mode of reading forecloses possibilities of
connection and being moved by these texts. Because critics are focused
on unearthing or discovering secrets in the text, it reduces the
interaction between reader and text to an intellectual
activity. Felski wonders what if we allowed ourselves to be marked or
struck by what we read. Then, rather than just be a cognitive
activity, reading can become an “embodied mode of attentiveness that
involves us in acts of sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering, and
engaging” (176). A critic like Ramsay, for example, is not only
willing to be surprised, his critical process is driven by a desire
for surprise. And Drucker, although not driven by surprise, is
searching for ways to disrupt assumptions about handling and
processing graphical data.

*** Deconstructing social categories & computing for indeterminacy

The reason reproducibility is so dangerous is because it blocks out
other opportunities for relation to text. This project, in particular,
looks at distant reading for queer texts, and for how it might attend
to some of the more slippery concepts of social categories such as
gender. How might distant reading analyze gender ontology? In order to
address marginalized aspects of identity, in a way that does not
reproduce our assumptions, we have to ask questions that do not assume
that we already know the kind of thing we are looking for.

One example of distant reading explores how to handle questions of
racial identity and discourse in novels. Richard Jean So and Edwin
Roland use machine learning to explore the constructedness of racial
categories by experimenting with an algorithm that evaluates an
author's race according to the vocabulary used by the author. When
they look more closely into these results of using the algorithm on a
large corpora of novels by white and black authors, they find that it
reveals different levels of variance in words traditionally attributed
to white and black authors: while novels by white authors are
distinguished by a low variance in this vocabulary, novels by black
authors show a greater variance in vocabulary (66). They conclude that
white authorship, as a category, only coheres against the incoherence
of black authorship. In other words, they find that whiteness
/depends/ on the characterization of blackness.[fn:8] 

Much in the same vein as Drucker, So and Roland's position is that
this quantitative excercise is more useful for what it teaches us
about the machine, rather than what it teaches us about race. They
decide to explore one of the errors that the machine made, isolating
one text, James Baldwin's novel, /Giovanni's Room/ (1956), which was
wrongly categorized as being written by a white author. So and Roland
point out that this misclassification recalls a critical debate about
this text's notorious elision of explicit references to race, whereby
blackness is displaced in favor of an implicit whiteness. In the six
words in /Giovanni's Room/ revealed by the algorithm which influence
the categorization as a white-authored text, one of them is the term
"appalled." So and Roland point out the connotations of whiteness in
"appalled," which has the middle French root, "apalir," meaning "to
grow pale" (71). They discover that this term occurs only once in the
text, in the early scene where David (the narrator) describes his
relationship to his father. Here, David regrets his father's
friendliness which comes at the expense of a paternal aspect: "I did
not want to be his buddy. I wanted to be his son. What passed between
us as masculine candor exhausted and appalled me" (Rpt. in So and
Roland 71). They insightfully conclude that the word "appalled" in the
text marks "the moment David develops a troubled relationship to
normative masculinity [as] also the moment he becomes 'white'"
(71). Taking the computer's mistake as a starting point, their
analysis thus contributes to the ongoing debate about the imbrication
between race and sexuality in the novel.

So and Roland assert that, while "Race is a category that escapes
measurement or simply renders it untenable," the machine is an apt
tool for studying this category" (60). In a sense, So and Roland are
confronting the same problem as Da: what is the effect of
computational error in literary criticism? But rather than write off
quantitative methods, So and Roland suggest an interesting way out of
the problem: use the error as a starting point for further analysis,
which probes the constructedness of gender ontology. Because race is a
social construct, and machines only impute meaning that is encoded
into them, than it stands to reason that machines might be ideal
instruments for studying the construction of race. Computational error
becomes an opportunity for exploring the encoding of racial
identity. Looking more closely at the specific results of this
analysis, like the function of the term "appalled" in /Giovanni's
Room/, they can make more daring leaps of speculation about how
whiteness, while displacing blackness, also gestures toward a troubled
understanding of gender and potentially, sexuality. So and Roland
assert that: "If the general class of the misclassified points to the
erosion of the machine's initial binary understanding of white and
black, a close analysis of a single misclassified text can reveal what
precisely motivates that ontological undoing" (68). Thus they turn the
central mismatch between data analysis, which works to "identify and
label objects," and minority discourse analysis, which "critique[s]
and problematize[s] the very idea of categories," into a point for
interrogation (63). In this case, the algorithm allows researchers to
interrogate how whiteness as a category depends on the contrast of
blackness as "other." Rather than being "fundamentally mismatched,"
the machine and minority discourse are particularly suited for one
another, as the machine uses highly constructed and reductive method
that allows practitioners to deconstruct social categories.

The example with "appalled" is totally idiosyncratic--the word occurs
once through the entire novel. But paying attention to error upends
the value of reproducibility by combining a deconstructive and
speculative approach. The researchers run a computation, look for an
error, and use that error as an opportunity to learn about the ways
that categories are constructed. They are using computers in an
unintuitive way, computing for indeterminacy.

*** Underwood: reproducing gender

Using quantitative analysis to study gender in literary texts is not a
new endeavor. One prominent distant reading practitioner, Ted
Underwood, studies the way that gender markers in novels change over
time. Underwood's method deploys statistical modelling, in which a
sample of data is used to make predictions about larger groups of
data. He uses machine learning, or programs "trained" by certain data
sets, to create models that can then make predictions on other
datasets. Underwood's aim to to measure how effective computers are at
analyzing certain textual elements based on previous analyses. He
calls his approach "perspectival modelling." He explains that, "Since
learning algorithms rely on examples rather than fixed definitions,
they can be used to model the tacit assumptions shared by particular
communities of production or reception" ("Machine Learning and Human
Perspective" 93). In a review of Underwood's work, Dan Sinykin writes
that "Against the purported objectivity of algorithms, he leverages
the human prejudices built into modeling toward humanistic ends"
(par. 4).[fn:9] 

One of Underwood's projects examines gender roles in novels from the
18th century to the 21st century by using a model that predicts the
the sex of a fictional character based on the words associated with
that character. Underwood explains how the test is configured:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, verbs
they govern and so on--excluding only words that explicitly name a
gendered role like /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters,
labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The
algorithm will learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine'
purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories. The
model produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
characters, previously unseen. /Distant Horizons/ 115
#+END_QUOTE
In simplest terms, the program studies some given adjectives
associated with a male or female character in order to make
predictions about other characters' genders. Inevitably, the resulting
output is always determined by this initial input. Underwood carefully
asserts that these models suggest, not the truth of gender ontology,
but the approaches and choices made by those who create the models:
"Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and
rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence
used to train them" ("Machine Learning and Human Perspective"
92). This particular model reveals that that, over time, gender roles
in novels become more flexible while the actual number of female
characters declines (/Distant Horizons/ 114). The graph shows a steady
overlapping of words traditionally associated with women, such as
"heart," with words typically assoicated with men, like "passion,"
toward the middle of the 20th century. One of the many explanations
for this result, Underwood reasons, is that the practice of writing
becomes more commonly pursued as a male occupation in the middle of
the 20th century than it was previously (/Distant Horizons/ 137). This
fact, coupled with the tendency of men to write more about men than
women, suggests why less women writing would led to a decline in
female characters. This explains how Underwood's seemingly paradoxical
conclusion, that gender roles become more flexible while the actual
prevalence of women dissapates from fiction, might be possible.

[[./img/Underwood.png]]

There are two important things to point out about Underwood's
analysis. First is that his specific method for text analysis is
logistic regression analysis, which is made for modelling binary
variables. A logistic regression expresses information in the form of
a probability, often between yes/no, pass/fail, win/lose, etc. In
Underwood's case, the probability is male/female. The output therefore
conforms to this binary model. Second, beyond the methodology, there
is a larger issue with the question that Underwood poses, for the
results the results of Underwood's "perspectival modeling" can only be
as good as the questions he asks. From a critical gender perspective,
Underwood's question imposes the very structure that he is attempting
to deconstruct. In other project where he similarly measures the
"transformations" of gender across time periods, he explains that
simplification is necessary ("Machine Learnig and Human Perspective"
93):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I recognize that gender theorists will be frustrated by the binary
structure of the diagram. To be sure, this binary has folded back on
itself, in order to acknowledge that social systems look different
from different positions in the system. But the diagram does still
reduce the complex reality of gender identification to two public
roles: men and women. I needed a simple picture, frankly, in order to
explain how a quantitative model can be said to represent a
perspective. "Machine Learning" 98
#+END_QUOTE
Underwood admits that he needs a "simple" model in order to bring into
relation the dynamics of gender (See Fig. 2).[fn:10] In aiming for
simplicity, however, he underestimates the extent to which his initial
assumptions will affect the final result. Although he considers the
possibility that he finds a structural tension between gender "because
[he] explores gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition"
(/Distant Horizons/ 140), he neglects to consider how the collapsing
of gender into a single graph perpetuates the structural categories of
male/female in a way that neglects the assumptions behind such a
category.[fn:11] The issue is not just with the assumptions at the
outset which reproduces the result, but with the guiding question of
the entire project, which is not about deconstructing gender, but
about reifying it. Asking a machine to replicate the conscription of
gender as male/female for the purpose of seeing how male and female
roles in novels change over time only creates a model of gender that
is "simple" enough to be computed by the system. 

How does simplifying the concept of gender contribute to our study of
it? This is not to say that there aren't ways of opening up our
understanding of gender by exploring it as a binary system. However,
Underwood's approach seeks a singular answer to the question of gender
roles. From this perspective, gender is a problem with an answer, an
answer that can be reproduced and verified. Underwood himself states:
"the data I can legally provide -- lists of word frequencies
associated with each volume or fictional character -- should allow
intrepid readers to retrace the most debatable parts of the
argument. An argument that can be retraced in this manner is
'reproducible'" (Underwood, /Distant Horizons/ 173). He continues, "If
my conclusions hold true in different subsets of the literary past,
they are not just reproducible but 'replicable'" (Underwood, /Distant
Horizons/ 174). This is an important example of how paranoid reading
can trap one in what Sedgwick describes as a "binary mode of
thinking," where textual elements are conscripted into meaning one
thing or the other (/Touching Feeling/ 2).

*** Mandell: deconstructing/multiplying gender 
Laura Mandell explores solutions for approaching the reduction of
gender as data, into what she calls the "M/F binary."[fn:12] Mandell
demonstrates how the M/F binary is reified "by presenting conclusions
about “male” and “female” modes of thinking and writing as if the M/F
terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently
referential and not discursively constituted" (par. 5). Mandell's
examination marshalls key findings from feminist theory, drawing from
Judith Butler, among others, to assert that gender is a socially
constituted category, a "performance" that can be historicized. She
illustrates the guiding power of the M/F binary in her critique of
Jockers and Rybicki, which find that they essentialize gender by
relying on stereotypes in their premises.

Mandell uses stylometry, as well as word-frequency analysis, and topic
modeling to examine gender in writing. Such methods are often used in
assessing authorship and authenticity, and stylometry in particular
predates computing and has notable cases in English Renaissance drama
and biblical texts. Generally, stylometry evaluates writing style by
extracting and analysing distinctive features in text. Often used in
stylometry, word-frequency analysis examines word usage to determine
authorship of a text. Topic modeling, as explained above, is the
generation of categories or "topics" about text. Mandell uses the
popular stylometry measurement, "Burrow's Delta," which visualizes the
"distance" between writing styles by creating branches (or "deltas")
between different texts. Specifically, Mandell's analysis focuses on
the "most frequent, little words (“a,” “of,” “the”), as well as
keywords." 

Mandell suggests that quantitative methods can open up the way we
deconstruct our understanding of quantification and gender. She points
out that gender, which is "constructed both by the measurer and the
measured," is never just about gender, but contains multiple
assumptions. To demonstrate how gender is "constructed," she poses a
counter experiment with genre, which finds that genre analysis cuts
across the gender binary. She comapres the stylistic qualities of a
female writer, Mary Wollenstonecraft, against two male writers,
William Godwin and Samuel Johnson, revealing that: "Wollstonecraft’s
sentimental anti-Jacobin novels most resemble Godwin’s sentimental
anti-Jacobin novels... whereas her essays most resemble Johnson’s
writings" (par. 29). Wollenstonecraft's writing resembles both male
and female writing, depending on the genre. To analyze the highly
constructed category of "gender," then, one must also consider genre:
"separating gender from other markings (genre, era of composition) is
not possible: historical time and genre are not incidental to, but
constitutive of, gender" (par. 35).

Admitting the constructed nature of gender allows researchers "to
experiment with new taxonomies of gender" (par. 37). Most usefuly,
Mandell's work points out how the computer is ideal for drawing
attention to the multiplicity of gender. The potential for complex
data models potentially allows researchers to "break the strength of
the signal" in the M/F binary by creating new categories, such as
"'men writing as men,' 'women writing as women,' 'women writing as
men,' 'men writing as women,' 'unspecified (anonymous) writing as
men,'" and so on (par. 35). Moreover, her emphasis on visualization
and movement inform how one might "animate numerical processes rather
than fixing their results as stereotype" (par. 7). The dynamicity of
computation, which allows one to run data iteratively, feeding new
inputs into new results, complicates any straighforward understanding
of the M/F binary. Mandell explains that “Computer screens... afford
the fluid exploration of parameters and taxonomies, through which many
sorts of experiments can be tested: interactive visualizations can
give us not objective answers rooted in aggressively reductive
oppositions, but parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very
complex reality” (par. 38).

However, Mandell's emphasis on how genre helps to constitute gender
overlooks a crucial aspect about gender--that it is highly
constitutive, in turn, of subjectivity. The similarities that Mandell
draws between gender and genre evacuate how gender is /constitutive/
of the subject. Borrowing from Butler, she argues that both gender and
genre are a performance "are... highly imitable" (par. 30), and
asserts that "Anyone can adopt gendered modes of behavior, just as
anyone can write in genres stereotypically labeled M/F"
(par.30). Here, she takes Butler's points about gender as a
performance in /Gender Trouble/ too literally. As Butler clarifies in
her later work, performativity is a process which is compulsory and
habitual, rather than a singular act. Crucially, Butler asserts that
gender /precedes/ and /constitutes/ the subject. In /Bodies that
Matter/, her follow-up to /Gender Trouble/, Butler explicitly warns
against the interpretation that gender is decided by the subject, to
be put on and off at will like clothing. Rather, according to Butler,
the subject /is produced/ by gender; gender is more like a mechanism
that allows the subject to emerge: "construction is neither a subject
nor its act, but a process of reiteration by which both 'subjects' and
'acts' come to appear at all" (xviii). This is not to say that Mandell
is wrong about gender being constructed, but that her assumption, that
"categories such as gender are being constructed both by the measurer
and the measured" misses an important point about the way that gender
constitutes subjectivity (par. 38). According to Butler, the subject
only emerges as an effect of gendered performance. To analyze gender,
one might look at the ways that it constitutes and constrains
subjectivity.

*** computation & gender mutually enlightening

This aspect about gender being constitutive has a generative parallel
to computation. As Mandell points out, "Computation enables
complexity" (par. 36). And computation, like gender, is also highly
constrained. There are rules and protocols that govern the way that
text is processed and analyzed. 

Computation and gender, as highly constrained, can be mutually
enlightening. They can allow us to explore the formal characteristics
of each--seeing constraint in the forms of different data models,
visualizations, etc. 

Computation is ideal for deconstruction. As So and Roland demonstrate
with the categories of white and black authorship, the limitations of
computation help point out the bounds of social categories as a
constructed phenomenoa.

Additionally, computation might work within the frame of
speculation. This kind of work would explore the constraints of gender
and computation as enabling constraints. Quantitative methods deal
with the unknown: "the point of numbers in social science is not to
impose determinism but to acknowledge uncertainty" (Underwood,
/Distant Horizons/ 186) While the work of So and Roland is essential
for bringing together quantitative and critical race discourses, it
also doesn't give enough credit to the ways that /computers/, in
presenting formalized schemas of race, /transform/ data toward
speculative ends. What if we began with the error? What if, in
addition to using the machine to study human constructs, we used the
machine to spur human thinking? This chapter takes exactly this
approach to study the marginalized aspects of gender ontology. This
chapter looks for ways that Digital Humanists might deploy text
analysis for the study of gender. In doing so, it draws from the
speculative and computationally critical approaches of digital
humaninists like Ramsay, Drucker, and from the attention to
deconstructing social categories from So, Roland, and Mandell. How do
we take what these theorists are doing with text analysis and apply it
toward the study of gender? We need a method that attends to the
particularity of gender construction and ontology.

If we are going to analyze gender, we must consider how it constitutes
and constrains other elements in the text. In applying digital tools
to the study of gender, we ought to be wary of the temptation to
approach gender as a secretive element of the text. How do we approach
the study of gender in a way that avoids the pitfalls of a paranoid
stance? To avoid this paranoid position, we might look to engage with
gender as an aestheticized quality, as something that operates on the
surface of the text, without conscripting it into the logic of
"prohibition and repression," in Sedgwick's words (/Touching Feeling/
10). I turn to distant reading, not to help reveal what is invisibly
encoded in my text of study, but for the ways that it allows me to
re-read the surface of the text. Moving forward, the question is--How
can we read gender not by what it hides, but what it shows? This
chapter proposes a method of reading that grapples with the tension to
unearth hidden, latent, or absent meaning in text. The stakes are
about preserving the role of the aesthetics in critique. How can the
reconfiguration--the abstraction--provided by the machine allow us to
engage with queerness in texts?

*** TODO orlando close reading - gender as enabling constraint

In what follows, I will demonstrate how gender functions as an
enabling constraint in Virginia Woolf's text, /Orlando: A
Biography/. /Orlando/ is a fictional biography that follows the life
of the eponymous 16th-century English nobleman as he undergoes a sex
change and lives into the 20th century as a woman.

First, the theme of gender in the novel is closely tied to that of
narrative perspective. As he recounts the life of Orlando, the
biographer-narrator mocks the techniques of historical biographers by
continualling calling into question the ability of language to
adequately describe life. From the beginning, the text displays the
biographer's ambivalence about how to describe Orlando and presents
two possible perspectives--that of the poet, and that of the
biographer. The passage begins with the narrator noting Orlando's
exquisite beauty: "A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible
to find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still the biographer who
records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he
invoke the help of novelist or poet" (12). Here, the biographer
declares Orlando’s beautiful face a good subject for biography. He
asserts his aims are to record Orlando as a scribe, "following after"
him, "from deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office"
(12). Then, as the passage progresses, the narrator relies on
figuration:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The red of the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on
the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The
lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an
exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in
its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted
closely to the head. But [..] directly we glance at Orlando standing
by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets,
so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened
them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between
the two blank medallions which were his temples. Directly we glance at
eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes
and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is
the aim of every good biographer to ignore. 12-13
#+END_QUOTE
Honoring his committment for straightforward narration, the
description of Orlando's face begins soberly enough with simple
sentence structure that describe Orlando's features with some
insertion of modest figurative comparisons (the "peach down" ob the
lips, teeth of "an exquisite and almond whiteness," the "tense flight"
of the "arrowy nose," etc). However, when the biographer arrives to
Orlando's eyes and forehead, his style ascends into full-fledged
figuration: he "must admit that [Orlando] had eyes like drenched
violets, so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and
widened them." The biographer's problem, that Orlando is too beautiful
for literal description--“Directly we glance at the eyes and forehead,
we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every
good biographer to ignore”--requires him to draw on the strategies of
the poet, using imagery and simile.

At a key moment of the text, the moment of Orlando's transition into a
woman, the biographer again grapples with the challenge to describe
Orlando's life in a way that is objective and literal, in keeping with
the principles of biography. As he tries to piece together the events
of Orlando's sex change, the biographer explains that the record of
Orlando’s life at this stage is incomplete: "It is, indeed, highly
unfortunate, and much to be regretted that at this stage of Orlando's
career... we have least information to go upon" (88). He describes a
fire that breaks out, destroying part of the manuscript that the
biographer uses as source material:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Often the paper was scorched a deep brown in the middle of the most
important sentence. Just when we thought to elucidate a secret that
has puzzled historians for a hundred years, there was a hole in the
manuscript big enough to put your finger through. We have done our
best to piece out a meagre summary from the charred fragments that
remain; but often it has been necessary to speculate, to surmise, and
even to use the imagination. 88
#+END_QUOTE
The biographer explains that he must work from fragments, and as a
result, must draw from speculation. 

Throughout the story, the question of gender is closely coordinated
with the imagination. One scene from the first chapter, when Orlando
is still a young man, demonstrates the power of the imagination with
regard to gender presentation. In this scene, Orlando first sees
Sasha, a Russian Princess, skating on the frozen-over river
Thames. From her androgynous appearence, skilled atheleticism, and
exotic manner of dress, he cannot tell if Sasha is a man or a woman: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
He beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him
with the highest curiosity. The person, whatever the name or sex, was
about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed entirely in
oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar greenish-coloured
fur. But these details were obscured by the extraordinary
seductiveness which issued from the whole person. Images, metaphors of
the most extreme and extravagant twined and twisted in his mind. He
called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an emerald, and a fox
in the snow all in the space of three seconds; he did not know whether
he had heard her, tasted her, seen her, or all three together. (For
though we must pause not a moment in the narrative we may here hastily
note that all his images at this time were simple in the extreme to
match his senses and were mostly taken from things he had liked the
taste of as a boy. But if his senses were simple they were at the same
time extremely strong. To pause therefore and seek the reasons of
things is out of the question.)... A melon, an emerald, a fox in the
snow--so he raved, so he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must
be--no woman could skate with such speed and vigour--swept almost on
tiptoe past him, Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that
the person was of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the
question. But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a
boy's, but no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those
breasts; no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from
the bottom of the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping a
curtsey with the utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past on
the arm of some Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a
standstill. She was not a handsbreadth off. She was a woman. 27-28
#+END_QUOTE
Orlando's difficulty of discovering Sasha's gender blends into his
difficulty with language: "a figure, which, whether boy's or
woman's... served to disguise the sex"; "He called her a melon, a
pineapple, an olive tree, an emerald". As the person's probable gender
oscillates throughout passage, Orlando's desire crescendos: "Orlando
was ready to tear his hair with vexation that the person was of his
own sex". 

Similarly to the narrator, then, Orlando also undergoes a struggle
with language's ability to convey objective truth. His struggle with
describing Sasha also lends to his developing poetic sensibility,
where Orlando takes particular issue with the potential for language
to signify real-world referents. Thus he attempts to describe the
color of the grass and the sky:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
'The sky is blue,' he said, 'the grass is green.' Looking up, he saw
that, on the contrary, the sky is like the veils which a thousand
Madonnas have let fall from their hair; and the grass fleets and
darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs
from enchanted woods. 'Upon my word,' he said (for he had fallen into
the bad habit of speaking aloud), 'I don't see that one's more true
than another. Both are utterly false.' And he despaired of being able
to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into
a deep dejection. 75
#+END_QUOTE
Orlando cannot comprehend whether plain english (“the sky is blue; the
grass is green”) is preferable to figurative language (“she sky is
like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall from their
hair; the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the
embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods”). For Orlando, both
seem false. 

As Orlando undergoes a sex change and falls in love, his issues with
language begin to resolve. In a scene that evokes the prior one on the
grass, Orlando is in Hyde Park, watching a toy boat negotiate a
wavelet on the Serpentine river. Momentarily, the boat is dissapears
then re-emerges on the other side of the wavelet. Orlando associates
this moment with the word “ecstasy”, and hurries to telegram the
phrase, ‘a toy boat on the serpentine’ and ‘ecstasy’, to her lover,
who she knows will immediately understand what it means. As she
hurries to the post office, she meditates on the nature of language
and literature, which she now realizes is violently ecstatic.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,' she repeated, thus enforcing upon
herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor
eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter; it's
something useless, sudden, violent; something that costs a life; red,
blue, purple; a spirit; a splash; like those hyacinths (she was passing a
fine bed of them); free from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or
care for one's kind; something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth,
husband I mean, Bonthrop: that's what it is--a toy boat on the
Serpentine, ecstasy--it's ecstasy that matters. 
#+END_QUOTE
Unlike the grass and sky from the previous scene, language now has the
power to signify. "A toy boat" and "ecstasy" are reduced to the same
meaning, a common denominator of feeling. This reduction elevates the
potential for language to capture and convey meaning. The symmetry of
these two episodes shows how Orlando moves beyond a disappointment in
the limitations of language for expression to a new faith in its power
to mean.

As Orlando resolves her struggle with language, so does the
biographer. Increasingly, the biographer drops this pretension toward
accuracy and boldly speculates, without excuses, elements of the
story. At one point, the biographer draws the reader into this
speculation. At this moment, Orlando mets her lover, Shel, a ship
captain who exhibits as many feminine qualities as Orlando does
masculine. The biographer describes a scene of their early courtship:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'Shel, my darling,' she began again, 'tell me...' and so they talked
two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and really it
would profit little to write down what they said, for they knew each
other so well that they could say anything, which is tantamount to
saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things as how to cook an
omelette, or where to buy the best boots in London, things which have
no lustre taken from their setting, yet are positively of amazing
beauty within it. For it has come about, by the wise economy of
nature, that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language; the
commonest expressions do, since no expressions do; hence the most
ordinary conversation is often the most poetic, and the most poetic is
precisely that which cannot be written down. For which reasons we
leave a great blank here, which must be taken to indicate that the
space is filled to repletion.
#+END_QUOTE
The biographer here explains that this conversation would come across
as extremely ordinary and boring to the reader, although it was
actually beautiful and poetic when it took place. An ordinary
conversation can be poetic at the moment of expression, delivered or
said in a way that is beautiful, which may then lose in language. The
reader then encounters a space break which the biographer instructs
her to imagine is "filled to repletion." This space break reinvokes
the episode with the manuscript, where the biographer points out that
there are holes or gaps in the record. However, while it was
previously a problem with evidence, now it is a problem with
language. According to the biographer, the means to express this
conversation doesn’t exist in language. As a result, the biographer
invites the reader to fill in the space. To use speculation and
guesses as to what happened. The reader must do what the biographer
did when he confronted the lack of evidence, which was to guess what
happens from the available evidence.

Comparing the biographer and Orlando's experiences with language
surface an interesting insight: imagination works to both reduce and
elevate language. In one case, the word "ecstasy" is endowned with
powerful meaning, or the ability to mean. In the other, words in fact
lose their ability to convey, so the language of absence take their
place. But the critical move amounts to the same. Both assert the
reader's role in constructing meaning. Words have the power to
signify, but not in themselves, inert and sterile on the page. They
require the imagination from the reader. 

In troubling the line between objective reality and subjective
experience, Woolf’s parodic biography explores how language and gender
are similarly (and coordinately) constructed. This development in
language both within the story and on the level of narration is
coordinated with Orlando's gender development. Orlando's struggle with
the ability of words to mean and the biographer's struggle to tell a
story of a life, begins to resolve after the gender change. The
difficulty with language that Orlando and the biographer both
experience becomes less and less of an issue as Orlando comes into her
femininity, which is to say, becomes comfortable in herself. These
changes are possible because the narrative embraces the influence of
the imaginary in language, in minding meaning in words and in
storytelling. This allows Orlando to accept the role of the
imagination in gender, in making gender meaningful.

I will use text analysis to further explore the relationship between
these themes: language, gender, and the imagination. So the question
then becomes: how are language and gender co-constructed in Orlando?
What is the role of the imagination in gender/language? What is the
relation between gender, language, and the imagination? 


** Deformance and Performance
how dh methods descendant from textual scholarship offer a model of
deformance that can incorporate key ideas from queer theory, like
citationality/resignification, to do distant reading. The process of
regularization is analogous to the significatory structures of
performativity. 

This section critiques digital methods by posing computation, where
textual data is cleaned, structured, and normalized for electronic
processing, against the complexity of queer subjecthood expressed in
textual style, form, and voice.

*** harnessing human attention 
Underwood's focus on the "distant horizon" of literary history blocks
out the ways that quantitative literary analysis, or distant reading,
works in coordination with existing human capacities. According to
Underwood, distant reading is less useful for studying a single text
in depth and more useful for taking a long view of larger corpora. He
sets up an opposition between computer and human reading:
"Computational analysis of a text is more flexible than it used to be,
but it is still quite crude compared to human reading; it helps mainly
with questions where evidence is simply too big to fit in a single
reader's memory" (xxi). He is right to point out that a computer
cannot (yet) process nuance like a human can, and that a human cannot
recognize letters and words at the same speed as a computer. Yet, his
emphasis on the limitations of human memory suggests another way that
that computers can guide and enhance the human reading of smaller
texts. What the computer properly does is arrange a set of data--of
any size--for human consumption. This involves processing datasets
into new forms and configurations that can then be scrutinzed by a
human reader. Although Underwood uses distant reading to "to find a
perspective that makes... scholars all congruent with each other,"
quantitative methods can supplement human memory by approaching
memory, specifically working memory, as a resource, rather than a
hindrance (/Distant Horizons/ 32). The computer can re-arrange text in
a way that focuses the attention span of the reader on elements
previously unseen or overlooked.

*** McGann: quantum poetics & deformance
Now we shift our attention to a body of literary criticism that offers
another perspective for handling textual data. The field of textual
scholarship, and particularly the editorial practice of deformance,
opens up a way of thinking about data that is performative rather than
representative. Critics like Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode take an approach toward text that resists the
conservatism of traditional textual scholarship, which has generally
aimed for the recovery and preservation of the ideal text. Rather than
pursue recovery, these textual scholars explore new ways of reading
our textual inheritance that creates new possibilities for discovery
and speculation. Their methodology opens a space for key ideas in
queer theory about how to work within (and resist) the constraints of
language as a significatory system. This is about working within a
system to transcend the determining structure of that system.

Like books, digital media is also limited, but it holds potential for
the way it displays information. The technical experience of editing
electronic texts encourages the speculation on new potentialities
about its presentation. McGann introduces the term “quantum poetics”
to indicate the volatile potentiality for meaning contained in every
element of a literary text. He explains that, “Aesthetic space is
organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements
making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even reverse
themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete quantum
levels” (McGann 2001, 183). The meaning of particular words in a
literary text depends upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent
readings and pathways through that text, to the significance of
immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces, all of which
the reader can only process a limited amount. In its potentiality,
McGann asserts, “Every page, even a blank page... is n-dimensional”
(2001, 184). Accordingly, digital tools could expose literature’s
inherent potentialities by carving new paths across familiar texts. In
this way, McGann argues for tools that facilitate tactile and
intuitive engagements of texts within an environment that opens itself
up to multiple dimensions of reading.

This radical potentiality of a text's quantum poetics is a result of
the limitation of digital media, which creates a tranformation upon
literary material into a new form. McGann's work thus takes the
limitations of computation--the fixing and disambiguation of data--and
turns it into a vehicle for analyzing literary material. He, along
with Lisa Samuels, describe literary interpretation as performance, or
what they call "deformance." Deformance works by estranging the reader
from her familiarity of the text, and relies on the the volitality of
meaning of particular words that depend upon a multitude of factors,
from antecedent readings and pathways through that text, to the
significance of immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces,
all of which the reader can only process a limited amount. A
"deformative criticism" therefore distorts, disorders, or re-assembles
literary texts to discover new insights about its formal significance
and meaning. McGann and Samuels offer the example of reading a poem
backward, where “the critical and interpretive question is not 'What
does the poem mean?' but 'How do we release or expose this poem’s
possibilities for meaning?'" (2001, 108).
*** Bode: the tool creates cuts in data

I now turn to the work of Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement, both of
whom have deep investments with traditions of textual scholarship,
particularly the scholarship of Jerome McGann, that has influenced
early experiments with digital humanities in English
departments. Although their approaches vary in their specific topics,
methods, and results, they are connected in an investment for, in the
words of McGann, "imagining what we don't know" (82).

Building off the humanistic approaches in textual scholarship and
bibliography, Bode reframes literary analysis as performative. Bode
incorporates insights from Karen Barad's feminist scientific
methodology to argue against representationalism, or "the idea that a
knowing human agent symbolically expresses – or represents – some
thing-in-the-world (that thing is unchanged by that expression, and
that expression is more available or apprehensible to the subject than
the thing itself) ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 2). Barad's work
intervenes in theoretical physics to argue how the researcher is
always implicated in the object of study, and she proposes a theory of
"agential realism," where objects in the world do not precede their
interaction, but rather, 'objects' emerge through particular
"intra-actions" (Barad 58). Bode brings Barad's point about the
assumption of representation from physics to computational modelling,
where she explains that "entities don’t pre-exist engagements but are
generated in an ongoing or emergent way, by those intra-actions"
("Data Beyond Represenation" par. 2). For Bode, what statisticians
value as “representativeness” or “reproducibility” isn’t as important
(within a humanities context) as the materiality of the
apparatus. Rather than attempt to secure a factual or objective status
of the data, we should double down on the material processes of using
our tools. Accordingly, Bode suggests that we approach literary
databases in performative terms, taking a self-conscious appraisal of
the tools of analysis, as "effects of material-semiotic engagements"
("Data Beyond Representation" par. 15).

In troubling the subject/object boundary, examining "how... we
inscribe the boundaries we often presume to represent," Bode offers an
example with her current project, /Reading at the Interface/, which
explores the ways that Australian literature has been characterized by
various "paratexts," or "writings about literature."  ("Data Beyond
Representation par 11.) The project explores paratexts across various
platforms, including academic journals, newspapers, /Goodreads/, and
/Librarything/, to see how they have represented the boundary of
"Australian Literature." Bode looks at how the process of data
collection makes a distinction between the main text and the
"paratext," or the metadata like title, author, and publication
information of the text. She is interested in how her inquiry
literally creates boundaries of what we understand to be "text" and
"paratext" in Australian literature. This activity indicates, for
Bode, how the researcher is intevening with the object of
analysis. Bode that she's "not interested in representing discussion
of “Australian literature” on Goodreads so much as in materialising
that platform in ways that cannot be separated from [her] categories
of analysis" ("Data Beyond Representation" par. 19). Her research
finds that an attention to the "apparatus," or the instrument of
analysis, is crucial in exploring the performative aspects of
inquiry. Drawing from a physics understanding, where "an apparatus is
a specific material configuration, including of physicists, wherein
certain properties become determinate, while others are excluded,"
Bode applies the figure of the apparatus to literary databases (Bode
"Data Beyond Representation, par. 24). Instead of looking at what is
being reproduced, she urges literary researchers to look at how human
engagement has entangled with and created the object of analysis.
 
*** Clement: abstraction and human attention

Tanya Clement's work with sound incorporates praxis, visualization,
embodiment, and play toward a theory of performantive criticism. She
uses figures and methods from audio analysis to reconsider the ways we
approach digitized text. In a project on text visualization, she puts
forth a theory of “play,” in which the critic "performs" the work,
much like the way that musicians interpret a musical score. She uses
the audio analysis tool "ProseVis" to visualize the prosodic elements
of Gertrude Stein's poetry, which creates dynamic spaces for the
reader to interact with the visualization. Using ProseVis, the reader
can navigate through the visualizations and manipulate the metrics for
analysis. Clement makes the analogy between musical scores and
quantitative visualizations to emphasize how both "create another
level of abstraction with which the interpreter engages" ("Distant
Listening par. 7). Clement points out that a musical score "is read,
but it is also meant to be played, to be spatialized in time and
embodied by voices (or instruments) within a certain physical and
hermeneutical context" ("Distant Listening" par. 10). She argues that
the same is true for visualizations of text: "One 'reads' a
visualization, but to 'play' the visualisation is to engage the
spatialized interpretation of that visualisation as an embodied reader
in a situated context within a specific hermeneutical framework
("Distant Listening" par. 10). The multiple levels of abstraction for
containing the "work" of the text multiply the levels of engagement
with that text. Clement's research takes this key finding from textual
scholarship and applies it to the critical process.

The unique affordance of digital environments, according to McGann,
Bode and Clement, is that they allow for numerable interventions upon
the textual object. Like a musical score, which "point[s] toward many
possible interpretive 'results' or readings," visualizaions can
provide a starting ground for different pathways of analysis ("Distant
Listening" par. 12). Human attention spans, rather than represent the
hurdle for computational methods to overcome, offer an opportunity for
re-imagining analysis as a process of deforming what we pay attention
to. The emphasis shifts from viewing text as something stable and
self-evident to something dynamic and subject to different
readings. As McGann speculates, engaging with texts on a computer
could be as intimate a process as engaging with them on paper. We
might use digital tools as “prosthetic extension of that demand for
critical reflection,” with which the reader is able to feel her way
through the text (18).

*** TODO NLTK cleaning and regularization
[how text analysis deforms text through cleaning and normalization,
which subscribe it to regulative structures]

*** queer performance & citationality 
Distant reading can evolve by borrowing from key findings from queer
theory that allow it to embrace the performative/productive aspects of
quantification. In particular, Butler's idea of gender performativity
coheres with deformative reading. Butler describes performativity as a
repetative activity, constrained by regulatory norms, which produces
subjects. Although performativity regulates subjects toward
heteronormative practices, it can also be coopted into subversion. In
the process of repetition, subjects have the possibility of
resignifying meaning by producing it differently. This resignification
allows subjects to work within their limitations to resist dominant
structures while maintaining their own sense of exclusion without
being coopted. In other words, they can be in the system but not of
the system.

In her groundbreaking book, /Gender Trouble: Feminism and the
Subversion of Identity/ (1990), Judith Butler famously disrupts
contemporary feminist theorizations about sex and gender; namely, that
sex is biological while gender is constructed; and that the gender, as
a construction, is an expression of the subject. According to Butler,
there is no such thing as a stable gender identity, or even a subject
that exists prior to gender expression. Rather, Butler argues that
gender is a performance--a series of repeated acts by which the
subject, in the ongoing enactment of gender expression according to
heteronormative regulatory schemas, emerges. Major criticism of this
work resists the idea that both sex and gender are discursively
produced, insisting upon the physicality of the sexed body as a basis
of identity. In /Bodies That Matter/ (1995), Butler responds to this
criticism by delineating the process of performativity, where what is
experienced as the physical body, its boundaries and its sexuality,
only materialize through the repetition or “citation” of cultural
norms. Her concept of "citation" emphasizes the iterability of the
performative practice, whereby each action "cites" or implicitly
signals an authorizing norm. According to Butler, performance consists
of this habit of citation, the ongoing process of submitting behavior
to a regulatory norm. Butler makes the general argument that body’s
materiality is discursive, that the “sexed body” is a residue or
"sentimentation" that emerges from the signification and
re-signification of whatever social power or understanding about sex.

In /Bodies that Matter/, Butler's central concern is to explore how
language and the body engage. She approaches this concern by
identifying the issue with representation: "Can language simply refer
to materiality, or is language also the very condition under which
materiality may be said to appear?" (6). Specifically, Butler wonders
whether language can indicate a body that has not yet been imbued with
meaning, a body "prior to signification" (6). She finds that language
cannot--for to refer to the body, language must first posit that body,
and in the positing, it assumes meaning. Therefore, the signification
of the body actually creates the body: "This signification produces as
an /effect/ of its own procedure the very body that it nevertheless
and simultaneously claims to discover as that which /precedes/ its own
action" (6). Butler thus claims that language works to /produce/
signification, rather than reflect a prior reality: "the mimetic or
representational status of language, which claims that signs follow
bodies as their necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the
contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue
performative" (6). Language cannot simply point to a reality, for in
the act of pointing, language actually produces that reality. So, in
the process of citation, which is the ongoing re-signification that
appeals to regulatory norms, subjects are always interpellated by a
discourse prior to their citing it: they cannot speak outside the
power that structures speech. However, in settling the issue of
language and representation, Butler isolates a productive quality of
language, which will be central to the ways that language offers a way
out of the significatory circle.

Amid this regulatory structure, however, lies the possibility of
resignifying sex/gender. Butler insists that resignification of these
citations is the way out of this significatory circle. Butler asks,
"What would it mean to cite a law to produce it differently, to 'cite'
the law in order to reiterate and coopt its power?" (xxiii). Because
language transcends a representative function, because it has the
ability to /produce/ meaning, language can be resignified toward
subversive usages. Butler offers an example in the resignification of
the term "queer," which has been transformed from a term of abjection
to one of empowerment. She explains that, every time an identification
is made, so is a repudiation, and "this disavowed abjection will
threaten to expose the self-grounding presumptions of the sexed
subject" (3). In identifying with heterosexuality, one repudiates
homosexuality, and homosexuality, in turn, remains a threat to the
identification. Butler proposes that one marshall this repudiation as
a resource in resignification: "The task will be to consider this
threat and disruption... as a critical resource in the struggle to
articulate the very terms of symbolic legitimacy and intelligibility"
(3). She explains that one recognizes this resignification in the word
“queer” which has been re-appropriated from signifying abjectness to
defiance. The term "queer," in its public assertion, "enacts
performativity as citationality for the purposes of resignifying the
abjection of homosexuality into defiance and legitimacy"
(xxviii). Each time the term is used, it draws from the domain of
abjection, the repudiation, in a way that re-signifies because it
fails to repeat the meaning loyally, because it signifies that meaning
differently. Repetition of the term to re-signify identification, to
the point where it loses its power. This is especially evident in
drag, where "the refusal of the law might be produced in the form of
the parodic inhabiting of conformity that subtly calls into question
the legitimacy of the command, a repetition of the law into hyperbole"
(82). For Butler, then, the central problem of being stuck in
performance is also the solution. Butler takes on language as
something that can be productive, that can resignify meaning, as the
option available to those who are trapped within the signification
system.

*** example of performative citation with Irigaray
An exploration of Luce Irigaray writing style demonstrates how this
process of resignification can take place in language. According to
Butler, Irigaray's main task is to explore what has been excluded by
philosophy, which is the feminine. Irigaray uses the concept of
phallogocentrism, or that man, symbolized by the phallus, is the
center and focus of knowledge, as a lens for reading Plato and
Aristotle's discussion of form/matter or bodies/souls
binaries. Irigaray demonstrates how these binaries, which take the
category of "woman," associated with "matter" (materiality, the
mother) and set it subordinate to male "form" (mastering rationality)
actually erase the possibility of representing woman at all. In fact,
the binary that claims to represent the feminine as the subordinated
term in masculine/feminine binaries, actually "produces the feminine
as that which must be excluded for that economy to operate"
(10). Because "binary oppositions are formulated through the exclusion
of a field of disruptive possibilities"(10), the feminine is
"domesticated" (13). The nonfigured feminine remains excessive,
outside the terms of the binary:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
One cannot interpret the philosophical relation to the feminine
through the figures that philosophy provides, but, rather, she argues,
through siting the feminine as the unspeakable condition of
figuration, as that which, in fact, can never be figured within the
terms of philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is
its enabling condition. 12
#+END_QUOTE
What Butler calls the /excessive/ feminine is excluded, or cast out,
as "the necessary outside," which allows the /specular/ feminine to
take its place in the binary. According to Butler, we cannot know what
the feminine consists of without subscribing it to
phallogocentrism. If the feminine is outside the system, and cannot be
figured, how can it be known? Butler aptly questions, "For how can one
read a text for what does /not/ appear within its own terms, but which
nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own
legibility?" (11). For Butler, this is the key question--how do we
work with what we are given to express what is not there, what is
refused by the system of the visible?

The answer is through repetition and reworking--resignification
through performative citation. Butler explains that Irigaray achieves
this resignification by miming language: "she mimes philosophy... and,
in the mime, takes on a language that effectively cannot belong to
her" (12). Butler reads Irigaray's use citation as a strategy of
repeating what Plato says with the goal of undermining his authority:
"She cites Plato again and again, but the citations expose precisely
what is excluded from them, and seek to show and to reintroduce the
excluded into the system itself" (18). Through repetition, Irigaray
displaces the logic of phallogocentrism, introducing something
external to the system while remaining within its terminology. Butler
affirms that "Her miming has the effect of repeating the origin only
to displace that origin as an origin" (18). Her repetition is a way of
infiltrating the logic of phallogocentrism on its own terms. Butler
herself mimes what might have been Irigaray's internal monologue:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be a poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you
nevertheless by miming the textual passages through which you
construct your system and showing that what cannot enter it is already
inside it (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside within
the system calls into question its systematic closure and its
pretension to be self-grounding" (18).
#+END_QUOTE
Deception through resemblance; insubordination through subservience;
displacement through repetition--these are the tools available to the
subject that remains outside the logic of phallogocentrism.

*** preserving the unintelligible
For Butler and Irigaray, however, "radical and inclusive
representability is not precisely the goal" (25). Remaining /outside/
the logic of phallogocentrism is necessary for preserving the content
of the excluded feminine from being coopted into that logic. Butler,
in particular, hopes for a queer subjectivity that can never be
defined, and like the term "queer," for it "to remain that which is,
in the present, never fully owned, but always and only redeployed,
twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and
expanding political purposes" (173). Through performative citation,
Butler intends to preserve that which is excluded or unintelligible as
a resource for continual resignification, as "the point of departure
for a set of historical reflections and futural imaginings"
(173). For, Butler explains that, "to bring in every marginal and
excluded position within a given discourse is to claim that a singular
discourse meets its limits nowhere, that it can and will domesticate
all signs of difference" (25). Rather than aim for inclusion, one
ought to position the "necessary outside" as a target that is beyond
reach, as a fount for future subversions. This positioning allows us
to harness opacity and unintelligibility as a resource for resisting
the "violence of this exclusion," using unrepresentability as a tool
for disruption. Only this language of performative citation can
illuminate the structure of the signifying power without also giving
that power the tool to fight that which is questioning its
authority. Butler explains that, "If there is a violence necessary to
the language of politics, then the risk of that violation might well
be followed by another in which we begin, without ending, without
mastering, to own—-and yet never fully to own—-the exclusions by which
we proceed."  (25).


** Queer Distant Reading
An iterative method of distant reading attends to gender as an
iterative practice. We find ever expanding ways that gender is
characterized in /Orlando/. 

Computational methods reveal an aesthetic of formalization as an
heuristic: just as text is transformed and manipulated into data, so
queerness is formalized into narrative and figurative
structures. Approaching queerness and computation as an aesthetic of
formalization opens a space where the rigidity of computational
methods and the fluidity of queer subjectivity intersect.

*** bode and butler parallel on language productivity
The way that Bode describes her critical approach mirrors Butler's
explanation of the performative. Bode is drawing a distinction between
two approaches for literary criticism, two options for engaging with
literary material and phenomena. The first is "representationalist,"
in which data represents or expresses real objects and subjects in the
world. The second approach understands data "as part of the ongoing
materialisation of literary texts, as emerging events always arising
from an altering how the literary past as reconfigured" (Bode
"Computational Modeling: From Data Representation to Performative
Materiality"). Similarly, Butler distinguishes a representationalist
approach toward language and materiality, in which language can
/refer/ to materiality as something that is prior, against the
performative approach, by which language works through repetition to
signify and resignify meaning:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary
mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive,
constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this
signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to
find prior to any and all signifcation. Butler 6
#+END_QUOTE
The alignment here between Bode and Butler indicates an intersection
between queer and digital processes, which center on the role of
language and data in conveying meaning. There is something
fundamentally productive about these phenomena, and not in the way
that they purport to represent some real quality or object in the
world. Rather, the productive aspect has to do with how they iterate
their material over and again in ways that are fundamentally creative.

*** reproducibility reduces data
Reproducibility flattens data into reduced forms which perpetuate
themselves. In the section on reproducibility, I discuss how
Underwood's analysis on gender differences reproduces his assumptions
about gender dynamics as oppositional, as he readily admits: "this
chapter has discovered stable 'structural positions' only because it
explores gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition" (/Distant
Horizons/ 140). The the binary structure reproduces itself from the
initial assumptions to the result. Like the fantasy of the
falsifiable, the romance of reproducibility arises from a desire to
find coherence across literary history, and thus aims for a method
that can do so by abstracting text as data to surface connections
between them. Because reproducibility aims for what Underwood
describes as a "simple picture," it collapses or flattens the
complexity of data into workable units ("Machine Learning" 98). He
reproduces his own assumption in the output. The issue then becomes,
how can we might move beyond reproducing assumptions in our analysis?

*** shifting to the speculative
One answer is to shift the objective of analysis from the the
reproducible to the speculative. My intervention lies in teasing out
how existing paradigms for analyzing literary data and power
structures might combine to create a new method for text analyis. This
new method grapples with quantification that reduces or flattens data
by harnessing this reduction toward speculative ends. First, the field
of Textual Scholarship, which explores how electronic environments
faciliate the continued study of literary materials, offers Deformance
as an analytical method. This method attends to the ways that digital
environments for editorial scholarship transform the object of study
to surface new material for analysis. Second, the field of Queer
Studies offers the theory of Performativity, which is not a critical
method of analysis, but a paradigm for understanding how subjects
navigate compulsory significatory systems. The theory of Performance
posits that subjectivity emerges by subscribing to--or
"citing"--regulatory norms of behavior, like gender roles, and also
proposes that citational practices open the possibility for subversion
to norms through resignification. Despite their differences, both
deformance and performance rely on the ability for language to
resignifiy meaning through deconstruction and iterability. Both pay
attention to the productive qualities of language, which can be
redeployed toward creativity, rather than perpetuate "representations"
which obscure their significatory power by miming some prior citation.

While digital tools like text analysis transform elements of gender
and sexuality into formalized data in ways that reduce or flatten
their complexity, this reduction actually opens up the possibilities
for using these tools to interpret elements of gender and sexuality in
text.

*** TODO Python, iteration, NLTK

Many distant reading projects use a tool called Python to do
computational analysis. Python is a general purpose programming
language applicable toward many tasks and projects, from publishing
websites, to managing and analyzing large data sets (both textual and
numeric data), to deep learning and artificial intelligence. The
emphasis on readability in Python's code vocabulary and syntax make it
a relatively straightforward programming language which is easier to
pick up than other comparable languages. Most beginners can jump into
the python syntax and intuit a sense of the code simply by reading it
left to right. For example, an expression called the ~for loop~
consists of six words over two lines, and that instructs Python to do
something to each item in a group of data. In more technical terms,
the ~for loop~ offers a mechanism for iterating (or "looping") through
data, and carrying out some specified action to each peice of
data. The ~for loop~ consists of the following expression:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
#+END_SOURCE

The first line of code specificies the data (~"hello"~), and the
second line (~print(letter)~) instructs the computer to print each
letter in the word. Essentially, this loop will go through each item
in the data, in this case, each letter in the word "hello," and it
will "print" or display that data.[fn:13] The the output will appear
thus:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
h
e
l
l
o
#+END_SOURCE

These kinds of iterative computations, which are central to
programming tasks, are a core component of working with text. At a
very basic level, much of text analysis consists of iterating over
bits of text and doing something to each bit. 

A major benefit to a programming language like Python, which is very
popular, is that users have developed a number of Python "libraries,"
or collections of code, which are tailor-made for specific tasks. For
example, there are Python libraries for common tasks tasks like
statistical modelling, web scraping, and data analysis and
visualization, for working with different kinds of data, like text,
numeric, visual, and audio data.
*** TODO Man and Woman in Orlando

(Make a model of the words associated with man and woman, then find a
way to analyze these associated words further. We are "resignifying"
the terms man and woman to mean differently, according to the existing
structures of the text. We use a process that is iterative,
computational text analysis, to yield novel results; we embrace the
status of gender as iteratively produced in language, even before
there is a subject)

Turning back to Woolf's /Orlando/, we ask how the genders "woman" and
"man" are constructed? In looking at these gender categories, we will
explore how they are related to one another.

*** TODO modeling gender distinctiveness

We begin by exploring the similarities of the words "man" and woman"
in the python programming language. Using the Natural Language Toolkit
(NLTK), a text processing library in python, we begin by running the
method "similar" on "man" and "woman."[fn:14] This method takes a word, such
as "man," and returns the top 20 words that most appear associated
with that word in the text. The similarity is computed by processing
the words that directly surround the given word, which is known as its
"context." From this context, similarity then counts which of these
words are most frequent. It then returns the 20 most frequent terms. 

Below is an image of the similarity of the following words, "woman" and
"man": 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
> orl.similar("woman")
man moment night boy word world child pen ship door one room window
light little lady table book queen king

>orl.similar("man")
woman word lady moment night boy poet little sight time one house
window life table thought tree queen world truth
#+END_QUOTE

Interestingly, the most frequent word associated with each term is the
other gender: "man" is most associated with "woman," and "woman" is
most associated with "man." 

We see how man and woman are also closely associated by the shared
terms in the list, which include: "moment," "night," "word," "lady,"
"boy," "little," "world," "window," "table," "queen," "one"--11 of the
remaining 19 words. Words that remain unique to woman include: "child
pen ship door room light book king"; and words that remain unique to
"man" include: "poet sight time house life thought tree truth."

These words will be our starting place for differentiating between man
and woman in the text. 

Let's put these distinct words into a new list, one for "woman," and
one for "man."
	  
*** TODO iterating over code resignifies it
Each time we process a text in computation, we are submitting it to
the governing code, a code that flattens the object, abstracting it,
only computing part of it. But if we run the computation over and over
again, we are resignifying the terms. 

	  See code from NLTK or Voyant, generate()?

    Code as "protocol" - working through established networks 
    Code as "citationality" - repeating code to attain agency

    Butler is looking for the “exploit”, the way out of the
    system by using the system’s own rules. Using language and repetition
    to resignify what sexuality and proper sexual relations are.

    "The compulsion to repeat an injury is not necessarily the compulsion
    to repeat the injury in the same way or to stay fully within the
    traumatic orbit of that injury. The force of repetition in language
    may be the paradoxical condition by which a certain agency---not
    linked to a fiction of the ego as master of circumstance---is derived
    from the impossibility of choice… Paris is Burning might be understood
    as repetitions of hegemonic forms of power that fail to repeat loyally
    and, in that failure, open possibilities for resignifying the terms of
    violation against their violating aims" (83).

*** TODO Findings: new configurations of gender

What do we find in Orlando? That man and woman are actually very
similar? Yes and no.

how does this finding change what we know about the text?

*** TODO the power of the imagination

    The process reveals the hidden "enabling structures" of our
    analysis: our analytical method, and the structures by which we
    understand queerness (categories).

    This notion of displacement through repetition is applied back to
    text analysis to illustrate how the iterative process of analyzing
    text can surface new textual structures that re-signify certain
    elements of that text.

*** TODO Conclusion: performatiave citation queers distant reading: 
    Deception through resemblance; insubordination through
    subservience; displacement through repetition--these are the tools
    available to the subject that remains outside the logic of
    phallogocentrism.

    Reading for the enabling structures, and then playing with these
    structures by repeating the same processes over them. Iteration,
    interaction, creating new results are important. We are reading
    for that which is hidden, surpressed, which determines that which
    is visible.

This deformance is an iterative process. 

There's a dip in the word "don't" toward the end of the novel, in

Turns out, there's a little spike in "don't"s in the middle of chapter

explains why there's a dip in the graph on the general text, and an
uptick in the graph that isolates don'ts from the general text.

This activity calls for closer attention to the area of the spike, and

*** Altschuler and Weimar on reproducibility

--> reproducing something perfectly overlooks the ways that all
digital objects are unique, differentiated. Theory of textual
criticism which shows how ther are more interesting things to do then
create a digital "copy texte". 

This notion extends to digital humanist practitioners. 

they call to overturn the "unproblematic translatability of
information between the senses" while maintaining that reproduction is
the highest value. They argue to "texture the humanities", pointing
out that much of DH prioritizes the visual over other senses --
"privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible"
(74). Rightly so, they argue, “The textured DH we call for here
acknowledges that we cannot study knowledge only abstractly, apart
from the senses, and that we cannot study literature, art, and history
without including the history of embodied experiences” (74-75).
- “Touch This Page! uses 3-D printed facsimiles of raised-letter text
  to inspire reflection on the assumptions most people make about
  which senses are involved in reading” (82).

But they elide the one interesting trajectory when they place
reproduction over remediation/deformance. They state their aims: “to
expand the sensory accessibility of archives for all users and to do
so through the digital reproduction---rather than the translation---of
tactile knowledge” (76). Case example of the perfect reproduction:
- A scenario where “users... can download a visual copy with
descriptive data, engage with the text in virtual reality, and create
their own textured facsimile. This technology once more makes possible
the tactile reading experiences for which this volume was designed and
promises library patrons a richer engagement with touch than most
archives can currently provide---even in person (85-86). 

The use case scenario makes the assumption that a reproduction is the
ideal form of textuality, despite their asserted aims for "diversity
of embodied experiences":
- “we must avoid tilting after the fiction of some ideal digital
  surrogate---like a virtual reality system that would flawlessly
  mimic original objects---lest we become digital Pierre Menards,
  expending extensive energy to improve our reproductions to discover,
  at last, that only the original perfects represents itself… Instead,
  we envision in our tactile futures multiple strategies that could
  not only open up access to varied experiences---past and
  present---but also diversity the ways embodied experiences structure
  our digital worlds” (86).
- in order to open up “multiple strategies” and diversity embodied
  experiences, we need a theory of text that is capacious enough to
  accept variation and transmediation.
- This argument overlooks deformance is a solution: the ways that
  creating new texts, paratexts, creates new objects of knowledge. It
  overlooks the performative, ala McGann, Clement.

In this view, digital becomes a means of optimization, efficiency,
total knowledge and understanding.

*** The debates about TEI illustrates this tension between the
“conservative” and the “creative” impulses in textual editing, and
shows how an encoding method that is highly structured can be used to
mark or explore moments of textual instability or ambiguity.

*** felski on affects beside suspicion



Postcritical Reading…  “in this sense, is not just a cognitive
activity but an embodied mode of attentiveness that involves us in
acts of sensing, perceiving, feeling, registering, and engaging”
(Felski 176). 

Felski: At stake is our receptivity: “to allow ourselves to be marked,
struck, impressed by what we read” (Felski 12). 

"the reader-text connection becomes part of a network rather than a
self-enclosed dyad— yet a connection that remains vital to literary
studies, especially in the classroom. Reading, in this light, is a
matter of attaching, collating, negotiating, assembling—of forging
links between things that were previously unconnected. It is not a
question of plumbing depths or tracing surfaces… Interpretation
becomes a coproduction between actors that brings new things to light
rather than an endless rumination on a text’s hidden meanings or
representational failures” (Felski 174)

Surface reading challenges that search for absence by compelling a
reader to stay with what the text says and how it says it rather than
moving ahead to probe how it reflects and refracts larger cultural
patterns. This critique reifies aesthetic objects and suggests that
literary critics should embrace the literary.

*** mcpherson, benjamin on race and tech
Major developments in technology also perpetuate racial
assumptions. Moving from networking technologies to software
development, Tara McPherson explores the parallels between the
Operating Systems and race relations, to show how the development of
computer software betrays hegemonic assumptions about whiteness and
elisions of difference.[fn:15] She focuses on the key moment of 1960s
United States, when Operating Systems, which is the foundational
software that supports a computer's programs and basic functioning,
developed alongside civil rights discourses. Her research focuses on
how "the organization of information and capital" in OS development
resonates in the struggles for racial justice: "Many of these shifts
were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
radicalism" (30). McPherson deconstructs the UNIX operating system
which includes a hierarchical file system, a command line interpreter
(the Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), and a variety of
software programs that are designed to work in tandem. McPherson
points out that UNIX-based Operating Systems (like Mac and Linux) are
distinguished by the ways that they partition and simplify complex
processes into discrete components, similar to the ways that identity
politics cordones off parts of the (social and technological) system
into distinct units. While this cordoning was productive for the
promotion of civil rights, it also, according to McPherson, "curtailed
and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing
struggle to fairly discrete parameters" (30).

Crystallizing the intersection between Operating Systems and race
relations, McPherson asserts that "Certain modes of racial visibility
and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing
data" (24). McPherson emphasizes the "rules" of UNIX philosophy, which
lay out how UNIX's development prioritized the organization and
simplification of data processing:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where
you must. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear
by demonstration that nothing else will do. Rule of Transparency:
Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier... Rule
of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be
stupid and robust. 26
#+END_QUOTE
The rules of "Simplicity" and "Parsimony" ensure that programs will be
composed of small, interlocking parts that can be easily updated and
transported to newer versions. The rule of "Transparency" flattens
nuance and ambiguity, making program components as legible as
possible. The rule of "Representation," particularly the suggestion to
"Fold knowledge into data" reduces the complexity of raw data, so that
it can be easily input into multiple processes. According to
McPherson, all of these rules work together to shore up the central
design theory of "modularity,"[fn:16] which stipulates that components
are self-contained and interoperable, so they can be independently
created, modified, and replaced without affecting the whole system.

The role of control in creating the internet and the emphasis on data
reduction in developing operating stystems leave their legacies on
21st century digital technology, where race becomes collapsed into
data. Echoing McPherson, Ruha Benjamin asserts that technology
reproduces social inequities under the guise of objectivity and
progressivism.[fn:17] Turning to technology, Benjamin explores how
innovations in Artificial Intelligence and algorithmic computing
extend racist paradigms into ever new tools, particularly in data
gathering and surveillance. The creators of these new technologies
mark, track, and quantify blackness, for example, in databases for
healthcare or financial services that associate "black names" with
criminality (Benjamin 5). With each update, technology is continually
promoted as efficient and progressive in a way that masks how it
exploits data about its subjects. Benjamin explains, "we are told that
how tech sees “difference” is a more objective reflection of reality
than if a mere human produced the same results... bias enters through
the backdoor of design optimization in which the humans who create the
algorithms are hidden from view" (5-6). As she points out, "the road
to inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7). Like the creators of
UNIX, the creators of such tools and algorithms operate under
assumptions of white universality that inevitably marks blackness as
"other."

*** sedgwick on liberatory vs prohibition
Sedgwick searches for "some ways of understanding human desire that might
be quite to the side of prohibition and repression, that might hence
be structured quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory,'
inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting down and attacking
prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic guises" (10).

The profusion of hyperlinks frustrates the reader by offering too many

*** Kittler, Friedrich. Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. 1999.

At first, media passes through symbols (written signifier), then
analog media is stored as physical traces, and now, new media loses
its specificity as a stream of numbers (“eyewash”), surface effects
which are then reassembled in the human. The human perceptual system
disperses into the apparatus.
 
What sense perceptions are we not aware of or not tapping? This opens
up the potentials of bits and fiber.

The way that media works in the 21st century both marginalizes and

sensations are indirect. This puts consciousness in an anticipatory
mode, always future oriented, focusing on what is nearly emergent---
“feed forward”.

Individual texts are witnesses of an ideal text that is never to be

Bibliography is about tracking the book’s history as a social
document, the social relations involved in its transmission, and about
recognizing different critic’s “misreadings”. Book history is a
history of misreadings.

Using TEI to teach close reading finds that one can approach it to
engage individualized readings---marking moments of textual
instability rather than formal aspects. Given that the tool is
flexible enough, we do not have to agree on a schema, standardize a
schema, in order to use the tool to engage the incommensurable.

certain elements of the text? It turns out that the limitations of the

[fn:6] Da's emphasis on the “reproducible” in CLS extends Franco
Moretti's originating call for a “falsifiable criticism”: both
advocate for a methodology that is as reliable and verifiable as the
social sciences. According to Moretti: “Testing” literary
interpretations be the same process as in scientific disciplines --
demanding that interpretations are “coherent, univocal, and complete,”
and are tested against “data” that appears to contradict it (/Signs/
21). (another quote: “The day criticism gives up its battle cry ‘it is
possible to interpret this element in the following way,’ to replace
it with the much more prosaic, ‘the following interpretation is
impossible for such and such a reason,’ it will have taken a huge step
forward on the road of methodological solidity” (/Signs/ 22).)
