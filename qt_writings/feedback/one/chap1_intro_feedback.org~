* Chapter One Introduction: Feedback

** chapter overview

The purpose of this chapter is to draw attention to the parallels
between the ways that we only have access to /data/ and /queerness/ as
formalizations, and how such queer forms suggest a new way of reading.
    - we encounter the digital object through mediation---interface,
      keyboards, coding languages. It is the same with queerness,
      which is expressed in the formal and aesthetic experiments of
      queer writers.

The introduction kicks off this mediation on the intersection of the
digital and queerness, by elaborating on this idea of /touch/. I draw
a parallel between what Rosenberg is doing with touch, refusing direct
contact to activate a fuller sensorium, and Fisher who frustrates
touch as a means of traversing/grasping the narrative. Both put touch
at a remove, deferring it. 

In the rest of the chapter, I look at other critical methods from
science and historiography as examples of how the results of inquiry
are always predetermined by the existing knowledge structures. 
    - this is why we turn to affect and aesthetics as reading methods.

The embodied experience of engaging with digitized texts gets us out
of the self-replicating loop.  

    ---> this is about playing with formalizations to find something
    new?

This work has been done by Chicanx, POC theorists, scholars who turn
to intuition and speculation as critical methods: Hartman, Lowe,
Anzaldua. 

I draw parallels between these and feminist DHers, emphasizing three
values for "queer DH":
- opacity (perspective)
- dynamicity (performance)
- provisionality (ephemerality)


** in preparation of review...

Defining 'queer' --- 

- queer experience is inaccessible. It is therefore always deferred,
  in the vein of Munoz's "queer as a structural/educated mode of
  desiring ... not yet here."

- the affective/subjective experience of being queer is inaccessible
  by structures of knowledge that reconsolidate queerness into
  digestible and knowable categories.

**** draw out what I mean by "subjectivity" --- and "subjectivity cannot
be accessed"
- do not feel responsible for defining subjectivity, you can point to
  "social constructs," "socially constructed norms",
  "heteronormativity", "social discourse")
    - is queer a subjectivity or /an embodiment/? 

---> being queer, or the foundational experience of queerness that I
want to emphasize, is the /affective/ experience. This affective
experience is the basis for subjectivity that is inaccessible --- see:
    - Anzaldua's choque points to the clash of affects
    - Munoz's not here points to the deferral as a core condition of
      queerness

Butler's point on the formalization of subjectivity: "Where there is
an 'I' who utters or speaks and thereby produces an effect in
discourse, there is first a discourse which precedes and enables that
'I' and forms in language the constraining trajectory of its
will. Thus there is no 'I' who stands /behind/ discourse and executes
its volition or will /through/ discourse. On the contrary, the 'I'
only comes into being through being called, named, interpellated (to
use the Althusserian term), and this discursive constitution takes
place prior to the 'I'... Futher, the impossibility of a full
recognition, that is, of ever fully inhabiting the name by which one's
social identity is inaugurated and mobilized, implies the instability
and incompleteness of subject-formation" ("Critically Queer," 18).
- There is no subjectivity, or if there is, it escapes
  inscription/interpellation. What is inscribed/interpellated is a
  produced by a discourse that enables and structures the "I". As a
  result, this subject can never be fully known--"the impossibility of
  a full recognition."
- The emphais I want to make about subject formation -- the "I" -- is
  a kind of formalization: what Butler calls a "citation," of a
  reiterated action that precedes and overtakes the position of the
  "subject." There is a structuring power that determines the
  constitution of the "I."


-----------------------> queerness (the experience of queerness) is
inaccessible because dominant structures of knowledge reconsolidate
raw queerness into something structured, transformed.
   - Schutte's incommensurability points to what will always be lost
     by dominant groups
   - Cite Foucault's history of sexuality on this ...  



---> we can engage with queerness in its formalized, abstracted
forms. This is where aesthetics comes in. We can touch queerness at a
distance. This is the goal of my reading practice --- not to know or
figure out queerness, but to engage with its formalizations, ot feel
it. This is where the mediation of digital media comes in. 

**** is subjectivity produced by touch, or prior to touch? Jacob's point
on the problem of embodiment.  
    - Bulter would say that bodies don't exist prior to touch. Social
      norms produce the homosexual for its own reconsolidation. 
    - Foucault says that homosexuals become a species as a result of
      the disciplines.

In /bodies that matter/, Butler makes the point that the body’s
materiality is discursive, that the “sexed body” is discursively
constructed. 

We cannot speak outside the powers that structure speech. Subjects are
always interpellated by the discourse prior to citing it. Like
protocol, discourse determines all connections; in gender, the subject
only comes into intelligibility through the matrix of gender. The only
freedom that is possible resides within this power of discourse,
resignifying it, perhaps through parody or impersonation. The
performance of resignification is a political act. We see this in the
word “queer” which has been re-appropriated---something that signified
abjectness now means defiance.

Here, Butler is looking for the “exploit”, the way out of the system
by using the system’s own rules. Using language and repetition to
resignify what sexuality and proper sexual relations are.  “What would
it mean to cite a law to produce it differently?”: What’s most
interesting to me is how Butler subscribes to the power system of that
which she wants to overturn. She and Foucault (and early Sedgwick) are
still firmly within this system. They do not want to go beyond sexual
categories/definitions, but to use it to their own purposes. This is
analogous to a group of readings in my Digital Studies list, the
Networks readings. Some of the group want to subvert the network
within the confines of that network. Others want to completely,
thinkers like later Sedgwick, Heather Love and Jose Munoz who look for
a way out of this system.


**** incorporate more theory. Claim Munoz earlier, just state it, don't
defend it. 

**** make a clear connection between embodiment and touch. 
**** define/extrapolate/footenote terms:
Access (par.1):

Subjectivity (par.1):

Raw Content (par.1):

Abstraction (par.2):

digital media, which is a formalization of the inexpressible (par.2):

**** my notes: add more media archaeology at the end, connect to QT
The point I make here about Fisher is how the structure of the
narrative prevents any real grasp of the narrator's intentions,
motives, characterization. There is no coherent subject here. 

This is on the level of narrative, there is also a deeper sense that
things are disjunctive or incoherent on the level of media. 
How does the internet transfer these files to your computer? Through
TCP/IP. 

Talk about the ways that code determine all communication / and
subject formation.
