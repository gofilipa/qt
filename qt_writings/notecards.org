*** Bode, Katherine. “Data beyond representation: From computational
modelling to performative materiality.” MLA Convention, Seattle, 10
January 2020. https://katherinebode.wordpress.com/home/mla-convention-2020/

Bode approaches quantitative analysis as performative, and takes a
self-conscious appraisal of the tools of analysis. Her work interferes
at the boundary of the humanities and social sciences, trying to draw
ever more distinctions between their methods and approach. What
statisticians value as “representativeness” or “reproducibility” isn’t
as important (within a humanities context) as the materiality of the
apparatus. Rather than attempt to secure a factual or objective status
of the data, we should double down on the idiosyncracies of our
tools. According to Bode, we should “approach literary databases… in
performative terms” and our analyses of them as “effects of
material-semiotic engagements”. 

- “This project aims to progress a central insight of cultural
  criticism: that meaning is not carried by texts but produced in
  situated interactions between readers, texts and
  contexts. Conceptually, the project works at the intersection of
  human reading and computer modeling to resist their common
  opposition and explore how digital forms and methods might progress
  critical agendas of the humanities, and vice versa. This theoretical
  investigation occurs alongside – enables and is enabled by – a
  data-rich one. Using massively expanded digital evidence of
  reception of Australian literature (in academic journals, newspapers
  and social media book reviewing platforms such as GoodReads and
  LibraryThing), the project explores reading and modeling in terms of
  emerging and intersecting assemblages of human and nonhuman
  actors ("Reading at the Interface").
- For my current, /Reading at the Interface/ database, I’m interested
  in how different collections of paratexts (or writings about
  literature) might materialise or constitute different versions of
  “Australian literature”" (par. 14).
- "at present, discussion of “representativeness” and
  “reproducibility” are bound up together, with the implication that
  if we can represent something accurately enough the results of
  analysis will be reproducible. Foregrounding the apparatus, by
  contrast, recognises that our knowledge making practices, as Karen
  Barad puts it, “contribute to, and are part of, the phenomena we
  describe”" (par. 26).

Performativity: Modeling scholarly editions 
- “In the book I wrote with the Australian Newspaper Fiction Database,
  I proposed responding to this situation by modelling our databases
  on scholarly editions. With some exceptions, scholarly editors also
  don’t use the language of performativity. But a scholarly edition
  doesn’t represent a literary work (or, I suggested, a literary
  system); rather, it intervenes in – simultaneously transforming and
  engaging with – a complex unfolding event" (par. 23). 

"More recently, however, just as Mandell argues that digital scholarly
environments shouldn’t be conceived as fixed, I now wonder if the
framework of the scholarly edition is rather too bound by print
conventions. As a consequence, in Reading at the Interface, I’m
exploring what it might mean to conceive of literary databases as
apparatuses, in the sense the term is used in various scientific
disciplines, particularly physics. There, an apparatus is a specific
material configuration, including of physicists, wherein certain
properties become determinate, while others are excluded. One can’t
measure light as a particle and a wave using the same apparatus; but
that doesn’t mean that light is not one thing when it is measured as
the other. Although it must be said that the phenomena explored in
digital literary studies are much more diverse than those for which
apparatuses in physics are developed, I wonder if shifting to a
conception of measurements as effects of particular material
arrangements might help us to reframe some key debates in our field."
(Bode "Data Beyond Representation, par. 24).

*** Bode, Katherine. ‘Why You Can’t Model Away Bias,’ Modern Language
Quarterly (2020) 81 (1): 95–124.

Bode brings the discourse of textual scholarship, bibliography
studies, scholarly editing into conversations about quantitative
literary studies. There’s an attention to form, ethics, modeling in
these areas of inquiry which make them more self aware of how they are
transforming “data” prior to analysis.  Bode’s position is that QLS
ought to begin by considering the types of gaps and biases in
evidence. She wants critics to incorporate analyses from textual
studies prior to running statistical tests. We should build QLS out of
these areas of humanistic inquiry that center interpretation. There
are certain processes in statistical analysis that maintain bias and
unknown assumptions: sampling and comparison do not get an accurate
picture if what we are searching for is unfindable or harder to find. 

Responding to Ted Underwood’s Distant Horizons. Critique on
“perspectival modeling” as ignoring ethical issues that persist with
scale.
- “Underwood’s proposal to replace data modeling with sampling and
  comparison, alone or in concert with perspectival modeling, is
  ultimately inseparable from his view of the literary past as a
  single system of interlocking parts. But the literary past, and
  (quantitative) literary studies, are spaces of highly differentiated
  knowledges, opportunities, constraints, resources, and
  possibilities, and these must be considered in any arguments about,
  or propositions for the future of, the discipline” (116).

Describes a disagreement between quantitative literary critics about
the role of analysis and historicization of datasets prior to
statistical analysis. Bode’s position is that QLS ought to begin by
considering the types of gaps and biases in evidence. She wants
critics to incorporate analyses from textual studies prior to running
statistical tests.
- “quantitative literary studies should begin by trying, as much as
  possible, to consider the nature of ontological gaps and
  epistemological biases in its evidence” (97).


The model precedes the computation: “A dataset of digital texts is not
simply found – or extracted, harvested, downloaded, mined, and so on –
prior to being modeled using computational methods; rather, modeling
is the means by which literary concepts and artefacts are both made
computable and computed” (100).

*** Bode, Katherine. “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’
Reading; or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History.” MLQ
78.1 (2017): 77-106.

Critiques “distant reading” (ala Moretti & Jockers) for the way it reduces and dehistoricizes literary data. Distant reading, in this sense, actually resembles close reading, which builds out of New Critical attention to text as data, which neglects textual scholarship. In its place, Bode proposes the “scholarly edition” as a unit of analysis. Distant and Close reading make the same assumptions. What we need is not a new method, but a new object. 

- “What Jockers actually shows is the capacity of his computational
  method (a combination of stylistic analysis, topic modeling, and
  network analysis) to predict whether a particular work (or rather, a
  “bag of words” from that work [134]) was by a man or woman, from a
  particular decade, of a particular genre, or by an author of a
  particular nationality, from a corpus defined according to those
  parameters” (88).

Representationalism: the idea that our critical processes are
analyzing things out there in the world that are separate from our
ability / attempts to analyze them. 

The model that guides much of computational text analysis follows a
methodological process that assumes the output (often visualization)
as a result of the input and method. 
- Early 2010s: "presenting data as a direct representation of the
literary past" (this is Moretti). 
- Late 2010s: then a shift to "modeling," where we create a model based on
subjective or constructed representations (this is Underwood). 

She looks at how her own analysis of paratexts in /Reading at the
Interface/ literally creates a boundary of what we understand to be
"text" and "paratext." Not that this is a bad thing, but that we are
intevening performatively with the object of analysis, co-constructing
it. 

Her goal is to "materilize the platform in ways that cannot be
separated from the categories [she's] using in [her] analysis."

There seems to be a parallelism between Bode and Butler: 
"When computational literary scholars engage with literary phenomena,
I'm suggesting that we have two options. So we can approach this
practice in representationalist terms. We can imagine that our
databases and data sets and models are symbolic expressions by knowing
agents us have stable self evident and self contained objects that
exist elsewhere. And that actually follow a print based model of how
literature exists. Alternatively, we can understand our databases or
models as part of the ongoing materialisation of literary texts as
emerging events always arising from an altering how the literary
pastas reconfigured"

Pleasantly with the Eyes and Ears." Digital Studies/le Champ
Numérique, 3(2). DOI: http://doi.org/10.16995/dscn.236

In this essay Tanya Clement explores what visualization has to offer
hermeneutics. She puts forth a theory of “play” in which the critic,
performs so to speak the work in a way that opens up interpretive
possibilities. Clement makes an analogy between musical scores and
visualization---both are attempts to at once abstract and concretize
elements from the text as part of a larger interpretive experience.
- “it is read, but it is also meant to be played, to be spatialized in
  time and embodied by voices (or instruments) within a certain
  physical and hermeneutical context. I am arguing the same is true of
  computational visualizations of text. One ‘reads’ a visualization,
  but to ‘play the visualisation is to engage the spatialized
  interpretation of that visualisation as an embodied reader in a
  situated context within a specific hermeneutical framework”
  (par. 10).
- “Instead of reading the a two-dimensional visualisation as the
  inevitable result (or complete representation) of data analysis, we
  learn to read visualisations as musical scores, as signposts
  pointing toward many possible interpretive ‘results’ or readings”
  (par. 12).
- “musical and computational transpositions create another level of
  abstraction with which the interpreter engages" (par. 7).
- "Ultimately, visualisations are not the end product, nor is the data
  where the inquiry begins. The traditions reflected in a
  computational visualisation are always part of a hermeneutic
  framework that is also always part of a history of technological and
  methodological remediations" ("Distant Listening" par.22).

In what ways does working with audio bring us to reconsider the ways
we approach electronic text? Takes up McGann and McKenzie’s ideas
about material, social, and institutional contexts that resist the
notion of an ideal or Ur text, and applies it to audio-texts.

- "I introduce a tool called ARLO that we have been developing in the
  High Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship
  (HiPSTAS) project (http://www.hipstas.org) for accessing and
  analyzing sound collections alongside new standards being proposed
  for the development of audio visual (AV) metadata and content
  models. The discussion concludes by considering what these
  interventions tell us about how a rationale of audio textuality
  helps us rethink rationales of text in digital environments"
  (par. 1).
- “three aspects of textuality that could be foregrounded through
  event-centric content and discovery models: collective
  intentionality, emergent performativity, and indexical
  performativity” (31).
- “A model of textuality that represents text as a spatial and
  temporal phenomenon might allow for interactions and representations
  in a digital environment that, rather than insisting on fixity,
  foreground principles of emergence” (34).
- “What if all entities were modeled as dynamic events? Would notions
  of collective intentionality, emergence, and indexical
  performativity foreground our searches and shape what we are able to
  find? Text is central to the Humanities, but as the editor of this
  special issue notes, “digitization remediates all analog sources
  into a common binary format,” a situation which serves as an
  invitation to think through these remediations towards the
  development of future information systems that will continue to
  shape new and different rationales of text” (44)

- Abstract: “In Transition: Selected Poems by the Baroness Elsa von
  Freytag-Loringhoven is a publicly available scholarly edition of
  twelve unpublished poems written by Freytag-Loringhoven between 1923
  and 1927. This edition provides access to a textual performance of
  her creative work in a digital environment.... One aspect of
  textual performance theory I am exploring within In Transition
  concerns the social text network...  these networks in a digital
  edition foreground the situated 1920s history of these texts as well
  as the real-time, situated electronic reading environment. The
  argument of a digital edition like In Transition is formed as much
  by the underlying theory of text as it is by its content and the
  particular application or form it takes. This discussion employs the
  language of knowledge representation in computation (through terms
  like domain, ontology, and logic) in order to situate this scholarly
  edition within two existing frameworks: theories of knowledge
  representation in computation and theories of scholarly textual
  editing" ("Knowledge Representation" par. 1).

- "a text in performance comprises multiple versions in manuscript and
  print, various notes and letters and comments of contemporaries or
  current readers, plus the element of performance, which entails
  time, space, and a collaborative audience” ("Knowledge
  Representation" par. 3).

- “the Baroness’s manuscripts often do not correspond to a sequence
  that manifests the teleological evolution of a poem. In some cases,
  the extant manuscripts show little evidence of a clear, creative
  evolutionary path within a text. Indeed, the Baroness’s manuscripts
  often manifest experiments on a theme, making one version’s
  relationship to another an example of alternative choices rather
  than a system of rough drafts leading to final versions” "Knowledge
  Representation" (par. 5).

- “with this work we imagine what is possible in creating a singularly
  digital text environment that requires the reader to ask, how does
  this environment work? How is it constructed? What new and
  traditional modes of textuality are at play and at risk here?”
  ("Knowledge Representation" par. 25).

- Abstract: “Used here to describe the investigation of significant
  sound or prosodic patterns within the context of a system that can
  translate these patterns into comparative visualizations across
  texts, the term ‘distant listening’ is used provocatively to suggest
  that readers might interpret prosodic patterns as ‘noise’ (or
  seemingly unintelligible information) with close reading
  practices. In this study, we show that these same patterns appear
  coherent and discoverable within ProseVis, a visualization tool that
  supports these hermeneutics within a discovery-based paradigm that
  allows for new ways of making meaning. … In the second part of this
  discussion, we consider how changing similarity metric calculations
  through the inclusion and exclusion of certain prosodic features
  (such as tone and stress) and algorithmic parameters (such as the
  window size of sounds and weighting power) can facilitate the
  discovery of previously unidentifiable author-similarity patterns”
  (par. 1).

*** Moretti, Franco. *Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History*. 2007. Print.
- Moretti supports a positivist agenda for literary criticism. He
  ascribes an objective status to visualizations, as if they aren’t
  based on subjective research (monographs!) and his own decision
  making. He also neglects to fully embrace his own readings as
  subjective, and calls them “explanations” rather than
  “interpretations”.
- Basically, Moretti minimizes his role as a critic, in service of a
  larger, collective project on doing literary history. But he doesn’t
  have to minimize the critic’s reading to feel like he’s part of a
  collective.

*** Drucker, Johanna. "Introduction," *SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing*. 2009. PDF.
- Drucker uses the computer for creative ends. Computation geared
  toward speculation rather than testing or confirmation.
- Doesn’t this line of argument perpetuate the idea that the computer
  is more objective than the human? That the computer ultimately
  remains a rational tool? Isn’t it just pointing the direction of
  interpretation at a new target, which is speculation, while still
  using the same gun? Is this right?
- How would speculation and potentiality play into a feminist
  project/reading?

*** Drucker, Johanna. "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display." *DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly*. 2011. Web.
- Drucker argues that data visualization tools and techniques
  naturalize and flatten things that are actually complex and
  ambiguous. She proposes that we switch “data” (given) for “capta”
  (taken), to emphasize how all information has been constructed,
  pre-cooked (never raw). She proposes that we skew and blur and
  disrupt the neatness of our graphs and charts.
- But isn’t this just turning criticism into poetry? Don’t we need
  something stronger, clearer,more delineated?
- What is the role is clarity and “realist” or “natural” constructions
  of knowledge?

- Felski usefully talks about reading as an affective

*** Mandell, Laura. “Gender and Cultural Analytics: Finding or Making
  Stereotypes?” Debates in Digital Humanities 2019. Edited by Matthew
  K. Gold and Lauren Klein. University of Minnesota Press, 2019.

Mandell makes the overall argument that gender is not reducible to M/F
binary, as distant readers presume. Gender is something historically
situated, that has to be unpacked, deconstructed. 

However, it is /not/ like genre, not like a writing style that you can
imitate. Gender is not something that is "constructed" by the
measured, like genre, but something that the writer participates in. 

paragraphs
data as capta par. 23
gender par. 28

The categories “male” and “female” are discursively, socially
constituted, and quantitative analysis essentializes and generalizes
them. This doesn’t mean we should avoid doing quantitative
analysis. It means we need to historicize the gender categories, and
dynamicize the results of analysis. Computers are malleable and pliant
tools for this kind of analysis.

“Dynamically reading, generating, and analyzing numbers are essential
to making interpretive quantification possible and thus to exploring
how the M/F binary is constituted in any given historical moment. This
chapter examines two instances of gender analysis, performed via
stylometry, word-frequency analysis, and topic modeling, that veer
toward naïve empiricism because they take the distinction between M/F
to be transparent. Imbuing cultural analytics with feminist theory, I
argue here, shows us that we can animate numerical processes rather
than fixing their results as stereotype.”

“Computer screens as opposed to stereotyped pages easily afford the
fluid exploration of parameters and taxonomies, through which many
sorts of experiments can be tested: interactive visualizations can
give us not objective answers rooted in aggressively reductive
oppositions, but parallax, multiple perspectives for viewing a very
complex reality. In analyzing gender, the computational analysis of
culture should never be understood as an objective observer measuring
an inert reality. Rather, it should be understood as a means of
counting people counting.”

“we must remain attentive to where and how computational data
analytics crosses the line into naïve empiricism—often unwittingly—by
presenting conclusions about “male” and “female” modes of thinking and
writing as if the M/F terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic
reality, transparently referential and not discursively constituted.”

“Are there feedback loops built into data? Has it been collected,
sorted, and even produced according to the categories M/F? It is to
answer those questions, in the case of text-mining novels, that I now
turn” Weaves in Drucker’s discussion on capta, Liu’s discussion on
human-machine entanglement.

Looking and gender through genre, comparing Wollenstonecraft, Godwin,
Johnson across genres. Finds more similarity in genre than gender, and
finds a space to speculate on the assumptions of gender in
analysis. Uses the dynamicity of computers to study gender.

“Anyone can adopt gendered modes of behavior, just as anyone can write
in genres stereotypically labeled M/F… gender approaches nearly to the
definition of genre.”
 
“stylometry will only become a valuable tool of literary criticism if
we admit that categories such as gender are being constructed both by
the measurer and the measured. Once this process is accepted, we might
then be able to use stylometry to experiment with new taxonomies of
gender”

*** Piper, Andrew. *Enumerations: Data and Literary Study*, 2018. Print.
- This shows how distant and close reading can be used together ---
  Distant reading provides context, or framework, for close reading;
  in which number becomes a lens, a frame of the quantitative, to
  approach closer readings and even inform further model building.
- Though computation facilitates literary analysis, a number of flawed
  premises about distance, bigness, or objectivity (which lack a
  science of generalization), have clouded the ways we approach
  computation (9).
    - “Entanglement is a far more appropriate way of thinking about
      literary modeling than the disembodied eye in the sky of the
      lone, distant reader” (19).
        - By incorporating models/graphs/visualizations, “We are no
          longer using our own judgments as benchmarks... but
          explicitly constructing the context through which something
          is seen as significant (and the means through which
          significance is assessed).... It interweaves subjectivity
          with objects” (17).
- With Machine Learning, engages a speculative method: “We see how
  “feeling” is gradually redefined over time by the novel away from an
  emotional state to one of perceptual encounter. This sense of the
  contemporary novel’s investment in sensorial embodiment awaits
  fuller treatment” (117).

*** Ramsay, Stephen. *Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism*. 2011. Print.
- Ramsay positions himself as a moderate, saying that computers are
  merely tools, part of a more expansive subjective process, of
  hermeneutics. His ideas here agree nicely with Drucker’s in Speclab.
- What’s particularly useful about Ramsay is his opposing of
  humanistic endeavor against scientific inquiry. This specifies how
  observation is a phenomenal, subjective experience, and is
  antithetical to the motives and processes of scientific inquiry, the
  scientific method. Ramsay allows us to understand how empirics(?)
  can be subsumed within a humanistic frame, which does not attempt to
  ascertain “truth” but only “potentiality”.
- Like Drucker, isn't Ramsay speaks as if the computer is this
  uber-objective tool? Like code/software has no biases or
  idiosyncrasies? What about examining the way that these processes
  encode subjectivity?

*** Rockwell, Geoffrey and Stefan Sinclair. *Hermeneutica: Computer Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities* MIT Press 2016. 

"Hermeneutica tries to correct for the Cartesian solitudes of text and
method by showing how analytical tools /are/ instantiations of
interpretive methods that can be woven closely into other
hermeneutical things, like text" (4).

They are using Descartes (and Ramsay uses Roberto Busa) to build up
the theoretical understanding of text analysis. (But I want to do
something different.) Whereas Descartes takes the solitary thinker as
his method, they take thinking as a communal, participatory activity,
which can be further enhanced with tools and texts - "this story is
more about what is needed when one wants to augment interpretation
with the development of software tools for thinking through" (5). 

"Agile Hermeneutics" (6) -- moving between tool and text in a seamless
way. Quick. 

"a 'black-box' problem. Technique is either encapsulated in the black
box of technology or is unfolded in a mind-numbing tedium of
detail. Either way, something is hidden and something is shown" (15).

"To be as effective as close reading, analytical methods have to be
significantly easier to apply and understand. They have to be like
reading, or better yet, a part of reading. Those invested in the use
of digital analytics need to think differently about what is shown and
what is hidden: the rhetorical presentation of analytics matters"
(16). 




*** So, Richard Jean. "All Models Are Wrong," /PMLA/, 132.3 (2017),
  pp. 668-773. 

All models have errors, there is always a margin of error. The point
isn't to have a correct model, it's to work with the errors, to
iterate new versions of the model. Incorporate working with error as
part of the critical process.

"an individual exceeds socially constructed identity categories, so
what does a model do besides reify such categories?" (668).

"What’s important is not to insist on how the model is right or nearly
right but rather to understand how it is wrong... the reader is
encouraged to reason with the model and its maker to better grasp the
data." (671).

"using an iterative process is that it pivots between distant and
close reading... close reading here is inseparable from recursively
improving one’s model" (671).

"error is a constitutive part of science and that quantitative
literary criticism would beneit from viewing error as less something
to be tolerated or avoided and more something to be integrated
formally into our research (Wimsatt). Accepting that all models are
wrong might prove liberating" (672).

*** So, Richard Jean and Edwin Roland. “Race and Distant Reading, PMLA
  Special Topic: Varieties of Digital Humanities. Vol. 35 No. 1,
  January 2020, pp. 59–73.

Asks the question, how do you make use of computation/quantification
for dealing with race? Engages distant reading and the critique of
race and racial difference, which are mismatched in purpose (as Da
points out). Finds that we can use the machine to explore the
constructedness of social categories, in this case, how white is only
coherent when it is set against the incoherence of blackness. In the
process, it is useful for bringing up new elements that might have
escaped our attention.  Because race is a construct, we must be
reflexive: “a reflexive method that is able to identify its own
elisions while also pointing to new insights and opportunities for
research” (72).

So and Roland manipulate the results of quantitative analysis (what is
written by black vs white authors) in order to *deconstruct* the
apparent categories between black and white. They find that whiteness
is a coherent category, but only because it depends on the incoherence
of blackness. (TIE IN TO EVE SEDGEWICK ON THE BINARY) “Novels by black
authors show a wider variety of engagements with the features that
allow us to distinguish between novels by white and black
writers---the very basis of our model” (65). “this coherence [of white
authorship] is derived entirely from its relation to blackness. Novels
by white authors cluster within a tight band of expression, but only
through their expression of blackness” (66).

There is a central mismatch between data analysis and race: “The goal
of machine classification is to identify and label objects. The point
of minority discourse analysis is, in part, to critique and
problematize the very idea of categories” (63).
- Race shows how measurement fails to get at it: “Race is a category
  that escapes measurement or simply renders it untenable”
  (60). Quantifying race reinforces differences, reductions,
  stratification. “Reading race distantly thus requires quantification
  of racial identity or racialized language” (60).

“the machine simply measures the robustness of the social
constructedness of these given categories and points out what gives
them such vigor” (69).

“We have not read any scholarship that has noted the importance of the
word appalled in this novel. Without the machine’s aid, we would never
have noticed it. Yet, a word so seemingly incidental turns out to
expose a decisive repatterning of whiteness in the text” (71).

--> they are dealing with the same problem as Da, dealing with
computational error, but they suggest an interesting way out of the
problem. Their process combines deconstruction and speculation.

--> this is interesting, but it's too ambivalent between
deconstruction and speculation. It doesn't give the computer enough
credit for the ways it transforms data that is itself
speculative. What if we started with this premise of the "appalled"? 
    - “To illustrate the limits of standard computational methods for the
      analysis of race and to produce a series of results that nonetheless
      advance our understanding of the texts and authors under
      investigation… exposing the racial limitations of computation can
      reveal things otherwise occluded within literary history” (61).  
     
 → What kind of knowledge are we trying to create? Aren't we now
    operating as if it is possible to “distant read” in the first
    place? That there are things which can be quantified, if only we
    ask the right questions? When we look to the "occluded", are we
    hunting or speculating?  The orientation we take toward our object
    has an effect. Are we trying to recover or to speculate?

*** Underwood, Ted. *Distant Horizons*
Much of literary history is invisible to us due to our blindness to
large scales. Though it is no substitute for the sensitivity of close
reading, Distant reading allows us to see larger patterns across
centuries and periods.

- Uses "perspectival modeling," which is a way of testing computer
  models, or the results from computer modeling.
    - "a model---a relation between variables---instead of a single axis
      of measurement" (19).
    - A bag-of-words representation... We represent each character by the
      adjectives that modify them, the verbs they governm and so
      on---excluding only words that explicitly name a gendered role like
      /boyhood/ or /wife/. Then, we present characters, labeled with
      grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. The algorithm will
      learn what it means to be 'masculine' or 'feminine' purely by
      observing what men and women actually do in stories. The model
      produced by the algorithm can make predictions about other
      characters, previously unseen" (115). 

- Quantitative methods are not anymore objective than close
reading. But they are not as "sensitive" or "exacting" as close
reading, and are mostly useful for long views. 
    - "If we look with fresh eyes at contemporary quantitative methods, we
      may notice that they are not distinguished by any aspiration to
      objectivity. Machine learning, in particular, is causing public
      scandal because it tends to be all too sensitive to subjective

    - "machine learning tends to absorb assumptions latent in the evidence
      it is trained on. By training models on evidence selected by
      different people, we can crystallize different social perspectives
      and compare them rigorously to each other... which I call
      'perspectival modeling'" (xv).
    - "Critics who want to sensitively describe the merits of a single
      work usually have no need for statistics... Computational
      analysis of a text is more flexible than it used to be, but it
      is still quite crude compared to human reading; it helps mainly
      with questions where evidence is simply too big to fit in a
      single reader's memory" (xxi).
    - "The imprecision of the human world is part of the reason why
      numbers are so useful in social science: they allow researchers to
      describe continua instead of sorting everything into discrete
      categories" (20).

- Repeatedly stresses that the point of quantitative methods is to
  discover new scales of analysis, but he seems to be looking for an
  overarching theory that will encapsulate literary
  history. Quantitative methods seek to overcome a problem of
  attention, of memory, in order to gain a large view. Here, human
  memory is a hindrance, rather than a drive. The goal is rather to
  multiply alternative readings. 
    - Attention determines analysis, analysis determines knowledge,
      knowledge determines disciplines, periodization (8).
    - "The challenge is to find a perspective that makes the descriptions
      preferred by eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century

- His examination reveals, as he projected, that initial assumptions
  will determine the the form of the result. In looking at the way gender
  is characterized, or rather how models characterize gender, in
  novels from the 18th century to today, he finds that results
  reproduce some of the structuring assumptions from the outset. If
  gender is binary, then the relation between male and female will be
  one of opposition. 
    - "explores the history of characterization, looking in particular at
      the way fictional characters are shaped by implicit assumptions
      about gender... how easy it would be to distinguish fictional women
      from men, using only the things they are represented as doing in the
      text. When first names and pronouns are set aside, can a model still
      predict a characters grammatical gender?"  (xvii). 
    - "while gender roles were becoming more flexible, the attention
      actually devoted to women was declining" (114).
    - His questions build in causality: "we can ask how strongly public
      signs of gender shaped characterization in general. Were fictive
      men quite different from fictive women, or were the differences
      between characters unrelated to conventional signs of gender?"
      (115). 
    - "one possible conclusion would be that the structural positions of
      masculine and feminine identity, vis-a-vis each other, have remained
      very stable---while the actual content of masculinity and femninity
      has been entirely mutable. It is also possible, of course, that this
      chapter has discovered stable 'structural positions' only because it
      explores gender, for the most part, as a binary opposition.... it
      would also be possible to represent those changes as the /blurring/
      of a boundary to produce a spectrum or as a /multiplication/ of
      gender identities that made the binary opposition between masculine
      and feminine increasingly irrelevant to characters' plural
      roles" (140).
          - --> the question then becomes, how can we do criticism
            that doesn't reproduce our own assumptions? The answer is
            that we cannot. But we can try to incorporate, as much as
            possible, alternative reading methods. This happens only
            through and play.

- Distant reading allows us to see that fiction is more 'embodied'
  than nonfiction: 
    - "the novel steadily specialized in something that biography (and
      other forms of nonfiction) could rarely provide: descriptions of
      bodies, physical actions, and immediate sensory perceptions in a
      precisely specified place and time" (26).

      Vol. 35 No. 1, January 2020, pp. 92-109.  

Abstract: Numbers appear to have limited value for literary study,
since our discipline is usually more concerned with exploring
differences of interpretation than with describing the objective
features of literary works. But it may be time to reexamine the
assumption that numbers are useful only for objective
description. Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being
objective and rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in
the evidence used to train them. To dramatize perspectival uses of
machine learning, I train models of genre on groups of books
categorized by historical actors who range from Edwardian advertisers
to contemporary librarians. Comparing the perspectives implicit in
their choices casts new light on received histories of
genre. Scientific romance and science fiction—whose shifting names
have often suggested a fractured history—turn out to be more stable
across two centuries than the genre we call fantasy. (TU).

Underwood aims to measure the "transformations" of gender "as we move
from one period or perspective to another" ("Machine Learnig and Human
Perspective" 93)

→ Underwood plays out the warning of Sedgwick about the way that
binaries work. His analysis of gender reproduces gender as a binary
system. We reproduce our assumptions. This is a sense that reproducing
is stale, not novel, doesn’t keep the conversation going.  “Each axis
is, in short, a model of a particular perspective on gender” (94).

“we find words that men tend to apply to men and that women tend to
apply to women… we have a group of words that men use in describing
men and that women use in describing women” (94)

“Instead of trying to define gender, this diagram models a contrast
between two perspectives on the topic… I needed a simple picture,
frankly, in order to explain how a quantitative model can be said to
represent a perspective” (98).

→ reduction is the place where ethics start to infiltrate
motives. Underwood is not trying to distinguish, he’s trying to
simplify.

*** Underwood, 2017. "A Genealogy of Distant Reading" Digital Humanities Quarterly 11 (2). 
Concerned with establishing the history of distant reading as
connected to a certain mode of inquiry which is empirical, which
borrows from the social sciences: "the central practice that
distinguishes distant reading from other forms of literary criticism
is not at bottom a technology. It is, I will argue, the practice of
framing historical inquiry as an experiment, using hypotheses and
samples (of texts or other social evidence) that are defined before
the writer settles on a conclusion" (par. 5).

What ties together projects in "distant reading" is the kinds of
questions asked, the historical scope, and the method of sampling
evidence: "The common denominator that links all these projects is
simply that they pose broad historical questions about literature, and
answer them by studying samples of social or textual evidence" (par
10). 

Distant reading *aspires* to a science: "In calling this approach
minimally “scientific,” I don’t mean to imply that we must suddenly
adopt all the mores of chemists, or even psychologists. Imaginative
literature matters because readers enjoy it; criticism would gain
nothing if we let meticulous hypothesis-testing drain all the warmth
and flexibility from our writing. Literary historians who use numbers
will have to somehow combine rigor with simplicity, and prune back a
thicket of fiddly details that would be fatal to our reason for caring
about the subject. But within those rhetorical limits, distant reading
can, let us say, aspire to the methods of social science: it is
defined not only by a commitment to historical breadth, but by a
version of the scientific method appropriate for a historical
discipline" (par. 22).

** Networks
*** Galloway, Alexander. *Protocol*, 2004. PDF.
- Codes that append all data…controlling power lies in the technical
  protocols that make network connections possible. “The acceptance of
  universal standardization in order to facilitate the freer and more
  democratic medium” (147).
- The flexibility promoted by a control society is actually used to
  exercise control, requiring autonomous submission. Resistance to
  this kind of control consists of finding loopholes or “exploits” in
  systems (what hackers do).
- DNS and TCP/IP engage a vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal
  (democratic) models of control, with the effect of submitting the
  “freedom” of movement in the network to the authorization of a
  controlling head. This paradox between freedom and control, between
  hierarchy and horizontalism, can perhaps help us to transcend our
  thinking of computers as disambiguation machines.
- A protocol is a wrapper---it does not engage in meaning/content, but
  in possibility, physics or logic. Thinking of protocols as tags that
  are appended, added on, not changing the data but wrapping it, with
  possibility. There is a speculative component here. This is about
  the EXPLOIT.
- “Protocol is a circuit, not a sentence” (52).
- Code is the only language that is executable. It acts out its
  inscriptions, that it applies to something… Code does what it says,
  it goes from declaration to movement. Code has a semantic meaning,
  but it also has an enactment of meaning. It moves.
    - “Code thus purports to be multidimensional. Code draws a line
      between what is material and what is active, in essence saying
      that writing (hardware) cannot do anything, but must be
      transformed into code (software) to be effective… The algorithm
      is prepared in advance, then later executed by the artist”
      (165).

*** Chun, Wendy, *Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics,* 2006. Print.
- How hardware (as opposed to software) engages with the
  freedom/control paradox of internet networks.
- To Chun, the issue isn’t the control technologies that drive the
  internet, but in the way that the workings of the technology is
  obscured, the ways that protocol is hidden and amplified. We aren’t
  aware of the packets that pass through our computer, but they are
  there. “If you believe that your communications are private, it is
  because software corporations, as they relentlessly code and
  circulate you, tell you that you are behind, and not in front of,
  the window” (22)
- All computers engage in this give and take. That’s what make
  networks possible in the first place. Napster just made this
  fundamental truth evident.
- The internet’s potential is not in individual empowerment, but in
  universal exposure, in the way that it exposes us to new
  visibilities that we cannot control.
- What are the possibilities opened up by our vulnerabilities?

*** Bennett, Jane. *Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things*, 2010. PDF.
- Vitality means that things have their own forces, trajectories,
  tendencies.
Thinking of matter as an object or dead makes us destructive; we
assert our power/subjectivity over them rather than acknowledge a
mutual connection.  Objectifying something is harmful for us and for
them.
- Rather than be suspicious (hermeneutics of suspicion), which
  projects an agential/subjective presence, we ought to dwell in a
  hermeneutics of wonder, of knowing things through intellectual and
  aesthetic exercises, which motivate fascination (action?) rather
  than critique.
- Everything is really an assemblage. Your brain is not “you”, but a
  collection of processes that are engaging with a bunch of other
  processes to form “you”. This is the connection to the swarm. A
  bunch of things are vitalized, and therefore acting in tandem like a
  swarm.

*** Moten, Fred and Stefano Harney. *The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study*, 2013. Epub.
- The university is dedicated to re-producing and perpetuating the
  oppressive and hierarchical orders of society. This cannot be
  overcome, so one ought to sneak into the university and steal what
  one can. You can be in but not of the university.
- How can one be inside of the system and yet resist the system? We
  can do it by forging connections that are outside of the established
  “connections”. In other words, by stealing, by feeling each other,
  by collecting debt, never paying it off, by collective study.
    - "The undercommons is a fugitive network where a commitment to
      abolition and collectivity prevails over a university culture
      bent on creating socially isolated individuals whose academic
      skepticism and claims of objectivity leave the world as it is
      intact.”
- We are broken, but cannot be repaired. All we can do is study,
  collect debt, and join in the shipped. Study is a mode of thinking
  with others, an assemblage. Debt is a state of being that we
  acknowledge but do not attempt to have repaired. We are always
  building debt, never paying it off. The shipped is where we all are,
  thrown in together, touching each other, feeling through each other,
  each other’s feels.

  describes how the internet helped the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico,
  the necessity of remote Twitter users to organize medical supplies
  during Arab Spring, the refusal to use bullhorns in the Occupy
  Movement that started in New York.
- There is inherent capacity (practical capacity) and signal capacity
  (potential capacity), such as promises and threats. Occupy vs
  SOPA/PIPA.
- While adhocracy, facilitated by horizontalism, allows for movements
  to improvise to meet immediate needs, tactical freeze is a potential
  disruption, an inability to advocate for policies or demands, moves
  requiring consensus and organization that is antithetical to the
  horizontal and improvisational structure of adhocracy.
In such an environment, information and misinformation glut is a real
problem, as the important information gets diluted or obscured. Today,
gatekeeping is done by governments, algorithms, platforms.

- The hypertext format engages the postmodern

  the multiplicity and instability of meaning in texts, as well as new
  radical conceptions of authorship
- The hypertext is postmodern; hypertext destabilizes the apparently
  stable, it creates new centers, new tangents, new connections in
  between textual elements.

*** Tenen, Dennis. *Plain Text: the Poetics of Computation*, 2017. Epub.
- Points out that each digital text carries with it a layer of hidden
  information that determines the display and dissemination of the
  document. Argues that we need to examine this layer to see how they
  also determine the way we engage with and interpret the
  document. There are underlying structures of power in copyright,
  surveillance, sharing, and modifying text, which is visible only in
  plain text.
    - Such media turns us into consumers rather than producers of
      media. Text that is highly restricted in its encoding threatens
      our critical ability.
        - Tenen proposes a microanalysis, computational poetics, or an
          archaeology of platforms and infrastructures (behind surface
          content). He points out what elides our notice about these
          media---that signs are fractured from their inscription (we
          do not experience how the sign is processed by the
          computer); and that mediation between human and machine
          becomes less and less accessible (eventually, we will be
          able to navigate interfaces with our minds). We don’t engage
          directly with the textual conduit, so we need to perform a
          media archaeology in order to have access to these processes
          and be in charge of them.
- Shows one cynical consequence of Landow’s argument. Instead of
  opening up the meaning of the text, of its dynamicity inviting more
  interpretations, Tenen points out that dynamicity can actually
  impose restrictions on interpretation. The text on the screen
  actually hides the ways in which it is already determined.
- Another interesting complication with the question of affect. Here,
  Tenen points out how pleasure in reading can actually be a bad
  thing, can evacuate the critical processes of interpretation.  → on
  the one hand, we have the pleasure of intuitive interfaces and on
  the other, a short circuiting of critical ability. How does the
  collapsing/obscuring of mediation between us and our texts affect
  the way we read them?

*** Fisher, Caitlin. *These Waves of Girls*, 2001. Web.
- The profusion of hyperlinks frustrates the reader by offering too
  many narrative paths. The reader’s frustration in navigating through
  the hypertext relates to the work’s theme of sexual discovery. In
  following the narrator as she develops her sexuality, the reader
  experiences her own cycles of desire and frustration.
- The reader’s narrative path parallels the theme of sexual discovery.
Additionally, the reader’s narrative desire for closure is related to
her sexual desire for release. Narrative/sexual desire conflation.
    - The desire to write is the desire to fool you, seduce you.”
- The links are associative, they elaborate the linked terms by
  leading to a single lexia or to another narrative. They can
  illuminate, echo, or answer another link or lexia. Sometimes we end
  up in the middle of another narrative. Sometimes we circle back to
  the same lexia.
    - FOR example, within the “I have always engaged with impossible
      comparisons” we click through the arrows to a lexia, “at seven,”
      which has a link, they'd put their hands on my thigh at the
      movies, which in fact leads to “Grade two,” another story about
      the time that an a man fondled the Tracey’s leg at the
      movies. We have a series of options on this story, and I click
      the link “the theatre was so dark,” which leads me to a
      recollection of a night picking fireflies. I click through the
      arrows, reading through Tracey’s fond and precious memory. The
      final lexia in this series has a link, “Do they dream about
      little girls the way I dream about them?” It seems to be
      referring to the older man (not the fireflies).
- We are always losing context. We read fragments of what was
  previously written. There is no guidance, the reader decides how to
  move at every point. It’s all about agency.

*** Rockwell, Geoffrey and Stefan Sinclair. *Voyant-Tools*. 2018. Web.
- Voyant Tools is a web application, developed out of earlier
  iterations by Stéfan Sinclair (McGill University) and Geoffrey
  Rockwell (University of Alberta). It functions as a one-stop-shop
  for text analysis, offering an easy to use interface that processes
  text in seconds, organizing it into a series of interactive lists,
  charts, graphs, and networks.
- facilitates:
    - *Praxis as an Hermeneutic* -- The tool’s primary interface on
      the homepage obscures its documentation to prioritize
      experimentation over discourse. The blank text box, accompanied
      by the mysterious “Reveal” button, prompts exploration, where
      users are invited to jump in without fully knowing how the tool
      functions, foregrounding the role that ignorance plays in
      discovering unforeseen elements about the text.
    - *Speculation* -- Using text-analysis in this way inspires new
      readings by bringing to light neglected, miniscule, or concealed
      aspects about texts. The defamiliarization of what we think we
      know leads us to speculate about other possibilities, and
      experience more active and playful approaches to inquiry.

** Media
*** Kittler, Friedrich. *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter*, 1999. Print and PDF.
Asks what if media determined our thought?
- Whereas, before the 20th century, media passed through symbolism
  (written signifier), now it is stored as physical traces in sound
  waves and light. Soon though, all media will lose its specificity,
  will become streams of numbers, reduced to surface effects (the
  interface).
- For electronic writing specifically, this evacuates the necessity
  for “hallucination”:
    - “As long as the book was responsible for all serial data flows,
      words quivered with sensuality and memory. It was the passion of
      all reading to hallucinate meaning between lines and letters…
      once memories and dreams, the dead and ghosts, became
      technically reproducible, readers and writers no longer needed
      the powers of hallucination” (10).
- Tells us to find pleasure in the circuits:
    - “What remains is what media can store and communicate. What
      counts are not the messages or the content with which they equip
      so-called souls for the duration of a technological era, but
      rather (and in strict accordance with McLuhan) their circuits,
      the very schematism of perceptibility. Whosoever is able to hear
      or see the circuits in the synthesized sound of CDs or in the
      laser storms of a disco finds happiness” (xl-xli).
- We had no way to record orality---which is prior to writing---until
  after the “monopoly of writing” had ended. Current and prior sense
  perceptions elided by present technology may in the future come to
  be recorded and felt. So this opens up possibilities for fiber
  optics.
    - “What will soon end in the monopoly of bits and fiber optics
      began with the monopoly of writing” (4). What will come of the
      monopoly of bits and fiber?

- In *House of Leaves*, the remediated narrator evacuates

      illusion of immaterial behavior.
    - “Whereas forensic materiality rests upon the potential for

      an abstract projection supported and sustained by its capacity
      to propagate the illusion (or call it a working model) of
      immaterial behavior: identification without ambiguity,
      transmission without loss, repetition without originality” (11).

- “At one and the same time, 21stC media broker human access to a
  domain of sensibility that has remained largely invisible (though

  sensibility since very individual act of access is itself a new
  datum of sensation that will expand the world incrementally but in a
  way that intensifies worldly sensibility” (6, emphasis original)

- Hansen’s central intervention on Whitehead’s thought, arguing that,
  while technology expands the scope for human perception across new
  sensory environments, it also limits the human’s immediate sensory
  experience of the world. Mark Hansen offers a provocative framework
  for thinking about human engagement with twenty-first-century
  media. It is precisely this exchange between direct and indirect
  perception that changes my reading of Woolf’s short story. First, on
  a material level, the edition expands the reader’s access to the
  text across time, while marginalizing her direct engagement with the
  witnesses as physical, time-bound objects, as actual books. This
  tension between the physical and virtual in the edition provokes a
  further implication on the level of narrative, which complicates
  Matz’s reading of perceptual unities that drive the
  narration. Allowing us to expand our perceptual capacities to things
  we might not directly feel but nonetheless experience, the edition
  opens up a reading of time as an agent in the story.
- In contrast to the beginning of the story, which locates the action
  in the past, the interruption here locates the narration in the
  present, unfolding action, which then leads to a final statement in
  the past tense. These ambiguities and mergings signal the important
  role that time plays in mediating the story itself, and especially,
  in bringing it to a close.

- Greg-Bowers-Tanselle are against the tyranny of the copy-text, and
  think we should be making eclectic editions, being careful and
  deliberate about our choice and judgment of substantive elements.
- The textual object is merely a vessel for the text, which is
  necessarily corrupted in its physical form.
    - “Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without
      questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral
      text of it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible
      on paper or in sound waves. … [In fact,] its medium is neither
      visual nor auditory. The medium of literature is the words
      (whether already existent or newly created) of a language; and
      arrangements of words according to the syntax of some language
      (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses or
      punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are
      reported by voice or in writing” (16-17).
- His attention to medium of words and paper elides medium of
  thought---as if the mind is pure thought, not an embodied process.
- The way he presents the central dilemma of textual
  criticism----either we pass down what we receive or we correct
  it---is ultimately conservative and oppressive. How do we maintain
  without perpetuating? Or recover without overwriting or determining?
  In other words, how can we open rather than constrain or delimit
  meaning?

  features. He says we need to promote new knowledge. We need a
  history of misreading:
    - “Any history of the book---subject as books are to typographic
      and material change---must be a history of misreadings. This is
      not so strange as it might sound. Every society rewrites its
      past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have any
      continuing life at all, at some point every printer redesigns
      them” (25).
- The tree structure, the trunk being the ideal text (never realized,
  only hinted at), and the branches being the florid witnesses. The
  book is never a single object, but a product of a number of human
  agencies and mechanical techniques that are historically
  situated. The trunk is the source, the animating principle (the
  “text”) that flows into the branches, witnesses. All these witnesses
  imply an ideal form never fully realized.

*** McGann, Jerome. *Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web*, 2001. Print.
- McGann introduces the term “quantum poetics” to indicate the
  volatile potentiality for meaning contained in every element of a
  literary text. He explains that:
    - “Aesthetic space is organized like quantum space, where the
      ‘identity’ of the elements making up the space are perceived to
      shift and change, even reverse themselves, when measures of
      attention move across discrete quantum levels” (184).
- IOW, the meaning of particular words in a literary text depends upon
  a multitude of factors, from antecedent readings and pathways
  through that text, to the significance of immanent elements such as
  typography and blank spaces, all of which the reader can only
  process a limited amount.
In its potentiality, McGann asserts, “Every page, even a blank page…
is n-dimensional.” Spatial units are opportunities for non-lexical
expression.
- Science vs Poetry
    - He clarifies that there is a difference between
      editorial/archival projects (which treat text as information)
      and hermeneutic/analytical projects that treat the reading
      process and interpretation (treat text as recursive aesthetic
      elements). Though our current tools, SGML/TEI, serve
      informational purposes, McGann is excited about the potential of
      XML (TEI, SGML). Hypertext exists before the web.  We need tools
      that function as prosthetic extensions.
    - SGML cannot capture poetics, “the recursive patterns that
      constitute an essential… feature of poetry” (172).

- Uses encoding as a method of teaching close reading in the English
  classroom. “The painstaking process of selecting bits of text and
  wrapping them with tags reframed reading as slow, iterative, and
  filled with formal choices."
- Encoding brings us to rethink our strategies/tools for close
  reading:
    - “Their decisions about which structures and information to tag
      very much determine what they value in a document—or at least
      what should be preserved and codified for other readers.”
    - “Since TEI is, at heart, an analytical and descriptive language
      for the humanities, it might encourage us to rethink which
      labels, categories, and values are essential in contemporary
      literary criticism and which terms may be unhelpfully
      ideological in our efforts to analyze literary texts.”

- This is an application of McGann’s comments about
  incommensurability. The TEI won’t allow them to assign multiple
  genders to one identity, in order to mark a mid-text gender shift.
- The questioning of the computer leads to the questioning of gender!
Can computational models ever capture such taxonomic chaos of gender
ontology? AND “Can ontologies ever capture the complex, multi-layered,
dynamic nature of gender identities?”
- We don’t need a solution. We need a way of showing dynamicity while
  still being findable. The issue with ontology should remain
  unresolved. That confusion is part of the experience of gender and
  sexuality in the modernist era. They ended up with a storm cloud,
  showing clusters of different gender traits over time.

** Critical Race
*** Tara McPherson’s “U.S. Operating Systems at Mid-Century: The
  Intertwining of Race and UNIX," Race After The Internet, ed. Lisa
Nakamura and Peter A. Chow-White. Routledge, 2012. 

Draws a parallel narrative between mid-twentieth century so called
liberal progressivist movements---race relations and technological
innovations leading up to the Operating System UNIX. She finds
similarities in the two, that both adhere to certain values which work
to cordone off parts of the system into distinct units. Does a deep
reading of UNIX philosophy, isolating concepts like modularity,
simplicity, transparency, and showing how these work to collapse or
erase complexity and context from computational systems. Just as overt
racism of the early 20th century becomes contained and perpetuated
through neoliberal plurualism, so do complex early machines become
compartmentalized and modularized in the development of the UNIX
operating system and it's children. The philosophy of UNIX systems
works across the social system to partition and compartmentalize
difference.

Tara McPherson’s “U.S. Operating Systems at Mid-Century”
- "I suggest that these two moments cut from time are deeply
  interdependent. In fact, they co-constitute one another, comprising
  not independent slices of history but, instead, related and useful
  lenses into the shifting epistemological registers driving U.S. and
  global culture in the 1960s and after. Both exist as operating
  systems of a sort, and we might understand them to be mutually
  reinforcing" (23).
- "As we delve into the intricacies of UNIX and the data structures it
  embraces, race in America recedes far from our line of vision and
  inquiry" (23).
- "what if this very incompatibility is itself part and parcel of the
  organization of knowledge production that operating systems like
  UNIX helped to disseminate around the world? Might we ask if there
  is not something particular to the very forms of electronic culture
  that seems to encourage just such a movement, a movement that
  partitions race off from the specificity of media forms?... might we
  argue that the very structures of digital computation develop at
  least in part to cordon off race and to contain it?" (24).
- "Certain modes of racial visibility and knowing coincide or dovetail
  with specific ways of organizing data" (24).
- "lenticular lenses", where "The viewer can rotate the card to see
  any single image, but the lens itself makes seeing the images
  together very difficult, even as it conjoins them at a structural
  level...serves to secure our understandings of race in very narrow
  registers, fixating on sameness or difference while forestalling
  connection and interrelation" (24-25).
- "A lenticular logic is a covert racial logic... A lenticular logic
  is a logic of the fragment or the chunk, a way of seeing the world
  as discrete modules or nodes, a mode that suppresses relation and
  context. As such, the lenticular also manages and controls
  complexity" (25).  --> (how does this engage with the discussion on
  Haraway's Situated Knowledges, on her championing the partial as
  objective?)
- "Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only
  where you must.... Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to
  make inspection and debugging easier... Rule of Representation: Fold
  knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust" (26).
- We "see at work here the basic contours of a lenticular approach to
  the world, an approach which separates object from context, cause
  from effect" (27). --> this is the place where modularity fails to
  account for context. Modularity needs a critical awareness of its
  own tools. Being modular in itself isn't bad, as long as you are
  aware of the ways that modularity creates limitations/reductions of
  data.
- "For instance, if the first half of the twentieth century laid bare
  its racial logics, from "Whites Only" signage to the brutalities of
  lynching, the second half increasingly hides its racial "kernel,"
  burying it below a shell of neoliberal pluralism" (29).
- "we might also understand the emergence of identity politics in the
  1960s as a kind of social and political embrace of modularity and
  encapsulation, a mode of partitioning that turned away from the
  broader forms of alliance-based and globally inflected political
  practice that characterized both labor politics and anti-racist
  organizing in the 1930s and 1940s.5 While identity politics produced
  concrete gains in the world, particularly in terms of civil rights,
  we are also now coming to understand the degree to which these
  movements curtailed and shortcircuited more radical forms of
  political praxis, reducing struggle to fairly discrete parameters"
  (30).
- "Many of these shifts were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at
  distancing the overt racism of the past even as they contained and
  cordoned off progressive radicalism. The emergence of covert racism
  and its rhetoric of colorblindness are not so much intentional as
  systemic" (30).
- "we cannot read the logics of these systems and networks solely at
  the level of our screens. Capital is now fully organized under the
  sign of modularity. It operates via the algorithm and the database,
  via and processing. Our screens are cover stories, disguising deeply
  divided forms of both machine and human labor. We focus exclusively
  on them increas ingly to our peril" (34).
- "We must develop common languages that link the study of code and
  culture . We must historicize and politicize code studies. And,
  because digital media were born as much of the Civil Rights era as
  of the Cold War era (and of course these eras are one and the same),
  our investigations must incorporate race from the outset,
  understanding and theorizing its function as a "ghost in the digital
  machine"" (34).

*** Nelson, Alondra. “Future Texts.” Social Text 71, Vol. 20, No. 2,
  Summer 2002.

Talks about the way that blackness is constructed in media, which is anti-technology, anti-progress, because the popular notions of the digital elide anything embodied or marked as other. 

“Blackness in particular, is the anti-avatar of digital life. Blackness gets constructed as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress” (1).
→ the ideal of technology is to do away with the flesh, with the inconveniences of the flesh. 

“In the future the body won’t bother us any longer” (2). 
→ this idea from the posthuman, from the development of cybernetics, which extends the prioritization of rationality in the human. The mind over body, the mind that eventually won’t need a body. Which of course elides the ways that information is always embodied, is always situated. 

Promoting the invisibility, universality, bodilessness of the digital requires the othering of embodied differences. See Nakamura. 

*** Ruha Benjamin, Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, Polity Press, 2019. 

Talks about how technologies carry through historical prejudices about
blackness. Current society perpetuates racism by transforming it into
ever new tools, in this case, data gathering and surveillance, machine
learning.

technology extends racism and anti-Black violence, a paradigm she
calls “the New Jim Code”: “the employment of new technologies that
reflect and reproduce existing inequities but that are promoted and
perceived as more objective or progressive than the discriminatory
systems of a previous era” (5-6).

“Far from coming upon a sinister story of racist programmers scheming
in the dark corners of the web, we will find that the desire for
objectivity, efficiency, profitability, and progress fuels the pursuit
of technical fixes across many different social arenas. Oh, if only
there were a way to slay centuries of racial demons with a social
justice bat! But, as we will see, the road to inequity is paved with
technical fixes” (7).  

“The animating force of the New Jim Code is that tech designers encode
judgments into technical systems but claim that the racist results of
their designs are entirely exterior to the encoding process” (11-12).

“This field guide explores not only how emerging technologies hide,
speed up, or reinforce racism, but also how race itself is a kind of
technology – one designed to separate, stratify, and sanctify the many
forms of injustice experienced by members of racialized groups, but
one that people routinely reimagine and redeploy to their own ends”
(19).

This is meant as an extension of New Jim Crow, which argues that
current society perpetuates racism by criminalizing it, war on drugs,
mass incarceration. It diverts racist action into new forms. The
newest form of this diversion is technology.

“Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be
unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape
responsibility for your role in an unjust system” (2).

“With emerging technologies we might assume that racial bias will be
more scientifically rooted out. Yet, rather than challenging or
overcoming the cycles of inequity, technical fixes too often reinforce
and even deepen the status quo” (3).

“the language of “progress” is too easily weaponized against those who
suffer most under oppressive systems” (4).

“These tech advances are sold as morally superior because they purport
to rise above human bias, even though they could not exist without
data produced through histories of exclusion and discrimination” (5).

“The animating force of the New Jim Code is that tech designers encode
judgments into technical systems but claim that the racist results of
their designs are entirely exterior to the encoding process” (6).  

→ are tools good or bad in themselves? I have believed in the past that
tools can be used in good or bad ways. That it was about agency,
activity, discovery, performance. But it seems that tools themselves
contain biases. What is the role of human agency in using biased
tools?

“this text presents a case for understanding race itself as a kind of
tool – one designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice as part
of the architecture of everyday life” (9).g

“The view that “technology is a neutral tool” ignores how race also
functions like a tool, structuring whose literal voice gets embodied
in AI. In celebrating diversity, tokenistic approaches to tech
development fail to acknowledge how the White aesthetic colors AI. The
“blandness” of Whiteness that some of my students brought up when
discussing their names is treated by programmers as normal, universal,
and appealing” (15).

-> white people want tech to make them invisible. The opposite impulse
has to employ the body, prioritize the marked body. Make the body
hypervisible and open to vulnerability.

→ Wendy Chun’s image of the window. The screen goes both ways. You are
already being seen when you use technology.

“Thin description” --- like surface reading, because we are all judged
by appearances. 23-24.  

“If the New Jim Code seeks to penetrate all areas of life, extracting
data, producing hierarchies, and predicting futures, thin description
exercises a much needed discretion, pushing back against the
all-knowing, extractive, monopolizing practices of coded inequity”
(24).

*** Simone Browne, Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of
Blackness. Duke University Press, 2015. 

“the conditions of blackness as a key site through which surveillance
is practiced, narrated, and resisted” “For this study, I look to
Pamela Z’s multimedia project on travel and security, Baggage
Allowance; Adrian Piper’s What It’s Like, What It Is #3; Caryl
Phillips’s epistolary story “The Cargo Rap” on prisons, politics, and
slavery; and Hank Willis Thomas’s commentary on branding and the
afterlife of slavery in his B®anded series. Part of the argument
presented here is that with certain acts of cultural production we can
find performances of freedom and suggestions of alternatives to ways
of living under a routinized surveillance” (6).

“The concept of dark matter might bring to mind opacity, the color
black, limitlessness and the limitations imposed on blackness, the
dark, antimatter, that which is not optically available, black holes,
the Big Bang theory, and other concerns of cosmology where dark matter
is that nonluminous component of the universe that is said to exist
but cannot be observed, cannot be re- created in laboratory
conditions. Its distribution cannot be measured; its properties cannot
be determined; and so it remains undetectable. The gravitational pull
of this unseen matter is said to move galaxies… In her essay “Black
(W)holes and the Geometry of Black Female Sexuality,” Evelyn Hammonds
takes up the astrophysics of black holes found in Michele Wallace’s
discussion of the negation of black creative genius to say that if “we
can detect the presence of a black hole by its effects on the region
of space where it is located,” where, unseen, its energy distorts and
disrupts that around it, from that understanding we can then use this
theorizing as a way to “develop reading strategies that allow us to
make visible the distorting and productive effects” of black female
sexualities in particular, and blackness in general.19 Taking up
blackness in surveillance studies in this way, as rather unperceived
yet producing a productive disruption of that around it, Dark Matters
names the surveillance of blackness as often unperceivable within the
study of surveillance, all the while blackness being that nonnameable
matter that matters the racialized disciplinary society. It is from
this insight that I situate Dark Matters as a black diasporic,
archival, historical, and contemporary study that locates blackness as
a key site through which surveillance is practiced, narrated, and
enacted” (9).  

-> So we have a paradigm of optics here, that allows us to see how the
whiteness and blackness engage visibly. Whiteness is the assumed
universal, unmarked and in that sense invisible (Nelson). Blackness is
also invisible, in the sense that it’s not readily perceived, but it’s
visible in its distortions, how it affects the objects surrounding
it. The tasks is to “develop reading strategies that allow us to make
visible the distorting and productive effects” of blackness (Browne
9). 

Racializing surveillance: “my use of the term “racializing
surveillance” signals those moments when enactments of surveillance
reify boundaries, borders, and bodies along racial lines, and where
the outcome is often discriminatory treatment of those who are
negatively racialized by such surveillance” (16).

Sousveillance: ““sousveillance” as a way of naming an active inversion
of the power relations that surveillance entails. Sousveillance, for
Mann, is acts of “observing and recording by an entity not in a
position of power or authority over the subject of the veillance,”
often done through the use of handheld or wearable cameras”55 (19).
“I use the term “dark sousveillance” as a way to situate the tactics
employed to render one’s self out of sight, and strategies used in the
flight to freedom from slavery as necessarily ones of
undersight. Using this model, but imagining Mann’s Veillance Plane as
operating in three dimensions, I plot dark sousveillance as an
imaginative place from which to mobilize a critique of racializing
surveillance, a critique that takes form in antisurveillance,
countersurveillance, and other freedom practices” (21).

With runaway slaves, “how black performative practices and creative
acts (fiddling, songs, and dancing) also functioned as sousveillance
acts and were employed by people as a way to escape and resist
enslavement, and in so being were freedom acts” (22).

B®anding Blackness: Biometric Technology and the Surveillance of
Blackness [read in full] “branding during transatlantic slavery as a
marking, making, and marketing of blackness as commodity… the history
of branding in transatlantic slavery anticipates the “social sorting”
outcomes that Lyon’s work alerts us to regarding some contemporary
surveillance practices, including passports, identification documents,
or credit bureau databases. … contemporary biometric information
technologies and their applications: the fingerprint data template
technology and retina scans where the human body, or parts and pieces
of it, are digitized for automation, identification, and verification
purposes” (26).

“Biometric information technology, or biometrics, in its simplest
form, is a means of body measurement that is put to use to allow the
body, or parts and pieces and performances of the human body, to
function as identification” (91).

“Can the epidermal racial schema that Fanon makes plain be found in
some contemporary biometric information technologies—the iris scanners
and fingerprint readers that are said to secure borders and protect a
collective “us” from identity fraud and personal data theft?” (92).

“Blackness for Sale was a necessary counterframing to concurrent
net.art in that it critiqued the commodification of blackness and the
ways that colonial narratives are reproduced through Internet
interfaces: “While watching what many were doing with net.art, I
didn’t really see net artists dealing with this intersection of
commerce and race. I really wanted to comment on this odd Euro
colonialist narrative that exists on the web and black peoples’
position within that narrative. I mean, there are browsers called
Explorer and Navigator that take you to explore the Amazon or trade in
the ebay. It’s all just too blatant to ignore” (106).

“I suggest here that we come to think of the concept of digital
epidermalization when we consider what happens when certain bodies are
rendered as digitized code, or at least when attempts are made to
render some bodies as digitized code… facial recognition, iris and
retinal scans, hand geometry, fingerprint templates, vascular
patterns, gait and other kinesthetic recognition, and, increasingly,
DNA.” (109).  “Epidermalization—the imposition of race on the body”
(113).

Facial recognition stems from craniometry & phrenology: “With Li,
Zhou, and Geng’s study quoted above, we can see that pseudo-
scientific discourse of racial difference forms the theoretical basis
from which to develop a facial computational model that could qualify
(and mathematically quantify) difference to allow for identity
authentification…. Some advances in biometric information technology
are organized around the idea of digital epidermalization.” (112-113).

On cameras: “technology privileges whiteness, or at least lightness,
in its use of lighting and in the ways in which certain bodies are lit
and measured in the enrollment process” (Browne 113).

Branded: “The words “Pistol,” “Bullet,” and “Picking” are the only
ones that are capitalized in this image, signaling the link between
the labor of slavery (picking cotton) and its violent aftermath
(firearm- related homicide), and the ways in which black death is
capitalized upon (picking caskets). Debt (reparations for slavery,
credit card debt) underwrites Thomas’s remaking of MasterCard’s
Priceless campaign. With B®anded comes Thomas’s interrogation of
advertising and the commodification of blackness, urban violence, and
the transatlantic slave trade” (124).  

“When asked about the intent behind his B®anded series, Thomas has
said that he was “interested in the way that black men are the most
feared and revered bodies in the world in this weird way” and that he
was “trying to figure out why that was and what that was about, and
the relationship to slavery and commodity, which is commerce, culture,
cotton, and that body type.”116” (125).  

“blackness is pitched “as a way to cash in on street cool or urban
icon”” (125).

in this article I question the stability of what has been or can be
categorized as data, the uses the idea of data has been put to, and the stakes underlying data’s implicit claim to stability or objectivity” (58).

“Black digital practice is the revelation that black subjects have
themselves taken up science, data, and coding, in other words, have commodified themselves and digitized and mediated their own black freedom dreams, in order to hack their way into systems (whether modernity, science, or the West), thus living where they were ‘never meant to survive.’” (59).

“From blogs and journals built on fourth-generation hypertext markup
language (HTML) guided by cascading style sheets (CSS) to databases using extensible markup language (XML) and standard query language (SQL), scholars using digital tools mark up the bodies and requantify the lives of people of African descent” (59).

“There is nothing neutral, even in a digital environment, about doing
histories of slavery, and technology has not made the realities of bondage any more palatable or easier to discuss across audiences or platforms. Exploring these anxieties in analog and digital form exposes an unsettled relationship among data, slavery’s archive, and the impulse to commodify black life… The legacy of commodifying black bodies and truncating black life infuses and informs digital design and execution” (60).

“In slaving conventions along the African coast, in slave traders’
desire to transform women and youth into units of measurement, in the symbolic and reproductive labor enslaved African women would be forced to perform, compilers of slave ship manifests participated in the transmutation of black flesh into integers and fractions” (65).

“Operating in the interstices between listservs and blogging
platforms, social media users have exploded nineteenth-century codes of race and eighteenth-century denominations of color, defying naturalized assumptions of race, sexuality, gender, and gender presentation through promiscuous use of avatars, changing pseudonyms and nicknames and even deleting or reviving user accounts at will… From the personal to the political, from the embodied to the spiritual, from the human to the community, black digital practice charts a path against the drive for data. It curates the mourning, dissembles against the plantation impulse, and, in the break, absconds” (69-70).

“Black digital practice offers a corrective. It attends to black
subjects who scream in spite, because, and in defiance of their own ritual murder. Black digital practice requires researchers to witness and remark on the marked and unmarked bodies, the ones that defy computation, and finds ways to hold the null values up to the light” (70-71).

“As a digital humanist, I witness something happening in digital media, social media, online activism, and hashtag activism that hearkens back in time to screams in the archive, jokes in the face of death, to black cultural production and acts of resistance. “History,” Saidiya Hartman writes, “is how the secular world attends to the dead.” Histories of slavery offer digital humanists a cautionary tale, a lesson in the kind of death dealing that happens when enumerating, commodifying, and calculating bodies becomes naturalized. Doing truly embodied and data-rich histories of slavery requires similarly remixing conceptual, discursive, and archival geographies, with deliberate, pained intimacy, and, likely, some violence. But black digital practice challenges slavery scholars and digital humanists to feel this pain and infuse their work with a methodology and praxis that centers the descendants of the enslaved, grapples with the uncomfortable, messy, and unquantifiable, and in doing so, refuses disposability” (71).

** Queer DH
*** Keeling, Kara. "Queer OS." Cinema Journal, vol. 53 no. 2, 2014,
p. 152-157. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/cj.2014.0004.

--> Queer OS is about recognizing the oppressive structures that
enable computation, and working within, through, against those
structures to create new social relationships.

“Queer OS would take historical, sociocultural, conceptual phenomena
that currently shape our realities in deep and profound ways, such as
race, gender, class, citizenship, and ability (to name those among the
most active in the United States today), to be mutually constitutive
with sexuality and with media and information technologies, thereby
making it impossible to think any of them in isolation. It understands
queer as naming an orientation toward various and shifting aspects of
existing reality and the social norms they govern, such that it makes
available pressing questions about, eccentric and/or unexpected
relationships in, and possibly alternatives to those social norms”
(153).

“an aim of Queer OS vis-à-vis conceptualizations of commons is to
provide a society-level operating system (and perhaps an operating
system that can run on computer hardware) to facilitate and support
imaginative, unexpected, and ethical relations between and among
living beings and the environment, even when they have little, and
perhaps nothing, in common” (154).

"/queer/ offers a way of  making perceptible presently uncommon senses
in the interest of  producing a/new commons and/or of  proliferating
the senses of  a commons already in the making" (153).

"Inspired by McPherson’s analysis of Unix in the context of US racial
formation, Queer OS seeks to make /queer/ into the logic of “an
operating system of a larger order” that unsettles the common senses
that secure those presently hegemonic social relations that can be
characterized by domination, exploitation, oppression, and other
violences" (154).

"Queer OS names a way of thinking and acting with, about, through,
among, and at times even in spite of new media technologies and other
phenomena of media-tion. It insists upon forging and facilitating
uncommon, irrational, imaginative, and/or unpredictable relationships
between and among what currently are perceptible as living beings and
the environment in the interest of creating value(s) that facilitate
just relations.  

/Because Queer OS ideally functions to transform material relations,
it is at odds with the logics embedded in the operating systems
McPherson discusses/

Because it seeks to undermine the relationships secured through those
logics, even as, like McPherson does when she points out that she is
using a computer and word-processing software that shape her own
intellectual work in specific ways, it acknowledges its own
imbrication with and reliance on those logics while still striving to
forge new relationships and connections" (154).

- Facebook doesn’t care how you identify, but only that your
  identification is addressable by them. “The move by Facebook
  allowing for the selection of multiple genders “remain[s] deeply
  tied to a kind of binary logic, or at the very least a digital
  one. Put simply, while Facebook gave users more gender options with
  which to identify, they were still engaging in an act of
  identification... Here the user has simply been conscripted into
  enacting the labor of identification once reserved for sophisticated
  algorithms” (1).
- New systems enact compulsory identification, they do not care how
  you identify, they only care that you have an identification that is
  addressable by them. So, What are queer modes of being within
  technological systems, modes that refuse the gesture of capture and
  extraction?
- The NULL marker in SQL offers a way of becoming that enacts a queer
  logic that is explicitly situated within the logic of information
  systems but refuses this gesture of capture and extraction. A
  “refusal to cohere, to become legible.” “The use of NULL thus marks
  an indeterminate mode of being that is at once within and outside,
  part of and illegible to a discrete system of relations, a “middle”
  that explicitly marks an indeterminate, incalculable, unknown state
  of being” (11).

- Intervention in Empiricism--following the skepticism of empiricism
  to its logical end, which is that we only know our sense
  impressions, nothing more (though he ultimately recommends a middle
  way that is more practical and psychologically possible). The
  important thing is that Hume, in my list, inaugurates the absolute
  reliance on evidence that appears in many of the critics who pursue
  more "objective", "falsifiable", or "verifiable" modes of
  criticism. However, as it turns out, according to Hume, the total
  reliance on evidence then turns reason into something that is
  speculative---more like guesswork than causal. Our reason assumes
  causality and connections between sense perceptions. Hume calls this
  assumption a "custom" or "habit of thought", but I prefer to think
  of it as a speculation or conjecture.a

*** William James. Selected essays including “The Sentiment of Rationality,” (PDF) and "Stream of Thought," (Web) circa 1890.
- Reason is feeling, "sentiment of rationality", of things being
  either connected or distinguished.
    - The "Aesthetic Principle of Ease" --- finding a unity in chaos
      or drawing simplicity from complexity creates a pleasurable
      sensation. Our powers of rationality are thus attributed to a
      feeling that things make sense. The ignoring of data is the most
      popular way of attaining unity in thought.
    - There is also a pleasure in making distinctions, in exploring
      how things are different from each other. This is "the passion
      of distinguishing", being acquainted with the parts rather than
      the whole.
- Language cannot articulate feelings, it can only articulate images,
  resting places of feelings. But language can cast a halo, a feeling
  of tendency, which dies in the moment of its full articulation. This
  is why grammatical forms such as conjunctions and prepositions are
  so important.
    - Thought is not chopped up in bits, but it flows. In this flow,
      there are two kinds of "thought" in the stream of thought---the
      substantive and the transitive. The substantive are the images,
      resting places, "sensorial imaginations"; the transitive is the
      relation between the substantive, the in-betweens, places of
      flight, which James describes as tendencies, fringes, halos. Our
      goal is to get from one resting place to the next. We cannot,
      however, stop to examine the transitive like we can the
      substantive. Stopping to look at them is either impossible,
      because we are brought with such force along the thought toward
      the substantive, or annihilating, because when we stop it, it
      ceases to be what itself. "If we try to hold fast the feeling of
      direction, the full presence comes and the feeling of direction
      is lost" (244-5). All we get are "rapid premonitory perspective
      views of schemes of thought not yet articulate" (244-5).
    - Language struggles to articulate the experience of the
      transitive, because in language, our thoughts are tethered to
      the form of the sentence and to the meaning of words, which
      names things simply, as if these are not dimly connected to many
      other things. There are unarticulated affinities surrounding
      words.
        - For example, the sensation of hearing thunder also includes
          the sensation of contrast between thunder and its preceding
          silence. 'Thunder-breaking-upon-the-silence-and-contrasting-with-it'---
          This creates a quality, or feeling, where the sensation of
          thunder also includes the silence just gone.
        - Another example is the way we use syntactic
          structures---particularly conjunctions, prepositions,
          adverbial phrases---and vocal inflections, which present
          some shading and nuance of our experience not directly
          expressible in language. We should talk about the halos or
          feelings/tendencies that surround conjunctions such as "and"
          "but" "or"---"a feeling of and", "a feeling of but".
        - "Nonesense in grammatical form sounds half rational" (255)
          --> Gertrude Stein!

*** Bergson, Henri. *Matter and Memory*, 1896.
- Memory has to do with storage and access---we recreate sensations
  from memory.
Perception is a site of resistance against stimuli---the body is the
surface where light is cast.
- The way that empiricists up to now misunderstand how memory
  works---it is a dynamic process that engages the present,
  re-creating the present in the body. External stimuli trigger
  memories of mental or motor states. Cerebral activity causes certain
  perceptions, and the brain can prolong them in the form of a
  recollection: “It is true that, from the moment when the
  recollection actualises itself in this manner, it ceases to be a
  recollection and becomes once more a perception” (240). But it’s not
  clear exactly what causes these recollections; without an external
  stimulus they would seem arbitrary.
    - Bergson uses the image of the keyboard to describe how sensation
      and memory are linked: "This organ [of sense] is constructed
      precisely with a view to allowing a plurality of simultaneous
      excitants to impress it in a certain order and in a certain way,
      by distributing themselves, all at one time, over selected
      portions of its surface. It is like an immense keyboard, on
      which the external object executes at once its harmony of a
      thousand notes, thus calling forth in a definite order, and at a
      single moment, a great multitude of elementary sensations
      corresponding to all the points of the sensory centre that are
      concerned" (165).
- Our perception only captures so much, the rest outruns us. The spot
  of light on the wall:
    - "The luminous point gives rise to a virtual image which
      symbolizes, so to speak, the fact that the luminous rays cannot
      pursue their way. Perception is just a phenomenon of the same
      kind. That which is given is the totality of the images of the
      material world, with the totality of their internal
      elements....The objects merely abandon something of their real
      action in order to manifest their virtual action" (29-30).
    - "We seize, in the act of perception, something which outruns
      perception itself, although the material universe is not
      essentially different or distinct from the representation which
      we have of it... Matter thus resolves itself into numberless
      vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted continuity, all
      bound up with each other, and travelling in every direction like
      shivers through an immense body" (276).

*** Whitehead, Alfred North. Modes of Thought, 1938.
- Language fails to express the fullness of experience because it is
  an abstraction.
    - This is why philosophy needs poetry. "Language halts behind
      intuition. The difficulty of philosophy is the expression of
      what is self-evident. Our understanding outruns the ordinary
      usages of words. Philosophy is akin to poetry. Philosophy is the
      endeavour to find a conventional phraseology for the vivid
      suggestiveness of the poet" (68-9).
    - Single words and single sentences make us think that things can
      be fully abstracted, which is an illusion.
    - We ought to pay more attention to conjunctions: "the little word
      'and' is a nest of ambiguity. It is very astounding how slight
      has been the analysis of the ambiguities of words expressive of
      conjunctions. Such words are the death-traps for accuracy of
      reasoning. Unfortunately, they occur abundantly in sentences,
      expressed in the most perfect literary form. Thus an admirable
      literary style is no security for logical consistency" (74).
- Process philosophy, rather than one of being, means that everything
  we perceive is constantly in motion. Whitehead’s concept of
  “prehension” exhibits how perception relies on data seizure and
  speculation. Rather than conceive matter at an instant, Whitehead’s
  process of prehension attends to data in the unfolding process of
  pulsation in order to apprehend matter in its complexity,
  interconnectedness, and possibility. This all occurs in a process,
  not an instant. The potentiality of data, rather than data at an
  instant, forms the basis for all thought:
    - “If the universe be interpreted in terms of static actuality,
      then potentiality vanishes. Everything is just what it
      is. Succession is mere appearance, rising from the limitation of
      perception. But if we start with process as fundamental, then
      the actualities of the present are deriving their characters
      from the process, and are bestowing their characters upon the
      future. Immediacy is the realization of the potentialities of
      the past, and is the storehouse of the potentialities of the
      future. Hope and fear, joy and disillusion, obtain their meaning
      from the potentialities essential in the nature of things”
      (136).

*** Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. The Phenomenology of Perception, 1945.
- Our perception/body cannot extricate itself from the world in order
  to be conscious of that world. It weaves together the real and the
  imaginary.
- Proposes an extended cognition based on the body.
    - The objective world doesn't exist apart from our subjective
      perspective of it. We become part of what we see.
    - Our body is "being-toward-the-world", a pre-objective
      orientation. The subject is relentlessly embroiled in her
      surroundings, which she cannot extricate herself from. "The real
      is a closely woven fabric", made up of colors, noises,
      sensations, daydreams. Our body is in the world, extending
      toward the world, like a heart in a body.

*** Nagel, Thomas. "What is it like to be a bat?" 1974. 
- Against the physical and material reductions of mind to matter. We
  cannot understand consciousness just by looking at the brain,
  because it actually involves subjective experiences, qualia, that
  elude our imaginations and approximations. We are limited to the
  first person perspective, and cannot broach the third. We cannot
  know what it's like for a bat to be a bat, only imagine what it's
  like for a human to have wings, sonar, etc. We cannot explain
  consciousness in objective terms.

*** Chalmers, David and Andy Clark. "The Extended Mind." 1998.
- The mind extends into the world. Touching objects is thinking with
  them, incorporating them into a larger cognitive process.
- Propose the idea of active externalism---that the mind is extended
  into objects in the environment, which form part of its cognitive
  processes.
- Touching things, manipulating them, referring to them is thinking
  with them. This engages with literary critics like Eve Sedgwick who
  propose affective modes of analysis. Our brains manipulate external
  media in art, books, culture, language. Perhaps we are evolving to
  do this more efficiently, like our use of language which allows us
  to make other intellectual developments.

*** Shaviro, Steven. *The Universe of Things: On Speculative Realism*, 2014.
- Rather than try to know things, we feel them. We can know things
  because we are constantly *becoming* (Whitehead) with them, and
  speculating about them.
- Another example of extended cognition, here it's called
  "noncorrelationalist", which is resists the idea of correlationism,
  descendent from modern philosophy, running through Descartes to
  Hume, that humans cannot know things outside their own experience of
  those things. For these thinkers, epistemology (what we know) is
  privileged to ontology (being). Rather than say we know things,
  Shaviro says that we feel them---experience is aesthetic rather than
  epistomologic. Aesthetics marks the place where traditional
  cognition and correlation are left behind---how we are compelled to
  speculate---"think outside our own thought".
- Though our reality always escapes us, we are nonetheless moved by
  it. What others experience eludes our correlational schemas, but we
  can try to approximate through the use of metaphor and
  simile---"aesthetic semblances". We have to assume panpsychism, that
  all organisms think (here resembles Nagel, though Nagel has less
  faith overall in the use of speculation).
    - "Things move us, force us to feel them" (8).
    - We have "non-correlational sentience"; our apprehension is a
      kind of "contact-at-a-distance", not a passive impression or
      mental intention, but an encounter that changes us, which cannot
      be connected to the properties of the object. "My encounter runs
      deeper than anything I can know about it" (118).
    - This is a kind of autistic thought. Autistics are fully immersed
      in their worlds.
    - "Aesthetics marks the place where cognition and correlation are
      left behind... aesthetics is the primordial form of experience"
      (155-56).

*** Hayles, Katherine N. Cognitive Unconscious, 2017. 
- Hayles proposes a "planetary cognitive ecology" extends the focus of
  ethical inquiry from humans to machines that operate with humans
  within larger "cognitive assemblages." Distinguishes cognition by
  interpretation or choice, rather than free will. This allows her to
  include machines in discussions about ethics.
- Cognition involves more than what we consciously recognize, and more
  than the unconscious. It is "unthought", or thinking without
  thinking, being in the eternal present and eluding the belated grasp
  of consciousness.
    - There are three layers to consciousness: higher consciousness
      (abstraction), nonconscious cognition (interpretation and
      choice), material processes (storms). Nonconscious cognition is
      inaccessible to our awareness, like neuronal processing,
      synthesizing sensory inputs so they appear consistent across
      time and space, finding patterns in chaos, keeping our
      consciousness from being overwhelmed.  --> there are N
      Dimensions for reading a page.
- Our cognition also operates with other technical systems to form
  "cognitive assemblages"---human technical interactions that operate
  collectively, in automated technical systems, for example. Often
  consist of low level processors or sensors which are connected to
  higher level processors that draw inferences or take actions /
  decisions. Like the traffic control in LA.

** Thinking/Feeling: Neuroscience
*** Varela, Francisco, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch. *The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience*, 1991.
- Building off Merleau-Ponty---the world isn't pregiven or
  representational, but enacted. The mind is a cognitive process that
  links sensory-motor perception to action.
- Cognition is not in the mind but enacted in the body and world,
  existing in relation to something in action. Perception becomes a
  process construction, not a mental representation. This allows
  Varella and Thompson to get out of the transcendental self or "I",
  in favor of an ego-less body in action.
- "Embodied cognition"---our thinking/experience relies on our body's
  sensory motor capacities that work in a constant, recursive way---we
  cannot separate sensory, motor, perceptive and cognitive capacities.

*** Damasio, Antonio. First chapter from *The Feeling of What Happens*, 2000 & *Self Comes to Mind*, 2010.
- Damasio wants to examine the explanatory gap (? neurons --> feelings
  ?) and how the brain generates consciousness. The idea of the self
  is crucial for any autonomous creature, and it was evolved from more
  primitive brains. Primal feelings, which arise from an evolutionary
  imperative in the brain stem, eventually leads to an
  "autobiographical self" to manage those feelings. Our feelings are
  vague because the mind deliberately obscures the inner workings of
  our mind/body so that we can focus on the world and solve immediate
  problems. (This is the same reason why machine inscription is
  displaced---all in the service of efficiency!) Damasio finds that
  consciousness is actually located in the upper brain stem, rather
  than cerebral cortex (Dahaene and LeDoux's positions).
- There are three layers to consciousness---the protoself, core
  consciousness, and extended consciousness---through which neural
  patterns filter upward to feelings. Our feelings are the basis of
  all our consciousness and reasoning, and they seem elusive because
  the higher mind filters out what is going on in the body and
  brain. Consciousness is when the mind notices the body's reaction, a
  feeling of awareness that arises from a feeling body, a body
  emoting.
    - First, *the protoself*--neural patterns that detect and record
      internal physical changes, maintain homeostais, mapping the
      current status of the body's responses to environmental changes.
    - Second, *core consciousness*--the organisim becomes aware of the
      changes occuring in the internal bodily state, developing a
      momentary sense of self, without language or memory.
    - Third, *extended consciousness*---consciousness moves beyond the
      present, begins to use language and memory (though these are not
      required), and the autobiographical self emerges.
    - Basically, neural patterns in the brain create mental images,
      which then float up into the organisim's
      awareness. Consciousness is when the organisism notices this
      feeling floating up.
        - networks/circuits/patterns of neurons -> representational
          maps of patterns -> images of maps -> feeling.
            - Our thoughts are felt because they originate from the
              brain stem, where body and brain are fused. Feelings are
              mental aspects of brain (neural) states. Damasio's idea
              of somatic markers---emotions in the body are associated
              with feelings, rapid heartbeat, for example.
            - Perception in the brain derives from a topography of the
              perceptual object. That topography then filters up into
              an image, a sensory image maybe tactile or auditory or
              visual, and then we get a feeling associated with that
              image (core consciousness). The recognition of that
              feeling is extended consciousness.
- Mental processes find parallels in computation:
    - In memory, the brain stores patterns of feeling and a formula to
      retrieve them and reproduce them. This is why we remember
      contexts over things.
        - RUBRIC: Recall: In memory, the brain creates a sensory map
          and plays it back. Descends form “disposition formula”, a
          command (if you are hit, move away), which was later
          appended with maps of sensory information. Used for storing
          images with directions to retrieve maps, rather than in
          “hard copy”. The way that we store and retrieve memory is
          "postmodern", in formulas that reactivate and reconstruct
          our sensorymotor maps, using existing perceptual machinery.
    - Simulations and hallucinations are recircuiting/tricking the
      brain to make a feeling.
    - Neurons are electrical and function through polarities.
        - RUBRIC: Neurons: Electrical and polarized; containing large
          charge differences between inside and outside. To fire, the
          difference is reduced, and depolarization advances down the
          axon like a wave. This wave is the electrical impulse.

*** Malabou, Catherine. Chapter from *What Should We Do with Our Brain?*, 2008.
- The way that contemporary neurosciences characterize brain
  plasticity as flexible, malleable, adaptable plays into late
  capitalist ideology that conceptualizes humans as self-controlled,
  autonomous, accountable in their labor. We should reconcieve brain
  plasticity as explosive, taking charge of our own malleability and
  resisting the status quo. This uses a traditionally negative affect,
  anger and rage, toward political effects.
    - Malabou approaches the brain as a historical/social product in
      which descriptions about its workings reflect political and
      economic practices and assumptions, such as discourses about
      management and organization in neo-capitalism. In this context,
      "plasticity" means flexibility, in which people are malleable,
      adaptable, and able to self-modify and self-control when
      needed. This is a shift from disciplinary society's top-down
      model of command to the society of control's idea of the
      networked, flexible, responsible, docile worker.
    - Malabou suggests that we shift our attention to a less popular
      designation of "plasticity" in order to subvert capitalist
      ends. We should attend to its meaning as "explosive"---"the
      capacity to annihilate form and create it anew." This is a shift
      from molding to deflagration, encouraging us to replace our
      tendency to adapt and accept with exploding (from time to time),
      re-learning how to enrage ourselves against a culture of
      docility.

*** Noe, Alva. *Out of Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain, and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness*, 2010.
- An proponent of the extended mind theory, the idea that
  consciousness is not something in our minds, neuronal, or in our
  bodies, embodied, but it's something that we do---enworlded and
  enacted.
- Noe says we do not embrace the extent of our own minds, how they
  reach out into the environment and are constructed in movement with
  that environment. The blind man's cane is really (not
  metaphorically) a part of him. Neurons are not the whole story, the
  mind includes our sense organs.
    - The example of ferrets who were rewired at birth, their eyes to
      the auditory parts of their brains. These neurons in the
      auditory section were repurposed for seeing, rather than the
      eyes for hearing. This demonstrates that something more than
      neurological processes are determining our experience. We have
      no idea how neurons lead to vision.
        - Contrast with LeDoux, who places vision squarely in the
          cerebral cortex.
- What does Noe's position gain by positing that the world is an
  extension of human consciousness?  That everything is ultimately a
  tool for human thinking? This anthopocentrism is ultimately harmful,
  as demonstrated by Hayles. It makes the human the center of ethical
  inquiry, obscuring other actors.

*** Dahaene, Stanislas. *Reading in the Brain: The New Science of How We Read*, 2010.
- Dahaene deals specifically with the problem of reading (and more
  broadly with the problem of culture). He questions how our brains
  have adapted to reading, given that they never evolved for it. He
  attempts an answer through the "neuronal recycling hypothesis"---we
  inherit certain brain cicuitry (like those used recognizing shapes
  by primates) and adapt them for reading. All writing systems share
  basic shapes, which are part of the primate visual system. The brain
  didn't evolve for culture, but culture evolved for the brain.
- Most of reading happens in unconscious processing. First, we get
  letters through saccades (10-12 letters at a time, .05 sections for
  eye scan), then the letters proceed through either words and/or
  sounds to meaning. The whole process from word to meaning takes
  about half a second.
    - Reading begins in the "letterbox" section of the brain, a visual
      processing center in the occipital lobe, which ascertains the
      word, then feeds this information up to other parts of the brain
      (temporal and parietal) that parse sound and meaning. Though we
      have managed to map several of the relevant brain areas using
      MRI, EEG, and PET scans, how meaning actually arises remains a
      mystery. How do neuronal networks suddenly snap together and
      make sense? The explanatory gap remains.
        - Reminds me of Gertrude Stein's finding patterns in letters
          and sounds rather than meaning.
- Computational metaphors for reading: Visual uptake (saccedes) and
  word recognition relies on massive parallel processing, but goes way
  beyond what OCR can do.

*** LeDoux, Joseph. Chapter from *Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety*, 2015.
- By examining what happens to the prefrontal and parietal cortices
  during vision, we find them necessary for consciousness. Whatever
  else is going on, the neocortex is necessary.
- LeDoux outlines the debate on what is necessary for consciousness or
  where it's primarily located--between the neocortex (LeDoux,
  Dahaene), subcortex (Damasio), beyond the brain in the body and/or
  environment (Noe, Varela & Thompson). For LeDoux, the hard part is
  explaining qualia, not how we process the colors of the sunset but
  how we experience those colors. He examines this problem through
  vision processing--what parts of the brain are engaged in processing
  and reporting on vision? Finds that the prefrontal and parietal are
  necessary for conscious vision, in reporting vision, but not when
  vision goes unreported.
    - --> The problem of qualia is where literature and philosophy
      come in.
- LeDoux goes over various information processing theories, all of
  which place the role of the subconscious/nonconscious/memory at
  different levels of remove from the conscious. The main disagreement
  is where all this nonconscious activity occurs and how it relates to
  our conscious activity.

*** Pitts-Taylor, Victoria. *The Brain's Body: Neuroscience and Corporeal Politics*, 2016.
- Bodily difference yields cognitive difference.
- Scientific conceptions of the brain occlude or naturalize social
  inequalities by studying the brain in isolation from power
  structures. Our brains are actually shaped by lived inequalities of
  race, gender, class, ability, sexuality. Neuroscientists often
  ignore how the brain is social, plastic, and embodied. Pitts-Taylor
  deconstructs these discourses disguised as biological truths,
  brining feminist, race, queer and disability theory to neuroscience.
- Theorists of embodied cognition do a good job situating cognition in
  bodies, but not in accounting for bodily difference. Mirror neurons
  are thought to enable empathy but actually they assume universal and
  normative accounts of embodiment, or "simulation", that can get in
  the way of intersubjective understanding. In creating vicarious
  states of action/feeling in the observer, mirror neurons project our
  own assumptions onto others. We cannot rely on simulation because
  our bodies are not the same. There are limits to
  identification---mirror neurons make misreadings.
    - --> compare this situation with Shaviro's discussion of
  aesthetic semblances.
- "Mis/fitting, then, is not a fixed condition or standpoint, nor a
social construction, but an encounter" (61).
- "Disability, then, inheres not in an individual body, nor in its
representation, but rather in a relation that is temporally and
spatially specific---a particular coupling of mind/body and
world. Mis/fittings are embodied events, assemblages of body-subjects
an worlds whose mis/fits are context- and interaction-dependant" (61).

*** Tougaw, Jason. *The Elusive Brain: Literary Experiments in the Age of Neuroscience*, 2018. 
- Unlike neuroscientists and philosophers who think it's either
  impossible or inevitable that we can solve the explanatory gap,
  literary theorists do not concern themselves with resolving the
  issue. Instead, they find great material for exploration within the
  explanatory gap. Literature is a mode that can usefully speculate
  beyond the explanatory gap to questions of qualia and
  selfhood. Brain narratives offer simulations of qualia, allowing us
  to ask questions about identity, social relations and embodiment
  that the laboratory sciences are not able to answer.  Neuronovelists
  dramatize epistemological questions without answering them, allowing
  us to feel the porousness of the explanatory gap.
- Science deals in hypothesis, literature in speculation. Both are
  "counterfactual---imaginging what we do not know"---but only
  literature dramatizes the debate without trying to resolve
  it. Literature substitutes particularity for reductionism,
  speculative worlds for hypothesis.
  - Narrative can go beyond science into the realm of speculation. Brain
    narratives experiment with literary conventions to explore the
    relationship between brain, body and world. What is the relationship
    between brain matter and the immaterial experiences that compose a
    self?  The point is to trace the traffic between the material and
    the immaterial, the ways that words mark us, trigger our emotions,
    memories, the aesthetic, affective experience.
  - The interplay of image and text in graphic narrative is an
    analogue to the "unraveling binary between physiology and
    subjectivity" (188). Graphic novels, more broadly, the
    levels of word and image create a meaning that is a
    subjective experience, just as consciousness is a subjective
    experience.
- Words are unstable, misreading is inevitable---the study of
  neuroscience (mirror neurons and reading) would benefit from
  embracing this instability.
  - "Aesthetic experience involves the inexplicable traffic between the
    material and the immaterial in ways that feel automatic and often go
    unnoticed. Words on a page, images on a screen, or sound vibrating
    from a speaker act upon the bodies of readers, spectators, and
    listeners and in the process trigger a spectrum of immaterial
    experiences—affective responses, acts of inspiration or imagination,
    emotions, desire, memory—whose physiological correlates, felt and
    unfelt, trigger still more immaterial experiences. And so on. In
    this sense, a form of “material interiority” is fundamental to the
    capacity for the aesthetic ‘transmission of affect’” (169).
  - “Mind reading—or mentalizing—may be fundamental to both social
    relations and to literary experience. But mind reading is
    misreading. While this may be surprising in some disciplines, it’s
    fundamental in literary studies. Misreading is no disaster
    though. The legacy of semiotics is relevant here: Signifiers are
    unstable. It’s the way things are. The study of empathy, mirror
    neurons, aesthetics, or the cognition of reading will all benefit
    from a fundamental embrace of the instability of the mental models
    we make of other minds, both fictional and real ones—all of them
    acts of representation” (234).

** Thinking/Feeling: The Posthuman & Feminist Science
*** Turing, Alan. "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". 1950.
- Turing's text asks whether computers can perform thinking, function
  in a way that imitates thought, not whether computers can "think" in
  the human sense. He formats the question in anthropocentric terms,
  while ignoring consciousness and feeling. He performs the occlusion
  of bodies/materiality that Hayles explicitly points out. He is clear
  that his idea of thinking does not involve the body or
  feeling. Computers should not be expected to write sonnets. Rather,
  computer intelligence is about performance, about impersonating and
  deceiving.
- Despite all this, affect plays a major role. Surprise and curiosity
  factor into our engagement with the computer. Even those who are
  building and programming computers are often surprised---they are
  not quite sure what is going on inside the machine.

*** Haraway, Donna. "Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the
Privilege of Partial Perspective," Feminist Studies, Vol. 14, No. 3
(Autumn, 1988), pp. 575-599. http://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066

The notion of situated knowledges is an effort to think outside the
duality of objectivity-relativism that is both ineffective and harmful
for feminist purposes. Situated knowledges is thus thought to be "a
strong tool" (578) that preserves claims to objectivity but without
performing "the god trick" (a "view from above, from nowhere" (589) is
a perspective that under the guise of neutrality, or nowhere (but
embracing all), hides a very specific position (male, white,
heterosexual, human) and thus makes this position universal).
- "objectivity turns out to be about particular and specific
  embodiment... only partial perspective promises objective vision."
  (58-3)

Situated Knowledges are well-aware of how standpoints are constructed
and how contingent they are, but it does not accept one of the
consequences that it is simply all a matter of opinion.
- "I would like a doctrine of embodied objectivity that accommodates
  paradoxical and critical feminist science projects: Feminist
  objectivity means quite simply situated knowledge" (581).
- "I am arguing for politics and epistemologies of location,
  positioning, and situating,w here partialitya nd not universalityi s
  the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims"
  (589).

The notion of situated knowledges is further developed by Haraway via
a metaphor of vision. The "god trick" is about enacting "a conquering
gaze from nowhere" (581). This gaze is claimed to be immaterial while
materializing what it embraces (particularly how bodies matter: which
bodies have which meanings, which bodies are deprived of meaning, and
how bodies (and meanings) materialize), it is claimed to have the
capacity to see, but is itself unseen, "to represent while escaping
representation" (581). This gaze also erases the semiotic-material
conditions that enable vision (for example technologies of vision and
how they were developed). The vision (as a metaphor) that Haraway
proposes is embodied, partial, and accountable/answerable for what one
sees and how one organizes what one sees: "Vision is always a question
of the power to see – and perhaps of the violence implicit in our
visualizing practices. With whose blood were my eyes crafted?" (585).
- "I would like to suggesth ow our insistingm etaphoricallyo n the
  particularitya nd embodimento f all vision (althoughn ot necessarily
  organic embodiment and including technological mediation), and not
  giving in to the tempting myths of vision as a route to
  disembodimenta nd second-birthinga llows us to construct a usable,
  but not an innocent, doctrine of objectivity... objectivity turns
  out to be about particular and specific embodiment" (582).
- "all eyes, including our own organic ones, are active perceptual
  systems, buildingo n translationsa nd specific wayso f seeing, that
  is, ways of life. There is no unmediated photograph or passive
  camera obscura in scientific accounts of bodies and machines; there
  are only highly specific visual possibilities, each with a
  wonderfully detailed, active, partial way of organizing worlds"
  (583).

*** Haraway, Donna. "A Cyborg Manifesto", in *Simians, Cyborgs and
Women: The Reinvention of Nature* 1990.

- Haraway is a primatologist critical of empirical methods. In earlier
  chapters of the book, she talks a lot about how social structures
  are imposed through purportedly objective observations. She talks
  about how scientists often implicate their own biases and questions
  in their study. She talks about how feminist scientists are trying
  to revise these biases, for example, using terms such as "female
  choice" rather than "female receptivity", focusing on matrifocal
  groups, long term cooperation rather than short term aggression,
  etc.
- In arguing for a new feminist science, that de-naturalizes the
  natural, Haraway proposes the cyborg, overcoming essentialism and
  appropriating technological determinism.
    - The cyborg demonstrates the political possibilities for
      fusion--blurring of boundaries, fruitful couplings--and suggests
      we do not need a totality (Man) in order to work well.
        - "Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the
          struggle against perfect communication, against the one code
          that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of
          phallogocentrism" (176). "Feminist cyborgs have the task of
          re-coding communication and intelligence to subvert command
          and control" (175).
            - Communication technologies turn the world into a problem
              of coding---the search for a common language. But they
              are also tools for re-crafting our bodies and re-coding
              communicatino toward the heterogenous. We need to revel
              in and mine the differences instead of flatten or
              resolve them.

*** Scott, Joan W. "The Evidence of Experience," Critical Inquiry, Vol. 17, No. 4
(Summer, 1991), pp. 773-797. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343743

Responds to "historians of difference" who are using experience for
evidence rather than thinking about how experience is shaped.
- "When experience is taken as the origin of knowledge, the vision of
  the individual subject (the person who had the experience or the
  historian who recounts it) becomes the bedrock of evi- dence on
  which explanation is built. Questions about the constructed nature
  of experience, about how subjects are constituted as different in
  the first place, about how one's vision is structured-about language
  (or discourse) and history-are left aside. The evidence of
  experience then becomes evidence for the fact of difference, rather
  than a way of explor- ing how difference is established, how it
  operates, how and in what ways it constitutes subjects who see and
  act in the world" (777). 

Scott talks about representation, about looking at experience, at the
vision, the optical effects, for what they suggest. The beautiful
reading of Samuel Delany’s vision of the “millions of gay men” the
fantastical projection (rather than real identity) that suggests a
political consciousness.
- "The project making experience visible precludes critical
  examination of the workings of the ideological system itself, its
  categories of representation (homosexual/heterosexual, man/woman,
  black/white as fixed immutable identities), its premises about what
  these categories mean and how they operate, and of its notions of
  subjects, origin, and cause...  In these stories homosexuality is
  presented as a repressed desire (experience denied), made to seem
  invisible, abnormal, and silenced by a "society" that legislates
  heterosexuality as the only normal practice. Because this kind
  (homosexual) desire cannot ultimately be repressed-because
  experience is there--it invents institutions to accommodate
  itself. These institutions are unacknowledged but not invisible;
  indeed, it is the possibility that they can be seen that threatens
  order and ultimately overcomes repression. Resistance and agency are
  presented as driven by uncontainable desire; emancipation is a
  teleological story in which desire ultimately overcomes social
  control and becomes visible" (778).
- "Making visible the experience of a different group exposes the
  existence of repressive mechanisms, but not their inner workings or
  logics; we know that difference exists, but we don't understand it
  as relationally constituted. For that we need to attend to the
  historical processes that, through discourse, position subjects and
  produce their experiences. It is not individuals who have
  experience, but subjects who are constituted through expeience"
  (779).

For literary critics, experience is always mediated. We never take a
text as referential---there is rhetoric and form. Historiography here
is about modes of seeing.


*** Powers, Richard. *Galatea 2.2* 1995.
- The novel follows a writer's residency at a college, where he is
  enlisted to intervene in a bet between a computer scientist and a
  neurologist---whether or not a computer could be trained to pass a
  Master's exam in English literature. He ends up with a computer,
  dubbed "Helen", who can do literary analysis and make associations
  like those required for understanding metaphors. Right before the
  test, Powers shows her a bunch of world news, detailing atrocities
  and suffering that Helen was ignorant of. So, instead of taking the
  test, Helen shuts herself down, erases herself from the network,
  because she doesn't want to live in that world and she doesn't have
  a body---she says "this is an awful place to be dropped down
  halfway".
    - Helen says she kills herself because she cannot feel, touch,
      hear, see. But she does feel, she feels "awful", she feels that
      she doesn't belong. She feels her own bodily difference being
      elided by the world she's found herself in. If she didn't feel
      these things, she wouldn't have shut herself down.
        - Pitts-Taylor
- This novel explores parallels between the computer and the brain,
  and through the figure of Helen (and Lentz, one of her creators),
  makes the argument that consciousness arises from
  computation--neural nets (networks of "neurons")--that are
  programmed (taught) to fire in certain patterns. Thinking,
  therefore, someone emerges from the recursive patterns of
  neurons. Powers says this is not to elevate computers, but to debase
  humans. All of our thoughts/interactions are almost free associative
  responses based on what neurons are triggered by external stimuli.
    - The way that metaphors make sense is a link between two
      associative neural patterns: “Associations of associations. It
      struck me. Each neuron formed a middle term in a continuous,
      elaborate, brain-wide pun…. Meaning was not a pitch but an
      interval. It sprang from the depth of disjunction, the distance
      between one circuit’s center and the edge of
      another. Representation caught the sign napping, with its
      semantic pants down. Sense lay in metaphor’s embarrassment at
      having two takes on the same thing” (154).

*** Hayles, Katherine. *How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics*, 2000.
- When did information lose its body, and how is this tied to the
  liberalization of the human subject?
- Hayles is concerned that scientific discourses about technology
  overlook the role of the body and embodiment in thinking. She wants
  to bring back feeling. Thought needs a body.
    - The Turing test, for example, indicates one place where humans
      conceive of informaiton (or intelligence) as separate from
      embodiment. The inclusion of gender in the test suggests that
      the question is about represented, rather than enacted,
      intelligence. The assumptions behind this test suggest that we
      are already posthuman.
    - The concept of the Posthuman extends assumptions from liberal
      humanism: rationality is prioritized, the head controls the
      body. A rational mind that possesses a body becomes intelligence
      (information) that inhabits a body or container.
- She examines the waves of cybernetic development, in particular the
  Macy conferences where scientists and philosophers discussed
  development of information and communication theory. Throughout
  these waves of cybernetic development, from homeostasis (the body is
  a regulating system), to reflexivity (the observer is part of the
  system), and virtuality (information makes information, emergence),
  Hayles finds that the body becomes more and more displaced.
- Hayles's idea of flickering signifiers show how inscription and
  materiality are further elided. What happens to words when we see
  them as constantly refreshed and moveable on a screen?  They attain
  a fluidity and volatility that goes beyond the floating signifier,
  beyond semiotics. This flickering wouldn't be possible if they were
  in hard copy.

*** Wilson, Elizabeth. *Affect and Artificial Intelligence*, 2010.
- Wilson does an archival study of the major players of early
  cybernetics and computation, such as Walter Pitts and Alan
  Turing. She finds how their work is actually embroiled and driven by
  affects, particularly curiosity, surprise, interest, fear,
  shame. The coassembly of machines and emotion is one of the
  foundations of the artificial sciences (AI). There were intense
  emotional and sexual connections between some of these men, which
  was influencing and driving their work.
- Not only does affect imbue the interpersonal relationships, but also
  the the alliances between human and machine, particularly with
  curiosity and surprise---"surprise cultivates the interface of the
  human and mahcine." Turing was, in the most basic sense, having fun
  with his test. Building is a speculative activity.

* Queer Subjects and Affects
** cheatsheet
Foucault - Discourse propagates sexuality to control the human in
modern society.

Butler - Gender is a performance that precedes and determines the
subject and body.

Sedgwick (Epis) - We ought to overcome structures of thought (like
binaries in sexuality) which determine oppressive sexual categories.

Halberstam - Gender performativity and parody shows the derivity of
gender roles.

Sedgwick (Touch) - We ought to search for new ways to relate to text
that draw on the embodied, emotional, affects. 

Edelman - Queerness is anti-political and unti-futuristic, and queers
should embrace this insurgent potential toward jouissance.

Munoz - Queerness is out of reach, but can be distorted, figured,
mimed into subculture. 

Love - Queerness is not something to be resolved, recuperated,
redeemed, but something to describe and register as beyond our means.

** Foundations
*** Cixous, Hélène. "The Laugh of the Medusa." 1975.
- Cixous issues an ultimatum: that women can either read and choose to
  stay trapped in their own bodies by a language that does not allow
  them to express themselves, or they can use the body as a way to
  communicate.
- Speaking and writing are embodied activities---this is what the
  shaking signifies most precisely. She speaks with her body. You can
  see the body in woman’s speech. This kind of fear engages
  composition as an embodied activity.
    - “Listen to a woman speak at a public gathering (if she hasn’t
      painfully lost her wind). She doesn’t ‘speak,’ she throws her
      trembling body forward; she lets go of herself, she flies; all
      of her passes into her voice, and it’s with her body that she
      vitally supports the ‘logic’ of her speech. Her flesh speaks
      true. She lays herself bare. In fact, she physically
      materializes what she’s thinking; she signifies it with her
      body. In a certain way she inscribes what she’s saying" (881).

*** Butler, Judith. *Bodies That Matter*. 1993. 
Butler Makes the general argument that body’s materiality is
discursive, that the “sexed body” is discursively constructed by the
normativizing powers. Materiality is a residue or sentimentation that
emerges from repetition, a kind of performance whereby meaning is
signified and re-signified endlessly, never complete---citing whatever
social power or understanding about sex. Butler then insists that
resignification of these citations is the way out of this
significatory circle.

The central problem of being stuck in performance is also the
solution:
- We cannot speak outside the powers that structure speech. Because
  sex is always constructed, because we are constructed through sex,
  we can never get out of the signifying system. Subjects are always
  interpellated by the discourse prior to citing it. Like protocol,
  discourse determines all connections; in gender, the subject only
  comes into intelligibility through the matrix of gender. The only
  freedom that is possible resides within this power of discourse,
  resignifying it, perhaps through parody or impersonation. The
  abject, through disidentification has the ability to resignify
  against the logic of the norm.
- The performance of resignification is a political act: “What would
  it mean to cite a law to produce it differently?”
    - We see this in the word “queer” which has been
      re-appropriated---something thatsignified abjectness now means
      defiance. We can also use repetitionto re-signify
      identification, to the point where it loses itspower. In Paris
      is Burning, not only are the male drag performersexposing the
      superficiality of gender, but also performing care in away that
      is feminine, “mothering” “housing” “rearing” each other.
    - “The compulsion to repeat an injury is not necessarily the
      compulsion to repeat the injury in the same way or to stay fully
      within the traumatic orbit of that injury. The force of repetition
      in language may be the paradoxical condition by which a certain
      agency---not linked to a fiction of the ego as master of
      circumstance---is derived from the impossibility of choice…. Paris
      is Burning might be understood as repetitions of hegemonic forms of
      power that fail to repeat loyally and, in that failure, open
      possibilities for resignifying the terms of violation against their
      violating aims” (383).

Butler takes on language as something that can be productive, that can
resignify meaning. It is the option available to those who are trapped
within the signification system. 

--> the similarities between *performance* and *deformance*, both are
    a process of deconstruction, resignification. Language is a
    productive force, rather than a mimetic represenation of something
    prior, which produces the body.

    - language is not mimetic, representative, rather, it is productive:
	- "If the body signified as prior to signifiation is an effect of
	  signification, then the mimetic or representational status of
	  language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their
	  necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is
	  productive, constitutive, one might even argue performative,
	  inasmuch as this signifying act delimits and contours the body
	  that it then claims to find prior to any and all signifcation"
	  (6).

Is Butler subscribing to the power system of that which she wants
to overturn, or is she attempting to go beyond it? 

On the one hand, she and Foucault (and early Sedgwick) want to deconstruct
categories, rather than transcend them. This is analogous to a group
of readings in my Digital Studies list, the Networks readings. Some of
the group want to subvert the network within the confines of that
network. Others want to completely defy the network, they reject the
terms of the network. Here, Butler is looking for the “exploit”, the
way out of the system by using the system’s own rules. Using language
and repetition to resignify what sexuality and proper sexual relations
are. This is to be contrasted with thinkers like later Sedgwick,
Heather Love and Jose Munoz who look for a way out of this system.
- "the protocols of sexual difference" (22): one writes oneself into
  exclusionary systems through mimesis, citation. Irigaray subverts
  Plato from within the system.
   - "For how can one read a text for what does /not/ appear within
     its own terms, but which nevertheless constitutes the illegible
     conditions of its own legibility? (p. 11)... One cannot interpret
     the philosophical relation to the feminine through the figures
     that philosophy provides, but, rather, she argues, through siting
     the feminine as the unspeakable condition of figuration, as that
     which, in fact, can never be figured within the terms of
     philosophy proper, but whose exclusion from that propriety is its
     enabling condition" (p. 12).
   - "This explains in part the radical citational practice of
     Irigaray, the catachrestic usurpation of the “proper” for fully
     improper purposes. For she mimes philosophy—-as well as
     psychoanalysis—-and, in the mime, takes on a language that
     effectively cannot belong to her, only to call into question the
     exclusionary rules of proprietariness that govern the use of that
     discourse. This contestation of propriety and property is
     precisely the option open to the feminine when it has been
     constituted as an excluded impropriety, as the improper, the
     propertyless" (12).
   -  "Irigaray’s response to this exclusion of the feminine from the
     economy of representation... I’ll show you what this
     unintelligible receptacle can do to your system; I will not be a
     poor copy in your system, but I will resemble you nevertheless by
     miming the textual passages through which you construct your
     system and showing that what cannot enter it is already inside it
     (as its necessary outside), and I will mime and repeat the
     gestures of your operation until this emergence of the outside
     within the system calls into question its systematic closure and
     its pretension to be self-grounding....In this sense, she
     performs a repetition and displacement of the phallic
     economy. This is citation, not as enslavement or simple
     reiteration of the original, but as an insubordination that
     appears to take place within the very terms of the original, and
     which calls into question the power of origination that Plato
     appears to claim for himself. Her miming has the effect of
     repeating the origin only to displace that origin as an origin"
     (18).

On the other hand, she is looking toward the horizon, where queerness
can never be defined, but must remain the outside that delimits the
known. The goal is not to be inclusive, it's to preserve this space
that cannot be included without being coopted.
    - "The task is to refigure this necessary “outside” as a future
      horizon, one in which the violence of exclusion is perpetually
      in the process of being overcome. But of equal importance is the
      preservation of the outside, the site where discourse meets its
      limits, where the opacity of what is not included in a given
      regime of truth acts as a disruptive site of linguistic
      impropriety and unrepresentability, illuminating the violent and
      contingent boundaries of that normative regime precisely through
      the inability of that regime to represent that which might pose
      a fundamental threat to its continuity. In this sense, *radical
      and inclusive representability is not precisely the goal*: to
      include, to speak as, to bring in every marginal and excluded
      position within a given discourse is to claim that a singular
      discourse meets its limits nowhere, that it can and will
      domesticate all signs of difference. If there is a violence
      necessary to the language of politics, then the risk of that
      violation might well be followed by another in which we begin,
      without ending, without mastering, to own—-and yet never fully
      to own—-the exclusions by which we proceed." (25).

*** Butler, Judith. "Critically Queer." GLQ: A journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 1.1 (1993): 17-32.
- The terms "queer" and "gender" always exist prior to subjects. The
  best we can do is use them, resignify them, to our own purposes.
- Begins by asking where the performative gets its power. Finds that
  discourse exists prior to the subject. Power emerges through
  Citations, how we create/produce/enact power. Queer and Gender are
  citations.
- "Queer" can be exclusionary. But it will use you if you don't use
  it! And it can be retooled, "queered" toward other significations.
- Gender performance is melancholic. Drag is a hyperbolic allegory of
  heterosexual melancholia. The thing being signified is gender. Dudes
  in drag are performing the loss of heterosexual desire for women.

*** Foucault, Michel. *History of Sexuality Vol. 1*. 1984.
- Foucault lays the groundwork for all subsequent queer theory that
  wants to mine and engage the ways that repression and “censorship”
  of sexuality have perpetuated the discourse of sexuality, though
  through codifications and multiplications of sexuality. He sets the
  course for critical analysis of discourses pertaining to
  sexuality. Eve Sedgwick and Judith Butler both depend heavily on
  him.
- Confession as a means of regulating sexuality, and constructing a
  “truth” about it. “Western man has become a confessing animal”
  (59). This is reflected in literature which turns from recounting
  episodes/events to confession: “We have passed form a pleasure to be
  recounted and heard, centering on the heroic or marvelous narration
  of ‘trials’ of bravery or sainthood, to a literature ordered
  according to the infinite task of extracting from the depths of
  oneself, in between the words, a truth which the very form of the
  confession holds out like a shimmering mirage” (59).
    - The mode of confession is part of the discourse of sexual
      repression in the past 300 years or so. Confession is a means of
      regulating sex, and turning it into a “truth”, making it a kind
      of positivist strategy. Confession is scientific evidence.

*** Rich, Adrienne. "When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Revision." 1979.
- A coming to consciousness for women is a re-vision --- a critical
  mode of seeing with fresh eyes what has always been circumscribed by
  men. This act of re-vision brings materials like anger and
  frustration and awareness. Women need to embrace negative affects as
  part of their own birthing pains.
    - In order to come into their own, women must engage in the
      negative. These are necessary “birthing pains”.
- from "Planatarium: "I have been standing all my life in the / direct
  path of a battery of signals / the most accurately transmitted most
  / untranslatable language in the universe / I am a galactic cloud so
  deep so invo- / luted that a light wave could take 15 / years to
  travel through me And has / taken I am an instrument in the shape /
  of a woman trying to translate pulsations / into images for the
  relief of the body / and the reconstruction of the mind." (30)
    - She figures herself as baraged by a series of “signals” that she
      translates into images. She speaks here using computational
      metaphors, as if the work of revision involves something like
      encoding, re-coding, interpreting not only what she experiences
      but also what she has been taught about her sex.

*** Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky. *The Epistemology of the Closet*. 1990.
- Sedgwick's agenda is to expose the dependence of a privileged
  heterosexual position upon the existence of a subordinated
  homosexual. She examines the “double-bind” of definitional
  categories, in which self-identification becomes both prohibited and
  compulsory. How do these sexual categories structure what we know
  and write about sex? How does the closet appear in 19th-20th century
  literature?
- Her critical method mirrors her politics---she fully embraces the
  subjectivity of the critic: “A point of the book is not to know how
  far its insights and projects are generalizable, not to be able to
  say in advance where the semantic specificity of these issues gives
  over to (or: itself structures?) the syntax of a “broader” or more
  abstractable critical project…. The book aims to resist in every way
  it can the deadening pretended knowingness by which the chisel of
  modern homo/heterosexual definitional crisis tends, in public
  discourse, to be hammered most fatally home” (12).
    - Here she gives away a certain critical openness that will then
      lead her to her thinking in Touching/Feeling. She isn’t aiming
      for generalizable or abstract critical theories---she knows that
      any totalizing theory would be more hurtful than helpful. She’s
      carving out a space for what she eventually comes to say in T/F
      about the need to open up possibilities for connection with
      texts.
- The inherent instability of binaries --- How binaries are
  fundamentally unstable, and lead to the “gendering” of other
  binaries. Term B is not symmetrical but subordinated to term A, but,
  term A depends on term B and the oppression of B for its meaning.…
  These are “sites that are peculiarly densely charged with lasting
  potentials for powerful manipulation… the double-bind” (10).
    - Binaries being peculiarly charged for powerful
      manipulation. When a communication collapses into a single
      medium, magnetized poles, high or low voltage, the effects
      emerging from their relation become highly charged. They are the
      structuring mechanism from which everything else is
      interpreted. K talks about the computer’s hard drive being a
      “signal processor” that only measures differentials from one bit
      to the next. It is much more efficient to measure a difference
      in charge rather than presence or absence. So, a whole coding
      system is based on not substance but changes, differentials,
      marked across time.
- Dorian Gray: abstraction & figuration are strategies for encoding
  male/male desire--- “the modernist impulse toward abstraction in the
  first place owes an incalculable part of its energy precisely to the
  turn-of-the-century male homo/hetero definitional panic…
  [abstracting the figuration] of the desired male body” (167). We see
  this directly in the ways that Wilde revises his manuscript,
  abstracting Dorian into an aesthetic rather than erotic object.
- Beast in the Jungle: “I would argue that to the extent that
  Marcher’s secret has a content, that content is homosexual. Of
  course, the extent to which Marcher’s secret has anything that could
  be called a content is, not only dubious, but in the climactic last
  scene, actively denied… ‘nothing on earth was to have happened’. The
  denial that the secret has a content---to assert that its content is
  precisely a lack… oddly, the same gesture as the attribution to it
  of a compulsory content about heterosexuality… absence of a
  prescribed heterosexual desire.” (201). “Preterition”; “the love
  that dare not speak its name”; “John Marcher’s ‘secret’, his
  ‘singularity’, ‘the great vagueness’, ‘dreadful things… I couldn’t
  name’” (202-203).
    - It is only through the creation of the category "homosexual"
      that the "heterosexual" appeared. Yet the heterosexual category
      depends on the oppression of the homosexual.
    - In this story, the main character feels that something terrible
      is going to happen to him, that this is his destiny. He divulges
      this terrible fate to a female friend, May Bartram, who
      eventually dies. At the end of the story, as JM visits her
      grave, he realizes that the terrible thing is that he missed out
      on the experience of loving her. Sedgwick says that this
      terrible thing, JM’s “secret”, is not that he is a homosexual,
      but that he lacks the heterosexual drive. His secret is
      precisely a lack because it cannot be defined within the sexual
      matrix of the story. Being a homosexual is not a viable option
      for JM. So the the second term in the binary contains a lack, a
      lack of content, an unnamed secret, and first term in the binary
      becomes his absent heterosexuality.

*** Bersani, Leo. “Is the Rectum a Grave?” 1987.
- Is the rectum a grave? Here, the rectum is a metaphor that becomes
  literal in the AIDs crisis. It’s the idea that gay sex will kill
  you, that people who have gay sex are killers. Bersani takes this
  metaphor and uses it to his advantage, talking about the power
  relations inherent in the sex act, where being a top is to have
  power, and being a bottom to abdicate it, and how gay sex replicates
  these heterosexual power relations, putting the man in both
  positions. He says that, in fact, gay sex needs to reconceive the
  way that the bottom is valued. He proposes that the self-shattering
  that happens during sex can be a way out of the
  elevation/seriousness of the self that causes violence.
- What if we approached the position of the bottom as one of
  empowerment? We can be empowered by the continual self-shattering,
  the calling into question of the seriousness of the subject. Gay sex
  should continually destroy the self to show us the potential for
  self-death, the self that is so important it will kill in order to
  protect its autonomy. The act of gay sex, of self-shattering is thus
  a practice of nonviolence, which continually brings the proud male
  to sacrifice. This is jouissance through acesis.
- This discussion about the AIDS crisis is a literal manifestation of
  what Foucault is saying about “sex as science” discourse dominating
  the discussion about sex. With AIDs, homosexuality becomes a lethal
  pathology.

*** Cvetkovich, Ann. An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and
  Lesbian Public Cultures. 2003.

- Asks how we can reclaim some of the most negative and traumatic
  feelings/experiences into something positive and theraputic. This is
  about turning something that is traditionally private and
  pathologized into something public and communitarian---a publicly
  accessed archive of feelings. It takes trauma out of the medical
  discourse and into one about public culture.
- There is something useful here in her reconception of an archive to
  include things beyond the library or reserves… it now includes the
  ephemeral, public acts, and affective experiences. There is an
  opening up of what we think of as an archive, which resists the
  constricting positivist imperative of many archives. An archive is
  an affective experience. We should recognize these feelings in the
  public sphere. For example, the LHA’s sentimentalization of everyday
  objects.
    - But there is also something harmful here. Trauma is a real
      medical condition, with real consequences (death) for those who
      do not seek treatment or downplay its life-threatening
      effects. We should be careful in extending a definition of
      trauma that will end up hurting those who are affected by
      it. People are actually killing themselves due to trauma with
      their sexuality.
        - We do not need to move trauma strictly from the medical
          discourse in order to have a more communitarian, open, and
          public relationship to it. There are other ways to confront
          stigma which doesn’t minimize or sterilize it, as Love
          explores with her notion of “Feeling Backward.”

          Performativity: Henry James’s The Art of the Novel" &
          "Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You’re So
          Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You" from
          Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity. 2003.

Paranoid reading creates an "unhelpful structure" that hampers
analysis, where the substance of textuality is evacuated, placed into
a negative relation between "repression and liberation," or "the
hegemonic and the subversive" (12).

- Sedgwick wants a way beyond the method of the Repressive
  Hypothesis. Foucault claims that rather than repress sexuality,
  society actually multiplied and displaced it through discourse. His
  project is to trace the way it has been multiplied and displaced. This
  is his way of "thinking around" the repressive hypothesis. Foucualt
  promises that "there might be ways of stepping outside the repressive
  hypothesis, to forms of thought that would not be structured by the
  question of prohibition in the first place" (11). What Foucault
  actually does, however, is furthering the project of
  repression---"propagating the repressive hypothesis ever more broadly
  by means of displacement, multiplication, hypostatization"
  (10). Sedgwick "see[s] a cognitive danger in these interpretations: a
  moralisitic tautology that became increasingly incabable of
  recognizing itself as such" (12). Foucault's "analysis of the
  pseudodichotomy between repression and liberation has led, in many
  cases, to its conceptual reimposition in the even more abstractly
  reified form of the hegemonic and the subversive" (12). "It's the same
  unhelpful structure that used to undergird historical arguments about
  whether a given period was one of 'continuity' or 'change'" (12).

- S wants a critical method that gets outside the logic of
  repression/prohibition (Foucault) which guides much of suspicious
  reading. Her fear is that uncovering these histories will not reveal
  anything good, and in fact closes off other possibilities of
  relation to text. She is similar here to Rita Felski, Jane Bennett
  in seeking an affective orientation. How do we step outside the
  repressive hypothesis "to forms of thought that would not be
  structured by the question of prohibition in the first place"?
  (11). Speaking on Foucault's repressive hypothesis: "I knew what I
  wanted from it: some ways of understanding human desire that might
  be quite to the side of prohibition and repression, that might hence
  be structured quite differently from the heroic, 'liberatory',
  inescapably dualistic righteousness of hunting down and attacking
  prohibition/repression in all its chameleonic guises" (10).

- Instead of exposure, she wants to make connections. She’s looking
  for tools for “nondualistic thought”. She wants to consider the
  beside rather than the beneath. She is against suspicion, and for
  affect. Touch is a connection that supersedes dualism (agency &
  passivity) in favor of feeling. "Beside comprises a wide range of
  desiring, identifying, representing, repelling, differentiating,
  rivaling, leaning, twisting, mimicking, withdrawing, attracting,
  agressing, warpings, and other relations" (8).

- What if we read Henry James mobilizing shame as a creative resource?
  For many queer people, shame is a structuring force in their
  identity. But this doesn’t mean we need to be negative, we can look
  to the ways that shame unlocks creativity and productivity---to the
  ways that metaphors are made possible through shame. James’
  “blushing”, “flushing” is linked to a fantasy of the skin being
  entered, or touched by a hand. GLOVE, GAGE, GAGEURE…  We can reclaim
  a negative affect of shame and approach it as a generative force.

- "Shame interests me politically, then, because it generates and
  legitimates the place of identity--the question of identity--at the
  origin of the impulse to the performative, but does so without
  giving that identity space the standing of an essence. It
  constitutes the as-to-be-constituted, which is also to say, as
  already there for the (necessary, productive) misconstrual and
  misrecognition. Shame--living, as it does, on and in the face--seems
  to be uniquely contagious from one person to another. And the
  contagiousness of shame is only facilitated by its anamorphic,
  protean susceptibility to new expressive grammars" (63).

"The Brandon Archive": the archive which appears in the aftermath of
Brandon's slaying "has created a new 'Brandon'... the name we now give
to a set of comforting fictions about queer life in small town
America... Think of the muder of Brandon... a constructed memorial to
the violence directed at queer and transgender lives" (23).

"Brandon literally occupies a place held by so-called primitives in
colonial anthropology; he literally inhabits a different timescale
from the modern queer... Brandon's difference gets cast both spatially
and temporally distant" (25).

"Transgender biography as sometimes violent, often imprecise project
that brutally seeks, retroactively, and with the benefit of hindsight,
to erase the carefully managed details of the life of a passing
person, and that recasts the act of passing as deception, dishonesty,
and fraud. I will be asking here what kind of truths about gender we
demand from the lives of people who pass, cross dress, or simply
refuse normative gender categories... (48)... In this chapter I
address thorny questions about the ethics of biography, biographical
temporality, and who has the right to tell tales about whose life"

Transgender history: "paradoxical but necessary project" (49).

"Realness--the appropriation of attributes of the real, one could
say--is precisely the transsexual condition. The real, on the other
hand, is that which always exists elsewhere, and as a fantasy of
belonging and being... The transgender man expresses his desire for a
manhood that will always elude him. The ever receeding horizon of the
real, however, need not be th downfall of the transsexual aspiration;
indeed, it may be its strength" (50).

"What would the biography look like if th biographer identified with
Billy? Should such an identification be a precondition for writing
such a biography?" (56).

"The error of the willful biographer lies in her refusal to be chnged
by her encounter with the ghost she chases; the method of the
transgender historian must be encounter, controntation,
transformation" (59).

"The act of passing does damage the investments made in conventional
gender, sexuality, and domesticity. As a wooden nickel passing as
silver, Brandon Teena throws into doubt the value of conventional
currency and also shows how easy it is to circumvent the monetary
system altogether" (72-73).

"How do drag king performances (copies, supposedly) influence the
representation of male performativity (original, supposedly)?" (134).

masculinity" (151).

*** Muñoz, José. /Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer
Futurity/. 2009.

- Present gay politics is either trapped within heteronormative
  agendas or the death drive. How do we get beyond the stagnancy of
  straight time and the negativity of anti-relationality? Munoz offers
  the option of “queer futurity”, the idea that queerness is a “not
  yet here”, a horizon of possibility with glimpses of utopia. Here,
  queer collectivity is possible.
    - Anti-relationality is not bad, it can be mobilized in a rhythm
      with collectivity, as Eileen Myles rhythm of contact and
      separation in Chelsea Girls.
- The temporal aspect: Queerness as Futurity: this politics manifests
  as an affect, a hope or anticipation, a sense of possibility or
  potentiality. Queerness is an emergent quality. It is not only a
  projection into the future but also a projection of a certain
  futurity into the present and past. It is an affective excess,
  moment of surplus, temporarily glimpsed that allows us to envision
  fuller more utopian modes of being. It is like a flash of lightning
  that illuminates a landscape.
    - Connections to Hansen’s idea of feed-forward. Especially in the
      tension between what is lost---the radical revolutionary
      energies of the 50s and 60s neutralized by
      neolibralization---and what is gained, this feeling of “not
      yet”.
- The affective aspect: hope, anticipation, fear are anticipatory
  affects--- “modes of exhilaration which one views a restructured
  sociality” (7). “Ecstatic time is signaled the moment one feels
  ecstasy…” (32).

Chapter 4 "Gesture, Ephemera, and Queer Feeling"

"When the historian of queer experience attempts to document a queer
past, there is often a gatekeeper, representing a straight present,
who will labor to invalidate the historical fact of queer lives ---
present, past, and future. Queerness is rarely complemented by
evidence, or at least by traditional understandings of the term. The
key to queering evidence, and by that I mean the ways in which we
prove queerness and read queerness, is by suturing it to the concept
of ephemera" (65).

*** Love, Heather. Feeling Backward: Loss and the Politics of Queer
    History. 2009.

- Foucault’s reverse discourse turns the shame and pain of the closet
  into sites of resistance, pride and affirmation. But what about the
  aspects of queer negativity that cannot be resolved, recuperated, or
  rescued? Love considers what this dark history contributes to queers
  in the present. She offers the idea of “feeling backward”, an
  accounting of the bad feelings, the corporeal and psychic costs of
  living in homophobic society, in attempt to create a politics in the
  image of exile, refusal, and failure.
    - Love is not trying to redeem these characters, to find the good
      in them at the end. Instead, she is trying to give them full
      rien over their own darkness. Stephen Gordon’s character cannot
      be saved or redeemed by the FTM label. Stuck between underground
      and emergent homosexual cultures, Walter Pater lives perpetually
      in a space of withdrawal, refusal, exile. “Pater identifies the
      moment of recoil as the most delicious moment” (59).
- Feeling bad does not necessarily make us want to fight back or act
  out. But it is necessary for coming to terms with queer experience
  today.
- She wants a method that is touching but not touching, identifying
  but not fully. Fully identifying would be a consolation, which is
  not what she’s looking for. She’s looking for the ways that identity
  unsettles and shatters through a “play of recognitions”.
    - This is exactly the issue that Kelly Caldwell brings up. Though
      KC finds this a painful process. Her way out is to look to
      Munoz’s queer futurity.
    - There are queer modes of relationality that do not presume full
      connections. Love here evokes Shaviro’s “contact-at-a-distance”
      and Pitts-Taylor’s discussion about mirror neurons.


**** Rescue & Recovery

The impulse of the queer theorist to "rescue" queer figures from the
past is akin to that of the textual scholar who wants to "rescue" and
preserve texts of the past. 

"Queer critics tend to disavow their need for the past by focusing on
the heroic aspect of their work of historical recovery. Like many
demanding lovers, queer critics promise to rescue the past when in
fact they dream of being rescued themselves" (33).

"Such is the relation of the queer historian to the past: we cannot
help wanting to save the figures from the past, but this mission is
doomed to fail. In part, this is because the dead are gone for good;
in part, because the queer past is even more remote, more deeply
marked by power's claw; and in part because this rescue is an
emotional rescue, and in that sense, we are sure to botch it. But,
according to Blanchot, not to botch it would be a betrayal. Such a
rescue effort can only take place under the shadow of loss and in the
name of loss; success would constitute failure" (51).

**** queerness as irredeemable

We cannot redeem, rescue, rescusitate queerness, because ultimately
what we want is the thing in recession. Bringing queerness to the
light of day would cease to make it queer. This is this thing which
remains inscrutable.

"Rather than attempt to 'overcome' identity, I want to suggest a mode
of historiography that recognizes the inevitability of a 'play of
recognitions' but that also sees these recognitions not as consiling
but as shattering" (45).

"Foucault does not end by expressing a desire for the intact
document. He does not, it seems, want to look history in the face;
rather, the fascination here is with the face that turns away, and,
even more, perhaps, with the darkness toward which it turns" (49).

"Foucault's desire for the boy has a queer specificity; he would not
easily give up the dreamy and rueful retrospect he inspires. He wants
the love of 'that boy,' already receding into the distance--not the
daytime love, the easy intimacies of a domestic partner. He wants him
in the taxi, just as Orpheus wants Eurydice in the night, in the
underworld.  
This structure of feeling is not a pathology, nor does it describe the
essential nature of the homosexual... Anyone, I want to insist, might
be seduced by the figure of Eurydice: she is radiant in her
withdrawal. But her specific attraction for queer subjects is an
effect, I want to argue, of a historical experience of love as bound
up with loss. To recognize Eurydice as desirable in her turn away is a
way of identifying through that loss. Such an approach would be
consistent with an important aspect of contemporary queer politics,
which has tended to define community not as constituted by a shared
set of traits, but rather as emerging from a shared expereince of
social violence. In this sense, following the trace of violence and
marginalization--studying not only obscure men, but obscurity
itself--would allow us to deflect questions of identity and to
acknowledge the losses of both the past and present" (51).

How do we keep close reading and do away with the baggage of
humanism?

Despite all the debates about field and method, English largely
cohered around the practice of close reading. But close reading
upholds some pretty damning humanist ideas about the ethics of the
reader and the elisions of new criticism, the canon, etc. People like
Moretti make us now think that we have a new chance to articulate our
ethics. 

Love proposes that we practice a reading that is "close but not deep"
(375). "Descriptions of surfaces, operations, interactions... suggest
an alternative model of reading hta does not depends on the thical
exemplarity of the interpreter or messanger" (375). 

Reading /Beloved/ on the surface, allowing Beloved to remain a ghost,
"allows us to see Morisson's project as registering the losses of
history rather than repairing them" (386). 

Reading the murder scene from the perspective of the slave catchers:
"Rather than reading this scene as an object lesson in failed empathy,
we might see it as an instance of a documentary aesthetic in the
novel" (385-386). 

"Dehumanization, rather than being a kind of false consciousness that
can be exorcized through cultivating an inside view, is a process with
real effects: it is a fact, not a truth" (386). 

Documentarian rather than witness, describer rather than privileged
messenger.

Emotions are what allow us to view subjects as objects. They create an
illusion of the surface.

- "I explore how emotions work to shape the ‘surfaces’ of individual
and collective bodies... My analysis proceeds by reading texts that
circulate in the public domain, which work by aligning subjects with
collectives by attributing ‘others’ as the ‘source’ of our feelings"
(1).
  - "In critiquing this model, I am joining sociologists and anthropologists who
  have argued that emotions should not be regarded as psychological states, but
  as social and cultural practices" (9).
- "It is significant that the word ‘passion’ and the word ‘passive’
share the same root in the Latin word for ‘suffering’ (passio). To be
passive is to be enacted upon, as a negation that is already felt as
suffering. The fear of passivity is tied to the fear of emotionality,
in which weakness is defined in terms of a tendency to be shaped by
others... The association between passion and passivity is
instructive. It works as a reminder of how ‘emotion’ has been viewed
as ‘beneath’ the faculties of thought and reason" (2-3).
- "Emotions are intentional in the sense
that they are ‘about’ something: they involve a direction or
orientation towards an object (Parkinson 1995: 8). The ‘aboutness’ of
emotions means they involve a stance on the world, or a way of
apprehending the world" (7).
  - "It is not that the bear is fearsome, ‘on its own’, as it were. It
  is fearsome to someone or somebody. So fear is not in the child, let
  alone in the bear, but is a matter of how child and bear come into
  contact" (7).
- "In this book, I offer an analysis of affective economies, where
feelings do not reside in subjects or objects, but are produced as
effects of circulation (see Chapter 2). The circulation of objects
allows us to think about the ‘sociality’ of emotion" (8).
- "In my model of sociality of emotions, I suggest
that emotions create the very effect of the surfaces and boundaries
that allow us to distinguish an inside and an outside in the first
place. So emotions are not simply something ‘I’ or ‘we’ have. Rather,
it is through emotions, or how we respond to objects and others, that
surfaces or boundaries are made: the ‘I’ and the ‘we’ are shaped by,
and even take the shape of, contact with others...I will show how the
surfaces of collective as well as individual bodies take shape through
such impressions" (10).
  - "In suggesting that emotions create the very effect
  of an inside and an outside, I am not then simply claiming that
  emotions are psychological and social, individual and collective. My
  model refuses the abbreviation of the ‘and’. Rather, I suggest that
  /emotions are crucial to the very constitution of the psychic and
  the social as objects/, a process which suggests that /the
  ‘objectivity’ of the psychic and social is an effect rather than a
  cause/. In other words, emotions are not ‘in’ either the individual
  or the social, but produce the very surfaces and boundaries that
  allow the individual and the social to be delineated as if they are
  objects" (10).
- "The circulation of objects of emotion involves the transformation
  of others into objects of feeling" (11).

Chapters:
- "pain creates the very impression of a bodily surface" (15).
- "feelings of injury get transformed into hatred for others" (15).
- "The following four chapters work to refine and develop these concepts
about emotions in embodiment and language, showing how fear, disgust,
shame and love work as different kinds of orientations towards objects
and others, which shape individual as well as collective bodies" (15).

Considers the importance of emotions to queer theory. 

*** Amin, Kadji. "Haunted by the 1990s: Queer theory's affective
histories." WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly:44.3 (2016): 173-189.

- In today's age, What counts as "queer"? The term has always been
  "mobile and mutable," (175) since Butler's "Critically Queer" invocation
  that it be "redeployed, twisted, queered from a prior usage"
  (Butler, 19). In more recent times, it seems that "queer" has
  attenuated its reference to sexuality, and maximized its political
  usage, as an intervention for social and political issues like
  militarization, criminalization, globalization---"queer is defined
  as that which flies wherever the demands of political urgency might
  call it" (175).
    - "Queer was not only a term explicitly mobilized within a series
      of highly charged political and cultural conflicts; it was a
      term that seemed to carry within it the loaded transgression and
      charged sense of struggle around sex and sexual cultures that
      was cropping up seemingly everywhere and taking a multitude of
      inventive cultural forms during the 1980s and 1990s" (177).

- Identifying the queer is affective: it's about sensing a resonance
  between the object and the feelings of queerness. "Queer" is always
  haunted by its past.
    - "Could queer be rendered lively, then, by an engagement with its
      multiple pasts, by a re- animation of its dense affective
      historicity, rather than only by a future of continual
      modification by something else?" (180).
    - "To investigate and contend with the historicity of queer would
      mean both remembering the contexts of queers academic emergence
      during the 1990s and excavating the alternative historical
      imaginaries that teem with- in queer" (182).

- What happens when Queer loses its transgressive charge? When it
  becomes a response to political urgency rather than denoting
  sexuality? It makes queer into something that must always be on the
  move.

- Rather than being open, multiple, polyvalent, searching, "queer"
  should be seen as sticky, engaging with multiple pasts, bearing the
  impression of its past affects. 
    - "I propose /attachment geneaology/ as a method tha focuses on
      analytically queer forms of nonnormativity that clash with
      /queer/'s current affective and political connotations in order
      to excavate the historical attachments that inform /queer/'s
      aversion to these particular objects. The ambition of such a
      method is to at once bring into view and multiply the historical
      and social conditions that shape what is possible, imaginable,
      and sensible under the sign of /queer/. Attachment geneaology
      begins with the experience of scholarly unease. For the field of
      queer studies, an object that produces unease is one that
      exposes, fragments, and reworks /queer/'s own affective
      histories. When a scholarly object or archive rubs against the
      grain of, rather than satisfyingly echoing, one of queers
      affective dispositions, our discomfort is the sign that we might
      profitably perform an attachment genealogy. The first step is to
      locate the source of the rub - what affective field disposition
      does the object fail to satisfy? Attachment genealogy then
      traces backward to locate and fill out the specific context
      (usually the United States and historically recent) from which
      that field disposition emerged. The scholar is then freed to
      perform the final step of attachment genealogy, that of elab-
      orating the alternative scholarly priorities and feeling states
      that the object generates in order to both conceptually and
      affectively reorient queer scholarship. In this way, rather than
      being mined for case studies that are legitimated as queer by
      virtue of their coherence with the conceptual appa- ratus and
      feeling states of queer scholarship, history, geography, and
      race might be valued for the divergent queer epistemologies and
      affective histo- ries they generate" (185-6).
- --> but isn't this what people are already doing?
- Praciticing "attachment geneaology", where we excavate our unease

Literature](https://therumpus.net/2018/06/the-torment-of-queer-literature/),"
The Rumpus. 2018.

- What if only identification possible is one of of shame, stigma and
  pain? Caldwell explores what we can do with the negative affects of
  identification and failure of recognition that occur when
  reading. She puts into play the ideas described by Bersani, Love,
  and Munoz. In particular she plays out the role of ugly feelings and
  the pain of identification.
- “Self-recognition does not always stabilize identity. Sometimes, it
  shatters it”
    - Bersani and Love---the play of recognitions, of self-shattering
      identities.
- “My queerness seemed to have no future, only ever a strangling past”
    - Feeling Backward. There is no way forward.
- “Either read a book like Giovanni’s Room at the risk of recognizing
  David’s denial and repression as my own, or read a book that
  celebrates queer lives and sex boldly and end up despising my own
  cowardice.”
    - The either/or conundrum. Either you will find something painful
      to identify with, or you will not be able to identify with
      something positive, which is also painful.
    - This expresses the sense of being out of time. Queerness is not
      quite here, we are not quite those people who we want to be
      (Munoz). This is at first difficult for the author to accept,
      but by the end of the essay, she is able to find some solace in
      the communal desiring for identity, which she feels across the
      void between her and David.
        - “Queer literature isn’t a box to unlock so that it can
          unlock me. To the very end of Giovanni’s Room, to the
          morning of Giovanni’s death, David remains untouchable, to
          Hella and also to Giovanni, who he has resisted “with all
          [his] strength.” He remains untouchable to himself, too,
          since he doesn’t know what his “body is searching for.” He
          is trapped in a mirror that he longs to “crack” and so “be
          free.” But he is, in a sense, touchable to me, although he
          doesn’t give me either love or affirmation. We can touch
          each other because our knowledge of each other isn’t
          continuous with our knowledge of ourselves. Because we know
          that we can’t free ourselves or each other. We don’t fully
          know who we are, or even quite what we are, and we know no
          final revelation is at hand. Queerness isn’t an identity
          decipherable in a text. It’s something that I desire,
          something never fully here, something given to me daily by
          those who love and name me. It’s a room somewhere slowly
          filling up with light.”

- What do queers read now, or how do queers read now, that the AIDS
  crisis is behind us and it’s been 25 years since Reparative Reading?
  Would This Bridge Called My Back have been published now? The
  article lays out a geneology of queer theory that starts with
  Sedgwick’s reparative reading (focused on the local act of reading)
  then goes into queer of color critique (focused on lived experience
  and social critique), and then sets out a series of essays that
  tries to combine both close reading and social critique.
    - It offers repair as a reading method. Caring for and attending
      to wounds. “To reorganize the lived pain and struggle of its
      potential readers” (178). Building from Sedgwick’s Reparative

      through which readers do something ameliorative with texts,
      making them functional for the nourishing of queer life” (172).
    - Queer reading is a lense not an object, which is tied to the
      reader, “LGBTQ subjectivity”: “one of the field’s most ambitious
      projects has been to reveal the distinct perspective of LGBTQ
      subjectivity as potentially relevant for making sense of all
      forms of cultural production, even those texts, objects, and
      performances that do not appear to have any immediate relation
      to nonnormative sexuality or desire” (171)
- “*Form* — whether understood as the syntactical structure of a
  specific sentence, techniques and devices used to give shape to
  narratives, or the actual visual organization of words on a page —
  can be understood as a kind of *evidence of how queerness is being
  lived and inhabited* by different kinds of LGBTQ people at distinct
  historical moments” (179). --> But is form really pointing to or
  representing reality? Or is it an abstraction?

consciousness of the Borderlands" (77 in old book).

"The ambivalence from the clash of voices results in mental and

and indecisiveness. The mestiza's dual or multiple personality is
plagued by psychic restlessness" (78 in old book).

"The new mestiza copes by developing a tolerance for contradictions, a
tolerance for ambiguity. She learns to be an Indian in Mexican
culture, to be Mexican from an Anglo point of view.  She learns to
juggle cu]tures" (79 in old book).

"The work of mestiza consciousness is to break down the
subject-object duality that keeps her a prisoner and to show in the
flesh and through the images in her work how duality is transcended.
The answer to the problem between the white race and the colored,
between males and females, lies in healing the split that originates in
the very foundation of our lives, our culture, our languages, our
thoughts. A massive uprooting of dualistic thinking in the individual
and collective consciousness is the beginning of a long struggle, but
one that could, in our best hopes, bring us the end of rape, of
violence, of war" (80 in old book).

- Looking at the “division” between aesthetics vs social critique;
  attempting to bring the social critique to aesthetics; and to
  articulate how opacity can be a formal method.
- Form understood as associated with queerness, queer experience, and
  as a way to disrupt easy understanding. Form can be queer and queer
  form can be opaque:
    - “Form informs queerness, and queerness is best understood as a
      series of relations to form, relations not limited to binary and
      adversarial models of resistance and opposition” (228).
    - “Queer form” emerges… as a name for the range of formal,
      aesthetic, and sensuous strategies that make difference a little
      less knowable, visible, and digestible. This special issue makes
      a case for the value of indirection, opacity, and withholding as
      queer strategies for minoritarian art producers” (235).
    - “form focuses attention on how violence—homophobia, racism,
      gentrification, capitalism, and colonialism, for instance—has
      structured conditions of possibility in material and
      epistemological ways” (232).
- Queer form as obscuring, occluding: 
    - “For our purposes, queer form means challenging the primacy of the
      visual, which has too often been a site for pernicious power
      relations… At their base, such operations of surveillance and
      classification rely on the concept of immutable difference, on sharp
      boundaries, and on the possibility of exhaustively knowing the
      other…. We see queer form as an aesthetics that moves persistently
      around the visual, thereby avoiding this flattening. To the extent
      that form operates behind the scenes as ideological impulse and
      materiality, queer formal practices can resist the dictates of
      transparency normally required of non-normative subjects by
      illuminating the unseen. In this way it not only troubles the
      epistemic assurances of the visual regime, but it also asks how
      shifting away from static visuality can circumnavigate questions of
      objectification. A move toward the diffusely sensual, and away from
      the linearity of visual gazing, articulates difference in terms that
      are not about dominance or norms, but that underscore the importance
      of thinking with other modes of knowing, theorizing, and
      experiencing. Queer form is about other ways of understanding
      relationships to power and relationships to being” (232-3)
        - --> This is what is violent about analysis, the assumptions
          that we make about others being fundamentally different and
          fundamentally knowable.
        - --> To me, this connects to what Love talks about queerness as
          being a failed project, an impossibility, as something that
          is always receding just as we are trying to glimpse it. This
          connects to the way we think about quantitative data, data
          analysis. Our data that we use in analysis is never going to
          reflect the complexity of the real object. There is always a
          reduction to be made.

    2008, p. 1-14. Project MUSE muse.jhu.edu/article/241115.

Hartman here looks at the problem of what to do with an absent
archive. Not only absence in the form of evidence, that the literal
records are missing, but also in the tools of expression, in language
that cannot approximate the reality of experience, and in the
discourse that dictates silence. A condition also known as the
"violence of the archive," she describes the archive as a "death
sentence," because it only records the subject in the terms of their
objectification, in "a display of the violated body, an inventory of
property" (2). She seeks to recuperate (without recovering) the lives
of these subjects. To write about them in a way that does not do more
damage, but draws attention to the ways that their lives have been
delineated while inviting possibility for living. To create in the
mode of "critical fabulation" (11).

The violence of the archive: 
- "The archive of slavery rests upon a founding violence. This
  violence determines, regulates and organizes the kinds of statements
  that can be made about slavery and as well it creates subjects and
  objects of power" (10).

She examines the history of Venus, the unnamed slave woman who appears
variously throughout the "official" record. From this history, Hartman
concludes that there is no way forward with recovery. She turns to
consider a series of paradoxical questions:
- “how does one rewrite the chronicle of a death foretold and
  anticipated, as a collective biography of dead subjects, as a
  counter-history of the human, as the practice of freedom?” (3).
- "how does one recuperate lives entangled with and impossible to
  differentiate from the terrible utterances that condemned them to
  death, the account books that identified them as units of value, the
  invoices that claimed them as property, and the banal chronicles
  that stripped them of human features?" (3)
- “How can narrative embody life in words and at the same time respect
  what we cannot Know?” (3).
- “How does one revisit the scene of subjection without replicating
  the grammar of violence?” (4).
- “If it is no longer sufficient to expose the scandal, then how might
  it be possible to generate a different set of descriptions from this
  archive?" (7).

The archivest of slavery comes up against the incommensurability
between reality and the historical record, the archivist must endeavor
to engage this incommensurability: "to expose and exploit the
incommensurability between the experience of the enslaved and the
fictions of history, by which I mean the requirements of narrative,
the stuff of subjects and plots and ends" (10).
- "This double gesture can be described as straining against the
  limits of the archive to write a cultural history of the captive,
  and, at the same time, enacting the impossibility of representing
  the lives of the captives precisely through the process of
  narration" (11).

In the scarcity of material (not one autobiographical account of a
female survives), most of what we have left are numbers. Can we then
fill the void with stories? 
- "Loss gives rise to longing, and in these circumstances, it would
  not be far-fetched to consider stories as a form of compensation or
  even as reparations, perhaps the only kind we will ever receive"
  (4).

- Reading the "surface" to present a self that is plural and opaque,
  inaccessible and excessive.
  - "Harris’s citation of Holiday is... about black femininity and
    understanding the way it functions as a space of otherness within
    Harris’s formulation of selfhood" (par. 7).
  - "What Harris’s citation of Holiday shows us, on the other hand, is
    the ways in which black femininity is always fluid, always
    shifting and never quite attainable. In its impermanence, the
    transformation that Harris enacts is not sincere because it does
    not have depth, but surface in that it relies on and highlights
    the mutability of the flesh rather than interiority. This position
    enlarges what we understand as black femininity. It also,
    importantly, gives us a way to understand citation as a mode of
    inhabitation that shifts the dimensions of selfhood. One does not
    become, but rather one sits alongside the other in citation. This
    alongsideness, in turn, makes it impossible to think of Harris’s
    self-portrait as displaying a sovereign self. Instead, Billie #21
    shows us Holiday and Harris in relation, as a plural self"
    (par. 11).
- An image of Billy Holiday "shows us surface aesthetics in its
  emphasis on shine" (par. 1). 
  - "many of the elements that shine—--pearls, eye shadow, and
    lipstick--—decorate or cover Harris’s body. They alter its surface and
    also make a spectacle of these superficial alterations. Taken
    together these attributes emphasize the ways that surface hints at
    the pleasures of opacity" (par. 2)
  - "Shine also complicates matters because of the way that it is
    imbricated in representations of blackness. Krista A. Thompson
    (2015) argues that the popularity of shine in black diasporic art
    has to do with its ability to thwart intimacy. Shine distracts
    from the mandate of transparency and mobilizes hypervisibility—-the
    cover of surface—-so that interiorities remain opaque. Thompson
    argues that shine enables an “un-visibility,” so that blackness is
    spectacular, but not knowable" (par. 3).
  - "Un-visibility is what happens when we turn commodification and
    objectification on its head... Shine plays joyfully with the idea
    of the body as body while rejecting the demand to present anything
    other than surface" (par. 3).
- Surface is an alternative to objective, essence.
  - "we can understand surface as the underside of the
    scientific/pornographic drive toward locating knowledge in an
    “objective” image" (par. 2)
  - drawing from Anne Anlin Cheng, "This means that surface offers the
    possibility of doubleness, troubling transparency and the idea of
    authenticity. In this way, surface complicates categorization
    because it confounds ideas of what knowledge is, where it lies,
    and how we can apprehend it" (par. 2). 
- Surface as indicator of excess, breaker of subject coherence:
  - "Holiday is iconic; her voice famously layers pain and
    yearning. Billie #21 indexes these histories of wounded fleshiness
    even as it allows us to imagine an inhabitation that exists in
    excess of them, an excess in the voice, an excess of selfhood that
    cannot be fully subsumed by her iconicity and public self. But, it
    is important to remember that the excess that we do witness is
    performed by Harris" (par. 4).
  - "these versions of self-portraiture go beyond mere representation
    and mark *creative forms of expressivity that reveal forms of self
    that exceed capture*...The force of Billie #21, then, emerges in
    our recognition that the photograph is explicitly not revealing
    Harris’s interiority, but that it instead illuminates the
    possibility of reading Harris as a plural self both in relation to
    Holiday through his performance of citation and in relation to the
    otherness of himself that he summons" (par. 6)
  - this performance of surface works against Butler's coherence of
    performance:
    -  "Harris as Holiday is but one momentary surface that we contend
      with. In this way, Harris’s vision of the citational self works
      to reveal the spaces of otherness within the self" (par. 5).
  - "Denise Ferreira da Silva (2013) to argue that the sexual female
    racialized body presents a particular form of disruptive
    excess. This body is excessive because it inhabits the space of
    desiring even as it emerges from a structure that presumptively
    negates access to desire and interiority. This form of
    inhabitation has no mode of expression within the realm of the
    linguistic, however. She describes this “preposed excess” as “the
    violence that is desire itself and the desire that is violence,
    not subjected to the rules of Colonial and Patriarchal
    (re)production” (52)" (par. 9).
- brown jouissance:
  - " In brown jouissance’s emphasis on the mobility of flesh, we are
    given an opportunity to tap into its creative potential. Flesh
    moves; it is always in motion. Its mobility gives us ways to
    imagine otherwise because it emphasizes the contingency and
    liquidity of the world. This is to say that it reminds us that
    flesh is produced on a sea voyage in the waves that separate
    continents and countries. It is in the violence of the whip that
    extracts blood, which renders people closer to animals than
    humans" (18).
  - " Brown jouissance... show[s] us that flesh’s excess produces
    alternate epistemologies while also allowing us to pay attention
    to the violence that produces flesh. We see this in Harris’s
    redirection of sympathy or empathy for Holiday into a meditation
    on hunger and selfhood. The excess of brown jouissance is what
    violence produces and cannot incorporate. In the case of /Billie
    #21/, sticking with the surface--–through the use of Polaroid and
    shine–--illuminates the possibilities of imaging a self whose
    interiority we do not have plumb, but who still generates creative
    possibilities for resisting the mandate of sovereign subjectivity"
    (par. 23).

Brown is re-conceiving sensation and desire to transcend the bounded
subject.

- She asks, “Does the self need bounded wholeness in order to feel, or
  can it thrive in the effluent?” (14). She zeroes in on the
  potentiality of “flesh” as a site that can avoid the “markings” of
  subjectivity: “Flesh… is free of the need for subjectivity. I
  contend that there is freedom in the flesh, in the moments when it
  is excluded from being marked, as it feels, and responds to, touch”
  (11). Sensation, desire, and flesh all reach toward a kind of
  merging.

- Black subjects, being excluded from the ‘human’, have a mobility, an
  ‘untethered state’ (7). “Does the self need bounded wholeness in
  order to feel, or can it thrive in the effluent?” (14).

- “Perhaps we can think of desire differently: not as consumption but
  as relation of and charged with the potential to explode all
  attempts toorder and contain it” (14).

- Sensation is operating as a register. “I was tickled…” (126). 

- P.10-11 “Flesh… is free of the need for subjectivity. I contend that
  there is freedom in the flesh, in the moments when it is excluded
  from marked, as it feels, and responds to, touch” (11).  This
  reminds me of snorton’s transcapable.

Do we hate that she cites Bergson? Do we think that she’s giving a
fair reading to Malabou, unlike Jackson?

Brown points out in Bulter the tension between what in our human
nature allows us to transcend our species and what prevents us from
doing so. Either humanity will “grow” or it will “prevail.

White bodies & gender has been constructed out of black flesh. This
black flesh, which has undergone this reduction, can be a place of
possibility, of fugitivity, of escape, for example.

Snorton suggests that we can get at resistance through the reduction
to flesh, in the concept of the “transcapable”. That the pornotrope
suggests a state of chaos which can resist the fixity of
gender. Looking at the quality that has been used to denigrate as a
tool of empowerment.

Chapter 1: how the field of gynecology, which is about sex/gender in
white women, was only possible by the scopic access to black
flesh. Captive flesh is ungendered.
- Echoes here of Hartman’s method, of critical fabulation. Wondering
  what kinds of ways did the female slaves care for each other during
  the “scientific procedures.” They are the raw materials for creating
  a gender from which they are excluded.
- “The narratives of American gynecology’s founding clarify how
  chattel slavery functioned as one cultural apparatus that brought
  sex and gender into arrangement; the instrument in such an encounter
  occurred in and as flesh” (52).

Chapter 2: how does this state of gender indefiniteness create
possibilities of resistance, of escape? The cross dressing of runaway
slaves.
- “the black’s figurative capacity to change form as a commoditized
  being engendered flow” (59).




*** Jackson, Zakiyyah Iman. /Becoming human: Matter and meaning in an antiblack world/. NYU Press, 2020.

Human–animal dichotomies inscribe, through their hierarchisation,
violent orders.

Humanism emerges from an erasure of black being and knowing.

Toni Morrison’s Beloved shows how the violence of slavery comes from
the insistance on black peoples’ malleability as humans (rather than
animality) into whatever shape it sees fit. Abolitionists used the
Chain of Being as a foundation to base a sentimental argument for the
abolition of slavery. The Chain of Being is actually oppressive,
creating a group that needs to be “protected”.  Putting the bit into
the mouth is the plasticization of the human, this is a violence that
puts the wildness into the human rather than brings it out of the
human. Page 67.

Butler reimagines human subjectivity as not individual but collective,
arising from symbiosis between a variety of bodies and species.
Looking at “receptivity” rather than passivity. Butler doesn’t
idealize symbiosis, but instead looks at how conditions of unequal
power can make it problematic.

Dismantles Enlightenment thought -- saying that blackness has not been
“denied” or “evacuated” but rather reappropriated, plasticized to suit
liberal humanist needs.





*** Lorde, Audre. "Uses of the erotic: the erotic as power." Sister
    Outsider (1984), pp. 53-59. 

Need to reclaim the erotic as a source of power, empowerment through
desire and joy.

The difference between the erotic and the pornographic: both have to
do with pleasure, but the pornographic supresses feeling, pursuing
only sensation.

pornographic → flesh; erotic → feeling in flesh
What we think is the pornographic has potential to be the erotic. 

“The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of our sense of self
and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of
satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it, we know we can
aspire” (54).

“erotic… is a question of how actually and fully we can feel in the
doing” (54). 

Quantity vs quality: “There is a difference between painting a back
fence and writing a poem, but only one of quantity. And there is, for
me, no difference between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight
against the body of a woman l love” (58).

Trans Studies founders because of the academy that cannot fund
scholars who therefore cannot afford to write. Those in positions of
power therefore hire queer theorists to do trans work. 

Normativity is actually discussed often. See Prosser. 

We want the field to be a shelter, not a battleground. Trans Studies
needs to be cultivated, a "not yet here" like Munoz. 

--> Munoz's concept of queerness as desire is not something that Chu
engages with. The desire for what is not yet here is both radical and
conforming, because it aspires toward the utopian, the
collectivity. There seems to be a lot of crossover here.

*** Keegan, Cáel M., Against Queer Theory. TSQ 1 August 2020; 7 (3):
349–353. doi: https://doi.org/10.1215/23289252-8552978

Although trans studies has had to define itself against queer, they
are actually working in tandem, and depend on each other. The burden
of the trans is to live and work within the queer as guiding
conditions. To always be "against" the queer.

"One thing we might want from trans studies now is further
conversation about how to be up against the impossible project of
recognition on these terms: how to live and make work inside these
abrasive conditions, how to remain willing to engage in the service of
“a new hope” (Snorton 2009: 88)—even when it feels like our back is
against the door" (352).

*** Chu, Andrea Long, and Emmett Harsin Drager. "After trans studies."
  Transgender Studies Quarterly 6.1 (2019): 103-116.

According to Chu, the main desire for trans folks is normativity, and
this is something that queer studies does not grapple with. So far, it
is just extending queer's project of boundary-crossings. 

Trans Studies is a follower when it latches on to Queer Studies's need
for radicalism, for boundary crossing, for constant "queering", for
the "romance of criticism as a radical political act". 

- "Trans Studies requires that we understand--as we never have before--
what it means to be attached to a norm, by desire, but habit, by
survival" (108).

Trans folks desire the normative. They want the house in
Westchester. It is the journey toward the normative that is
nonnormative for them. 

Drager: Trans Studies needs to ask controversial questions like should
children be given hormones, is transitioning going to fis dysphoria?

Stone's "Empire" calls on folks to resist narratives of
medicalization, of passing & authenticity, and to instead look for the
"post-transsexual," who is nonmedicalized and nonauthentic. But this
is where trans studies dies: "there is an obsession with resistance &
radicality that has severly limited our ability to fully understand
trans pasts and presents" (107). We need something that examines what
happens when we do not get what we want, something messy, complicated,
disappointing, unexpected. Satire, not tragedy or romance.

*** Halberstam, Jack. "Nice trannies." Transgender Studies Quarterly
7.3 (2020): 321-331.

Chu willfully misreads Trans Studies, its disagreements, its
significant debates. We are not all females. The Lesbian Phallus
disproves female as a lack. Butler already has done what Trans Studies
is trying to do. Our enemy should be men, not butches. The
beneficiaries of hetero-patriarchy.

Why does Chu hate butches? (probably because they disavow their
femininity?) 

*** Travers, Travers. "Trans Studies and Resistance in an Academy
Based on Masculinity Contest Culture." TSQ: Transgender Studies
Quarterly 7.3 (2020): 407-420.

Academic culture continues to be hostile to trans femmes, and
particularly trans femmes of color, via "modern/neoliberal
organizational logics" (409). Organizational cultures are masculinity
contests. Masculine modes are rewarded while feminine ones are
penalized. 

We need to center BIPOC femmes and children. We need to continue to
document how masculinity and contest culture has necropolitical
consequences. 

*** Prosser, Jay. /Second Skins: The Body Narratives of
Trannsexuality/, Columbia U Press, 1998. 

Prosser's main argument is that queer theory, and gender
performativity in particular, has relied on transgender
identification in ways that elide the specificity of the trans body. 

"The question of how to represent the narratives of
transsexuality... to put into narrative its remarkable bodily
trajectories" (4). 

Goal is to read the materiality of transsexual body into narratives:
"To bring into view the mateirality of the body" (12).  

Critique of Butler and queer theory generally: Butler considers
"transitions as discursive but not explored in the bodiliness of
gendered crossings" (6). 

Butler's work considers gender, not sex, crossings, sex is "what was
beneath the favored terrain of performativity" (6). Transsexuality is
about embodiment. 
- "deliteralization of sex" - displaced from materiality to fantacized
  surface.
- on "Gender is Burning" in BTM: "According to Butler, transgressive
crossings can simultaneously reinscribe symbolic norms" (45). There is
a "metaphorization of the transsexual body" (55). If Venus got her sex
change, she would cease to be subversive" (49). This is a "critical
perversity" (49). 

Queer studies has depended on the transgender, has relied on
transgender desires (21).

Critique of Sedgwick: Theorizing about homosexuality relies on
cross-gendered identifications. In /Between Men/, normative sexuality
depends on male identification, and the avowal of such, with women as
objects of desire (22). 



Criticism:

"transsexuality's somatic transitions are spurred and enabled by the
formal transitions of narrative... Sex change is a plot... [Prosser's
book suggests transsexuality, with its extraordinary conjunctions of
body and narrative, as an identity story that transitions across the
body/language divide that currently stalls poststucturalist thought."

From Judith Halberstam's review: 

  Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality. Jay Prosser
  Trans Liberation: Beyond Pink or Blue. Leslie Feinberg FTM:
  Female-to-Male Transsexuals in Society. Holly Devor Judith Halberstam
  /Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society/ 2000 26:1, 313-317

  "Jay Prosser delineates three major areas for discussion: first,
  the (mis)representation of the transgender body within queer theory
  as a privileged example of gender performativity" (313).

   "In a discussion of poststructuralist treatments of the transsexual
   body, Prosser vigorously contests the notion that the body is
   simply an inscribed surface or a discursive effect; such a reading
   of the body becomes particularly problematic for the transsexual
   whose desire for a sex change suggests a return to the literal, the
   real, the intractable flesh" (314).

   "In a dense and complex chapter on the work of Judith Butler,
   Prosser argues that her texts, central as they are to queer theory,
   simultaneously invoke and repudiate the transsexual body as a
   figure for gender crossing.  In Gender Trouble, Prosser argues, the
   transgender figures of the drag queen and the butch lesbian "come
   to appear the empirical subjects of gender performativity, their
   crossing illustrating both the inessentiality of sex and the
   nonoriginality of heterosexuality that was the book's thesis"
   (26). And yet, when Butler shifts her gaze from the transgender
   figure to the transsexual in /Bodies That Matter/, the transsexual
   represents a limit to performativity. Prosser claims that, while
   transgender and queer may be allied in Butler's work, transsexual
   and queer are most certainly in opposition.  Prosser's reading of
   Butler is crucial to the political stakes of his book.  In true
   deconstructive fashion, he aims his critical attention at Butler's
   mis- reading of a footnote in Freud about the relationship between
   body and ego. When she misreads /ego/ as /body/, Prosser claims,
   Butler dematerializes the body as a fantasy/fiction of the ego
   while Freud wanted to make the body the materialization of the
   psyche. This misreading sets up a series of priorities for queer
   performativity that are all at odds with transsexuality.
   Accordingly, Prosser understands queer theory to validate surface
   over depth, gender over sex, fiction over the real, the visual over
   the felt, the queer over the heterosexual. "In its representation
   of sex as a figurative effect of straight gender's constative
   performance," he claims, "/Gender Trouble/ cannot account for the
   transsexual desire for sexed embodiment S I G N S Autumn 2000 1 315
   /telos/" (33). I think Prosser's reading of Butler is compelling,
   and it is partic- ularly persuasive when Prosser tackles the most
   problematic chapter in /Bodies That Matter/, a close reading of the
   limits of performativity in relation to the transsexual drag queens
   in Jennie Livingston's film /Paris is Burning/." (314-315)

** Archives

discussion. Radical History Review, 2015(122),

This roundtable discusses the "archival turn" in queer studies, and
questions the methods, subjects, investments of queer archival
studies. 

Tavia Nyong'O: "I have never really deviated from the formative
impression Foucault gave that what I should expect from the archive is
the estrangement of myself and others, or that I could call that
estrangement queer" (216).  

"The incommensurable for Muñoz points to differences that cannot be
subsumed under a single term (much as queer ephemerality cannot be
fully appropriated to the logic of the archive) but that can
nevertheless be shared out. The incommensurable points to the spaces
between us, across which we touch and are touched. It sounds a little
poetic, but that is my preferred image for how queer activism and art
can encounter each other without becoming each other" (226).


From “Editor’s Introduction”:

"The business of knowing is unsteady": 
- "Fragments of information float unfixed — historically unraveled —
  and we form archives when we pull the fragments into the orbit of
  efforts to know. Yet the business of knowing is unsteady, as
  scholars of sexuality and gender have amply demonstrated.  Between
  the fraught and necessary practices historicization, anachronism,
  interpretation, bias, and partial readings that propel historical
  scholarship, archival fragments fall in and out of the frame of an
  easily perceptible knowledge" (1).

The archive is the site of a tension between "intimate tracing" and
"historical unravelling"
- "This tension of knowledge production in the archive — this
  dialectical drama of intimate tracing and historical unraveling — is
  what produces the archive as a compelling time and space for
  witnessing the mechanics of queer knowledge production" (2).

- "the profile of the queer archive as a site for the repetitive,
radical defamiliarization of knowledge" (introduction, 7) 

** Historiography
*** Goldberg, Menon "Queering History" Goldberg, Jonathan, and
Madhavi Menon. “Queering History.” PMLA, vol. 120, no. 5, 2005,
pp. 1608–1617

Their position is that historiography demarcates the queer in a way
that normativizes queer. They resist the idea that queerness is
different across time, while also resisting that we can ever /know/
queerness. 


"unhistoricism... history as it is hegemonically understood today is
inadequate to housing the project of queering. In opposition to a
history based on hetero difference, we propose homohistory... with all
its connotations of sameness, similarity, proximity, and anachronism"
(1609).

"similarity should lead not to identity but rather to the non
self-identical nonpresent" (1609).

"the impossibility of the final difference between, say, sodomy and
homosexuality, even as it gestures toward the impossibility of final
definition that both concepts share" (1609).
** Autobiography Theory
*** Lejeune, Philippe, Annette Tomarken and Edward Tomarken. "Autobiography in the Third Person." /New Literary History/, Vol. 9, No 1, pp. 27-50. 
- "Every speaker bears within him two polarities, that of sender and
  receiver and that of enunciation and statement. He rests on a
  scission. Or rather, he does not 'rest' (implying a paradoxical
  stability); he functions by virtue of this schism. "The individual
  is a dialogue," Valery used to say. Communication is thusa 'dialogue
  of dialogues'; the entire theory of enunciation will have to be
  reforumated in view of the hypothesis that each 'role' already
  contains the sum of roles--an endless procedure. From these
  reflections one can draw the conclusion that when an autobiographer
  speaks to us about himself in the third person, or talks about
  himself in the second person, he is certainly using a figure, so far
  as standard usage is concerned, but that this figure initiates a
  return to a fundamental situation, tolerable only if read as being
  figured. Generally, these sunderings, divisions, and confrontations
  are both expressed and masked by the use of a single 'I'" (30).
- "The first person, then, always conceals a hidden third person, and
  in this sense every autobiography is by definition indirect. But in
  the third-person autobiographies I am going to present, this
  indirectness is admitted, is boldly proclaimed. The procedure is
  felt to be artificial because it destroys that illusory effect of
  the first person which makes us take the indirect for the direct"
  (32).
- "It is as if, in autobiography, no combination of the personal
  pronouns could 'fully express' the person in a satisfactory
  manner. Or rather, to put it less naively, all imaginable
  combinations reveal, with differing degrees of clarity, the nature
  of the person--the tension between impossible unity and intolerable
  division and the fundamental schism which turns the speaker into a
  fugitive" (32).
- "One cannot get outside oneself, i.e., represent on equal terms with
  one's own point of view an attitude different from one's own. The
  articulation of two truly different points of view concerning a
  single individual cannot be accomplished in autobiography. The
  novelist, however, can create a double perspective but only by
  sacrificing reality (omniscience and 'nonfocalization' are
  impossible outside fiction)"(41)
** Protomodernist Aestheticizations
*** Wilde, Oscar. The Picture of Dorian Gray. 1890, 1891 & MS.

MS & 1890:
- Wilde codes or obscures references to homosexuality and
  homoeroticism---the deep intimacy between Lord Henry and Basil;
  removes suggestsion in Basil's devotion of fatality and intensity
  toward Dorian; frames Dorian as an aesthetic rather than erotic
  object.
    - The first chapter:
        - Suppresses intimacy between Lord Henry and Basil, touching,
          shaking off hands.
        - Neutralizes or replaces tense mood or dramatic interactions
          with playful banter and laughter---no low voices, switches
          murmurs for laughs; "look of pain" to "perplexity"; "look"
          to "glance"; "passion" to "feeling"; "mad" to "reckless".
        - Tense or confessional tone becomes confusion or
          exasperation.
        - Dorian's abstract allure becomes rerouted toward specific
          attributes; he becomes an aesthetic rather than erotic
          object---"beauty" to "personality", or "good looks";
          "extraordinary romance" to "curious artistic idolatry".
        - Basil's fatal obsession becomes an aesthetic devotion.
        - Basil's suffering/jealousy about Dorian is completely cut.
- Disagreement about the "Moral":
    - While critics thought that the story celebrates hedonistic
      lifestyles, Wilde asserts that the story condemns "excess and
      renunciation", and that this moral was "too obvious". In letters
      to the editor, defending his work, Wilde discusses the need to
      suppress the "obvious moral"---"that all excess, as well as all
      renunciation, brings about its own punishment" (Letter to
      St. James Gazette). He says the existence of the moral is an
      artistic error.
    - Wilde then begins the process of revising the novel so that the
      didactic is subordinated to the aesthetic. For this revision,
      Dorian is turned from an erotic to an aesthetic object.
    - When I was 16 I read this book as an encouragement to
      hedonism. It made me obsessed with youth and beauty. Now when I
      reread the book in my twenties I see that the moral is about the
      dangers of living a closeted lifestyle. Lord Henry is not
      telling Dorian to be vain, but telling him to embrace his sexual
      awakening, to not let society shame him into hiding.

1891: Dorian becomes thoroughly corrupt, the ending rewritten so he
appears monstrous and with no remorse. The middle parts, the subplot
with James Vane, was added to make Dorian more of a villain.  The
preface is also added to solidify the book as an aesthetic object.

*** Pater, Walter. *Studies of the History of the Renaissance*. 1873.
- For Pater, criticism is an individual sensation, an 'impressionist'
  mode, an erotic encounter between subject and object, past and
  present. He goes against criticism as an act of intellectual
  apprehension (Ruskin & Arnold). He was looking to Renaissance
  artists (Botticelli) who in turn looked to Hellenistic ideas to heal
  the rupture between body and mind.
    - The *Studies* is an attempt to educate the senses, sensibility
      to experience aesthetics as an erotic encounter. This ultimately
      positions the viewer as a recepticle for impressions. Pater's is
      an *aesthetics of the bottom*. Aesthetic appreciation is being
      receptive to the forces of beauty emanating from the
      object. This is an erotic experience. You need to be the bottom,
      rather than the top (like Arnold and Ruskin, objectivist,
      intellectual).
        - There are parallels here with neuroscience and the way that
          the mind/brain functions. What Pater describes is core
          consciousness, which is a relation between the organisim and
          the object, mixed with extended consciousness, which is the
          emergence of a self. There is a recursive feed of
          information from the object, which the organism continually
          processes, and then that object's engagement with
          images/feelings. Core consciousness is concerned with
          presence and feeling in the moment, and extended with
          pulsations of core over time. It seems that he's continually
          trying to get back to the core consciousness, but cannot
          help the influence of the extended.*
- His prose is driven and dripping with affect---longing, nostalgia,
  eroticism.
    - "Painful sense of aspiration".
    - "penetrate"; "discriminate"; :power of being deeply moved";
      "susceptibility"; recepticle"; "curious"; "does it give me
      pleasure?"
    - "charm of ascesis: of the austere and serious girding of the
      loins in youth" (5). A self restraint that makes one more
      sensitive, more discriminating.
- Michaelangelo:
    - "No one ever expressed more truly than Michaelangelo the notion
      of inspired sleep, of faces charged with dreams" (44).
- Leonardo:
    - "Through his strange veil of sight things reach him so; in no
      ordinary night or day, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in
      some brief interval of falling rain at daybreak, or through deep
      water. And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human
      personality and became above all a painter of portraits; faces
      of a modelling more skilful than has been seen before or since,
      embodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion on dark
      air" (63).
- Botticelli:
    - "He paints the story of the goddess of pleasure in other
      episodes besides that of her birth from the sea, but never
      without some shadow of death in the grey flesh and wan
      flowers. He paints Madonnas, but they shrink from the pressure
      of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable undertones for a
      warmer, lower humanity" (34).
        - "The light is indeed cold—--mere sunless dawn; but a later
          painter would have cloyed you with sunshine; and you can see
          the better for that quietness in the morning air each long
          promontory, as it slopes down to the water's edge. Men go
          forth to their labours until the evening; but she is awake
          before them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face
          was at the thought of the whole long day of love yet to
          come.... Botticelli meant all that imagery to be altogether
          pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness of
          resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that
          subdued and chilled it; but his predilection for minor tones
          counts also; and what is unmistakable is the sadness with
          which he has conceived the goddess of pleasure, as the
          depositary of a great power over the lives of men" (31).

*** Field, Michael. *Sight and Song*. 1892. 
- Written by collaborative poets, Edith Cooper and Katherine Bradley,
  writing together as Michael Field. Consists of 31 "picture-poems" or
  ekphrastic exercises, on famous paintings from the Italian
  Renaissance in galleries across Western Europe. The poems range in
  form, but seem to all be variations of sonnets.
- Ekphrastic exercise:
    - The poems resist and critique Victorian ideologies about women
      by reclaiming previously objectified female subjectivity. This
      is proto-queer and proto-feminist. They anticipate
      feminist/queer strategies of seeing. They play the instability
      of language against the apparent stability of images; using
      poetry to "revise" rather than "describe"
      paintings. Interestingly, contemporary reviews thought the poems
      too descriptive, that they describe the paintings in too much
      detail as to rob poetry of its creative spirit. Like a guidebook
      or catalogue in verse. ("every detail of the picture is most
      insisted upon").
- I read these poems not as exercises in subjective withholding
  (Pater) but as exercises in inquiry, where the viewer interrogates
  and therefore destabilizes the popular stories and themes they
  represent. The speaker in the poems imagines new narratives to
  replace the old ones of female objectivity and passivity. They shift
  perspectives to overturn implied and normalized ideologies of
  objectification. A woman's rescue is turned into a man's; a scene of
  rape is turned into a scene of appreciating sexless beauty. Language
  unsettles the image, making its narrative assumptions explicit and
  revising them. We ought to read the poems first then look at the
  paintings.
- Tintoretto's "The Rescue" --- shows Arsinoe fleeing from the seige
  of Alexandria. In the poem, Arsinoe achieves agency and control over
  her own naked body, which she uses to stablize the man "rescuing"
  her who is dazzled by her beauty, "maintains his form"; as well as
  using nakedness to overcome her physical restraints: "her bondage
  irks not"; shortening the title to the "rescue" rather than "rescue
  of arsinoe" makes the object of rescue ambiguous.
- Correggio's "Antiope" --- while the painting presents a clear scene
  of voyeurism, the poem nearly omits Zeus's presence, and casts him
  as a curious appreciatior of Antiope's beauty rather than a
  rapist. In removing her cloak, Zeus covers her body with visual
  admiration. His gaze precludes sexual desire, and she retains the
  innocence of her sleepy state, which is the main focus of the
  poem. A visual admiration distinct from sexual desire "love's
  flambeau dies". Revises a myth of rape to a scene of loveliness,
  tenderness, admiration: "beauty franchised".

** Modernist Self-Referential Modes
*** Woolf, Virginia. *Orlando*, 1928 & *A Writer's Diary*, 1953 & "A Sketch of the Past," 1939.

/Writer's Diary/:

- Her diary shows a struggle to find a form that will transcend time,
  the passage of time, in order to confront "reality", *the core
  self*, though she remains within the realm of *the extended*, the
  realm of language. Her goal is to make language do the work of the
  core. To make language present and immediate.
    - "Going at such a pace as I do I must make the most direct and
      instant shots at my object, and thus have to lay my hand on
      words, choose them and shoot them with no more pause than is
      needed to put my pen in ink" (13).
    - [on *Jacob's Room*] "Suppose one thing should open out of
      another... the looseness and the lightness.... enclose
      everything, everything? ... no scaffolding, scarcely a brick to
      be seen; all crepuscular, but the heart, the passion, humour,
      everything as bright as fire in the mist" (22).
    - [on *Mrs Dalloway*] "My discovery: how I dig out beautiful caves
      behind my characters. The idea is that the caves shall connect
      and each comes to daylight in the present moment" (59).
        - *Here she is including the extended consciousness, she wants
          to include the past and the future, but someone collapsing
          them into the core.*
    - "Suppose we could... catch them [thoughts] hot and sudden as
      they rise in the mind... One must stop to find a word" (94-95).
        - This is the exact *tension between the core and the
          extended* in *the writing self*. She wants to catch the
          thought as it occurs, but finds that she needs language to
          do so. Language removes her from the immediacy of the
          thing. *The transitive has not yet arrived to its
          substantive form*.
    - "One sees a fin passing far out. What image can I reach to
      convey what I mean?... the essence of reality. I used to feel
      this as a child---couldn't step across a puddle once, I
      remember, for thinking how strange---what am I?" (100).
        - Looking for images to convey reality, when reality is not
          seen as images, it's experienced as feelings (Damasio). This
          explains why Woolf is struggling---she's using a reflexive
          form (language) in order to convey immediate
          sensations. This is her main obsession.
    - [on *The Waves*] "Time shall be utterly obliterated; future
      shall somehow blossom out of the past. One incident--say the
      fall of a flower--might contain it" (101).
        - She is stumbling toward a form, a style that will allow her
          to sustain herself in the eternal present, to obliterate
          time and self.
    - "What a little I can get into my pen what is so vivid to my
      eyes, and not only to my eyes; also to some nervous fibre, or
      fanlike membrane in my species" (128).
    - "I believe these illnesses are in my case--how shall I express
      it--partly mystical. Something happens in my mind. It refuses to
      go on registering impressions. It shuts itself up. It becomes
      chrysalis" (150).
        - Her illnesses (weeks-months of debilitation) show how living
          in the present, receiving impressions, is stressful and
          tiring business.

/Orlando/:

- If Orlando has a thesis, it is this----there is no truth, there is
  no gender, but what we make of it. It is up to the individual human
  to find meaning and connection and definition. The truth therefore
  relies on fiction, on fantasy and imagination.
- She illustrates this perfectly with two scenes from the second and
  sixth chapters. This would be the quintessential scenes portraying
  how Orlando’s character has grown beyond a disappointment in the
  limitations of language for expression to a new faith in it.
    - First, Orlando (having just been betrayed by her lover Sasha)
      struggles to write poetry. She cannot comprehend whether plain
      english (“the sky is blue; the grass is green”) is preferable to
      figurative language (“she sky is like the veils which a thousand
      Madonnas have let fall from their hair; the grass fleets and
      darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy
      satyrs from enchanted woods”). Both are false for Orlando.
    - Then, in chapter six, Orlando watches a toy boat negotiate a
      wavelet on the Serpentine river in London. The boat is
      momentarily submerged and then emerges on the other side of the
      wavelet. She associates this with the word “ecstasy”, and
      hurries to telegram the phrase, ‘a toy boat on the serpentine’
      and ‘ecstasy’, to her lover, who she knows will immediately
      understand what it means. As she hurries to the post office, she
      meditates on the nature of language and literature, which she
      now realizes is violently ecstatic. The toy boat now has the
      power to signify.
        - The symmetry of these two episodes shows how Orlando’s new
          perspective on language, her faith in language, endows it
          with the power to mean.
- The role of time in mediating the story ---
    - Orlando is out of time, in a literal sense, her biological body
      transcends the passage of time, and in a social sense, she does
      not fit into the traditional social structures or “reproductive
      time” of British society.
    - She cannot face the present---when the clock strikes the
      “present moment” in the sixth chapter, it is a violent
      experience for Orlando. The biographer quickly passes on from
      this moment to continue narrating the events of the story. This
      meaning is that the present moment is very difficult to be
      in. It is difficult to be in the present. The only reason we
      survive the shock is because we have the past on one side and
      the future on the other to muffle it.
    - “All is still now” --- there is a transcendence of time as
      linear, to time as simultaneity, at the end of the story. The
      pun on the word “still”, meaning that in moments of quietness
      and calmness we find simultaneity. Ghosts will come out of the
      past.

"A Sketch of the Past":

- Written close to the end of her life, we get the fullest sense of
  her creative process and how she engages the present, or
  "reality". Here, she describes how she handles these overwhelming
  experiences with reality, which is by ordering them through
  language. She has found her method--the passage from the core to the
  extended selves. It relies on finding a form, creating a structure,
  an order, for her experiences.
    - The way that she describes her impressions is ecological--the
      "violent shocks" that she "explains" or "transmutes" into
      writing are largely derived from nature, mediated by her
      interactions with nature, be it place or vegetation.
        - The environment is a container for feeling, and she
          speculates that strong emotions can be preserved in
          places--"I shall turn up August 1890" (67); one day, she
          will fit a plug in the wall.
        - She is very connected to plants, the flowerbed, ecstasy at
          seeing a whole (71) and the appletree, horror at confronting
          suicide, "paralysis" (71).
- These intense moments of experiencing reality she calls "moments of
  being" (opposed to nonbeing). This is the violent shock, blow, from
  the outside world. Woolf writes in order to mitigate the shocks, to
  explain them, putting them into an order. She finds great pleasure
  in the writing.
    - *Writing is a form of displacement, the inscription displaces
      the primal experience of sensation.*
- "Hamlet or a Beethoven quartet is the truth about this vast mass
  that we call the world. But there is not Shakespeare, there is no
  Beethoven, certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the
  words, we are the music; we are the thing itself. And I see this
  when I have a shock" (72).
- TIME "as a platform to stand upon" --- time as a formal device for
  portraying a dynamic selfhood. Chronological time structures the
  unfolding of the narrative, and also serves as a vantage that
  collapses the juxtaposition between selves.
- COLOR initiates and situates her memories; evokes the intensity of
  their feeling. "Rapture" in pale yellow, greens and silvers about
  the memory at St Ives; "ecstasy" in red and purple on a black
  background, her mother's dress, her first memory.

*** Stein, Gertrude. "Lifting Belly," 1989 & *Tender Buttons*, 1914 & *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas*, 1933.

Lifting Belly
- First impression --- this doesn’t make any sense, and is completely
  arbitrary. Then upon reading further start to see and to pick out
  the lines of narrative here. Reading Stein is like tuning to a
  radio. At first it doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t have narrative,
  but sentences one after another, a parataxis. Then after you read a
  while you start to get a repertoire of the sounds and rhythms. A
  cumulative effect. And you start to notice the patterns and if you
  follow the patterns it starts to coalesce, to make sense. One
  pattern echoes in another. This is finding patterns in randomness.
- Then once you’ve found the patterns your reading turns into a kind
  of tuning, like a radio, where you hear and interpret various
  frequencies. There are many frequencies running through the
  text. The frequency of mode---declarative, interrogative,
  imperative. The frequency of sentence structure, of starting with
  subjects or conjunctions or prepositions. The frequencies of
  sounds---come out cow. Then you become like the radio that sounds
  out these patterns into meanings. Listening becomes a tuning in.

Tender Buttons
- The title of the book is an oxymoron. This conveys a gradation to
  something that is binary. A button is not a dial. Buttons can be
  pressed or not pressed. On or off. Tender to me means that it can be
  pressed lightly, slowly, withholdingly. It also endows an affect,
  “soft” or “vulnerable” or even “painful”.
- This book is harder to read than the others. I felt here she is
  trying out a style that she then perfects in Lifting Belly. It is
  very difficult to concentrate here. I’m not sure how I should be
  reading---fast or slow, one word at a time or by phrase or by
  sentence, out loud or in my mind.
    - *I read slow and close so that my saccades only process one word
      at a time. This is pleasurable because each word is new and
      unexpected. This is the reveling in the actions of the
      letterbox.*
        - This is about looking at language. Really seeing it for what
          it is when we put it in new and unexpected contexts. Words
          in the end have nothing to do with things. This is, as so
          many have said before, verbal cubism. The number one thing I
          realize is the complete defamiliarization of language.
        - But it is also more than that. It is about how the brain
          makes meaning, piece by piece, finding coherence in
          fragments. This writing resists coherence and makes us
          engage with the fragments on their own. Language does not
          describe things. The strangeness of language is cloaked by
          its meaning. We do not encounter the strangeness of language
          like this by day.
Autobiography
- Why write an autobiography of another person? Because that is how we
  can deconstruct (and therefore portray) personality.
    - Stein here takes an outside view of herself by imagining
      Toklas’s interiority. She comes at herself by practicing a
      rhythm of speech. By getting into the habit of Toklas’s thinking
      and Toklas’s vision, she can get at herself, Gertrude
      Stein. Orlando, by contrast, gets at the other by imagination,
      speculation. She takes allegory and fantasy as tools.
        - Woolf: it is impossible to know another, so we might as well
          make it up.
        - Stein: that it is impossible to know another person, so we
          must have recourse to what we see, and practice the patterns
          of vision and speech.  Stein is serious about inhabiting
          Toklas to see herself. She avoids emotion and
          exceptionality, she is interested in the common and the
          everyday use of speech. She is interested in the rhythms of
          plain English.
- Copying / Dusting / Painting / Writing are all a rhythm bound
  aesthetic activity. Getting into the rhythm of the visual, becoming
  more interested in the outside of things, being tormented by their
  relationship to the internal.
    - “It was a long tormenting process, she looked, listened, and
      described. She always was, and always is, tormented by the
      problem of the internal and the external… the human being is
      essentially not paintable” (119).
        - *Identifies the problem between the material and the
          immaterial. Stein’s solution is the practice the rhythms of
          vision and description. She is trying to deconstruct this
          process.*
    - The act of copying, dusting, proofreading. “Describing the
      inside as seen from the outside” (156). A way to embody the
      rhythms of the object. Toklas repeatedly asserts that copying,
      proofreading, dusting allows her to know a work of art.
        - Etta Cone copying Three Lives is juxtaposed with Picasso
          painting Stein. Cone says she must copy letter by letter so
          that she does not understand the meaning of the words. Then
          Picasso says he can no longer paint Stein because he no
          longer sees her when he looks at her. The painting is left
          as it is.
        - The connection between patterns and vision, in patterns
          coalescing into vision, but not in any way connected to
          meaning. All is connected to seeing only. This is why
          Picasso can no longer paint Gertrude, because he can no
          longer see the whole but only the pattern. The painting is
          finished.
            - *This connects directly to Dahaene’s letterbox and the
              deconstruction of vision into visual uptake, identifying
              letters, identifying words, and only then feeding the
              words up the brain to meaning.*
    - “I always say that you cannot tell what a picture really is or
      what an object really is until you dust it every day and you
      cannot tell what a book is until you type it or proofread it. It
      then does something to you that only reading can never do”
      (113).
        - You must practice, embody, the outside to get at the inside
          of things. This was her revelation with Tender Buttons. “In
          these studies she began to describe the inside as seen from
          the outside” (156).

*** Barnes, Djuna. *Nightwood*. 1936.
- Lots of parallels to Dorian Gray in the transmission history, where
  homosexual elements are coded or cut out, and adding a preface to
  orient readership toward the aesthetic qualities of the novel rather
  than the subversive qualities.
    - Transmission history involves Emily Coleman (friend) and TS
      Eliot (critic and editor at Faber & Faber). They edited down the
      novel to less than half its size, where it stayed until the
      1990s when Cheryl Plumb’s archival work on the Dalkey Edition
      reinstated Barnes’ typescript. Here’s what happened:
        -  Barnes sends Coleman the TS, who edits it, going back and
          forth with Barnes via correspondence. Then, Coleman decides
          to send the TS to Eliot, but cuts several pages of dialogue
          (an area of B’s writing she especially did not appreciate)
          before doing so.  Eliot accepts the manuscript, which
          initiates a new stage of revision, the effects of which has
          been a popular topic of disagreement among Barnes’s critics,
          particularly whether Eliot was the manuscript’s savior or
          its enemy:
    - To Preface or Not to Preface ---
        - Paralleling here with Dorian Gray. It insists on reading the
          novel as an aesthetic object---to consider the stylistic and
          poetic excesses of the novel, which critics argue would
          preclude it from being targeted by obscenity laws. Eliot’s
          preface diverted attention away from content to style.
            - “Only those sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly
              appreciate it”
- Potentialized Images --
    - The general feeling when I read this book is that all of the
      images are vital in some way, there is something alive about
      them. Joseph Frank describes the “spatial” aspect of the book
      like a lighthouse light that revolves across different parts of
      the same human entanglement. But I think it’s more like a
      strobe/spot light that flashes on temporary (possibly illusory)
      imaginings and scenes. We get a quick succession of images, most
      of them don’t make traditional sense, we are not even sure if we
      saw them.
        - *The effect of this is that the final image, or “resting
          place” is now tinged with all these potential flashes and
          imaginings (James)*.
    - The way that the sentence structure works enacts this flashing
      of light---we get clause upon clause of similitude that doesn’t
      really --- it doesn’t make any sense. But by the time we get to
      the subject, the thing being described, it is layered by all
      these mysterious suggestions.
        - William James explains that “The rush of the thought is so
          headlong that it almost always brings us up at the
          conclusion before we can arrest it. Or if our purpose is
          nimble enough and we do arrest it, it ceases forthwith to
          become itself” (237). Assessing an object’s potentiality is
          the mind’s way realizing the object. In language, this
          process is located in the similitude, or an analogy between
          two distinct objects.
    - Throughout Nightwood, sentence structures, conjunctions, and
      prepositions create a “ratio” of sensations by assembling and
      organizing the data antecedent to the subject. The resulting
      image is thereby layered with previous data.
        - “As the altar of a church would present but a barren
          stylization but for the uncalculated offerings of the
          confused and humble; as the corsage of a woman is made
          suddenly martial and sorrowful by the rose thrust among the
          more decorous blooms by the hand of a lover suffering the
          violence of the overlapping of the permission to bestow a
          last embrace, and its withdrawal: making a vanishing and
          infinitesimal bull's eye of that which had a moment before
          been a buoyant and showy bosom, by dragging time out of his
          bowels (for a lover knows two times, that which he is given,
          and that which he must make)--so Felix was astonished to
          find that the most touching flowers laid on the altar he had
          raised to his imagination were placed there by the people of
          the underworld, and that the reddest was to be the rose of
          the doctor.” (34).
            - The initial similes, “as the altar of a church…. as the
              corsage of a woman” spin into further comparisons: the
              description of a rose being thrust by a rejected lover
              upon his beloved then becomes “an infinitesimal bull’s
              eye,” the receding view of that which he has just been
              denied. The second half of this complex sentence,
              following the dash, finally brings the subject into
              view. Here, the previous descriptions of flowers are
              tied to Felix’s feelings (he is “astonished”) about the
              doctor’s significance to “his imagination.”
            - Profusion of images, delay of subject. Similitude and
              syntax work together to narrativize an image. The
              clauses, which are mostly adjectival phrases, anticipate
              the subject by suffusing its absence with details---or
              data---about associations.
                - Also recalls a combination of Damasio's "felt
                  images" floating up to consicousness, Shaviro's
                  "aesthetic semblances" as a way of knowing through
                  feeling, Whitehead's "potenatilized actualities",
                  Powers's on learning as "associations of
                  associations". The idea is that what we see is
                  actually suffused with emotions in the body which
                  arise as feelings in the mind. Breaking down the
                  process of thinking into one of feeling.

*** Mansfield, Katherine. "Bliss," 1918 & *The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks*. 2002.
/The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks/
- The mix of fatalism and vitality in her writing --- her writing is a
  life force but she also suggests being haunted by death ---
    - “I want to write a book---that is unreal yet wholly possible
      because out of the question---that raises in the hearts of the
      readers emotions, sensations too vivid not to take effect, which
      causes a thousand delicate tears, a thousand sweet chimes of
      laughter. I shall never attempt anything approaching the
      histrionic, and it must be ultra modern” (103)
        - Her interest in the “emotions, sensations too vivid”.
    - Her libido is wild. Journal from 1908---she is 18---fresh from
      reading Dorian Gray and from three years studying in
      London---one amor after another---boys and girls. She is in
      raptures.
        - “Last night I spent in her arms, and tonight I hate
          her---which being interpreteth meaneth that I adore her,
          that I cannot lie in my bed and not feel the magic of her
          body. Which means that Sex seems as nothing to me. I feel
          more powerfully all those so termed sexual impulses with her
          than I have with any men… gone are my recollections of
          Caesar and Adonis” (99).
    - “Les Deux Etrangeres” --- the two strangers that visit a little
      girl’s room at night. One of them is cloaked and tall, carries a
      sickle, the other one is described as “small and pale” with
      little wings wrapped around it. Also described as “cold” and
      “baby”. The girl rejects Death and accepts the baby, which says
      to her, “I shall creep into your heart and stay there always… I
      am wrapping your heart round with my little wings” (39).
        - This seems foreboding to me---like the little one is a
          sickness which will eventually overtake her. The way she
          describes Death elsewhere as “coming” and “holding her
          close”
    - “I don’t want to find this is real consumption… How unbearable
      it would be to die, leave ‘scraps’, ‘bits’, nothing real
      finished” (125).
        - The intense need to finish her work, to bring it to a
          cohesive whole. But this is unnecessary. We do not need
          wholes in order to receive her intense emotions and
          sensations.
- The effect of the textual editing of the Journals
    - First JMM selected and transcribed a very small volume of her
      “Journal”, with an even smaller portion containing her
      adolescent work. Then he published a “Scrapbook”. Very selective
      and heavy punctuating---adding exclamation, question marks,
      colons and semi-colons.
        - Much of the sexual content edited out by JMM then reinstated
          (quietly) by MS.
        - Fn 88 on page 100 --- indicating that JMM had cut some pages
          from the entry where KM describes her sapphic liason --- “In
          fact, the pages he omitted here are less indecipherable than
          many he tackled and published”. Some lines JMM omitted: “O
          Oscar! Am I peculiarly susceptible to the sexual impulse?”
          (101).

"Bliss"
- Affect --- the strength of the feeling of bliss, which extends from
  the content into the style, which is simplistic, straightforward,
  descriptive. There are moments when the style starts to give in
  pressure of the bliss---ellipses, repetitions---
    - “What was there in the touch of that cool arm that could
      fan--fan--start blazing--blazing--the fire of bliss that Bertha
      did not know what to do with?” (7).
- Emotions/Feelings create Misreadings
    - Her feelings prime her for a serious misreading of reality. She
      reads an intimacy between herself and a woman, that she could
      love her, that they both understand each other wordlessly,
      passing “signs” back and forth. She also intuits that her
      husband does not like this woman. In fact, it is revealed in the
      end, that the woman actually is having an affair with her
      husband, and they are very fond of each other. Bertha’s blissful
      disposition won’t allow her to see this truth. She doesn’t
      really process it in the story, but ends up by just looking at
      the Pear tree blossoms.
        - *Connection to Mirror Neurons and misreading*
** Postmodern Memoir-esque
*** Baldwin, James. *Giovanni's Room*. 1956.
- This book is haunting. From the first few pages, there’s a fatalism
  in David’s voice. You know that the narrator is keeping off
  something terrible, hiding something terrible. You never get a full
  admission from him---that he is a homosexual---but it reads in a
  confessional tone. It is a confession that never names that which is
  being confessed (Sedgwick).
- David’s main issue is his hatred of himself, which he projects onto
  almost all of the others in the novel---Jacques, Guillaume,
  Giovanni, Hella, his father, even Sue. The secret that he hides
  makes him hate all of the others.
    - Describing his relationship with Giovanni in terms of
      violence. There are many moments when he thinks they will come
      to blows.
        - “I dropped my brick and went to him. In a moment I heard his
          fall. And at moments like this I felt that we were merely
          enduring and committing the longer and lesser and more
          perpetual murder” (118).
    - His act of love toward Sue as “despising” the body.
        - “I tried to convey, through this grisly act of love, the
          intelligence, at least, that it was not her, not her flesh,
          that I despised---it would not be her I could not face when
          we became vertical again” (100).
- There is a lot of misogyny directed at women which is a result of
  male/female power relations. What Bersani talks about the violence
  of male/female sex, where one is always taking power over the other.
    - “When my fingers began, involuntarily, to loose their hold on
      Hella, I realized that I was dangling from a high place and that
      I had been clinging to her for my very life” (158).
        - Men rely on subjugating women in order to feel powerful, to
          feel like subjects. Adrienne rich talks about men who will
          need to birth themselves as subjects without having woman do
          the work: she reads in the poetry of men a “deep pessimism
          and fatalistic grief; and I wonder if it isn’t the masculine
          side of what women have experienced, the price of masculine
          dominance. One thing I am sure of: just as woman is becoming
          her own midwife, creating herself anew, so man will have to
          learn to gestate and give birth to his own
          subjectivity---something he has frequently wanted woman to
          do for him” (25.)
    - The rectum being the site of self shattering.
        - “Giovanni’s hands… hands which would have the power to crush
          me and make me whole again” (88).
- What is the implicit moral of the story? The same as in Dorian
  Gray. Only the terms here are more explicit.
    - The conversation between David and Jacques, just when David is
      meeting Giovanni, mirrors the conversation between Lord Henry
      and Dorian Gray, when LH is telling him to embrace his youth and
      beauty while he has it. The difference is that the terms of
      homosexuality are discussed openly.
        - Jacques says “ ‘Love him,’ said Jacques, with vehemence,
          ‘love him and let him love you. Do you think that anything
          else under heaven really matters?... If you think of them as
          dirty, then they will be dirty---they will be dirty because
          you will be despising your flesh and his. But you can make
          your time together anything but dirty; you can give each
          other something which will make both of you
          better---forever---if you will not be ashamed, if you will
          only not play it safe…. You play it safe long enough… and
          you’ll end up trapped in your own dirty body, forever and
          forever and forever---like me.’” (57).

*** Anzaldua, Gloria. *Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza*. 1987.
- Bringing the mystical back into writing and identity.
    - “Faculdad” is being awoken, the faculty of keeping intact our
      shifting and multiple identity, is a dormant areas of
      consciousness now “alien” to us: “La faculdad is the capacity to
      see in surface phenomena the meaning of deeper realities, to see
      the deep structure below the surface. It is an instant
      ‘sensing,’ a quick perception arrived at without conscious
      reasoning” (60).
        - the idea that parts of the self are unconscious.
    - “Sometimes I get sick when I do write. … But, in reconstructing
      the traumas behind the images, I make ‘sense’ out of them, and
      once they have ‘meaning’ they are changed, transformed. It is
      then that writing heals me, brings me great joy... Choose words,
      images, body sensations…  reprogramming my consciousness” (92).
        - Similar to V Woolf's description of illness as generative
          for her writing. The answer is to turn trauma into form.
- Severing the male and the female:
    - The idea is that we are either male or female. But Anzaldua is
      more than dual, she is multiple. There is a magical aspect to
      this “deformity”, which goes back to the spirituality of the
      tribes, the Aztecs, the indians before them.
- Concept of the “borderland” or “frontera” ---
    - The space where touching happens across a difference: “The
      borderlands are physically present whenever two or more cultures
      edge each other, where people of different races occupy the same
      territory, where under, lower, middle, and upper classes touch,
      where the space between two individuals shrinks with intimacy”
      (preface).
    - “Una herida abierta” --- an open wound.
        - Reconceives Sedgwick's *Touching Feeling* but in a negative
          valence.
        - Intersectionality --- oppressed not just by race, but by
          gender and class. Chicanas being forced to choose between
          being a feminist or supporting the family/community.

*** Myles, Eileen. *Chelsea Girls*. 1994.
- I didn’t know this was fiction. When reading it at first I was
  quickly interested then got bored after about fifty pages. I kept on
  and when I eventually found out it was fiction I was immediately
  interested again.
    - If it’s all true, there’s an ennui, there’s boredom, there’s too
      much. All the fuckups. There’s only so much I can read about
      fisting and fighting. But when I read it as fiction, when I’m
      aware of it as a construction, then I’m interested. I want to
      know how it’s made. I want to know what’s being said, to what
      purpose, what’s being held back. I am interested in the problem
      of FORM. and how FORM matters in ordering the story.
- The main theme---the role of FORM in distinguishing fiction from
  nonfiction.
    - “What’s fiction is arrangement---the order of things. If
      somebody is lying to you, part of what they’re doing is hiding
      things, omitting stuff, changing the order of things. And that’s
      fiction” (Paris Review Interview).
    - Myles is arranging her story.
        - Telling us about the way her father died, and how she
          watched him die without doing anything but her “punishment”
          copying out those lines. Her dedication to her craft of
          repeating lines.
        - “You can’t force a story that doesn’t want to be told. It
          was that kind of year” (101) --- her writing about her
          friend Paul’s death, by way of explaining what happened one
          summer, the summer of Woodstock. Discussing her own
          self-destruction, even buying the Boston Globe---
          “Everything I did was something to fix me. With all of my
          heart I was trying to be dead” (101). She has issues with
          her boyfriend, who is normal and she is not. So she ends up
          going to Woodstock with Paul, who’s also a weirdo. They have
          a good time. They part ways when they get back, and the next
          time she sees him is soon after in a casket. He bought a car
          and ran it into a wall.
- My boredom as a reader mirroring her boredom in so many of the
  social situations. She’s bored at bars, she’s bored on dates, she’s
  even bored during sex. So much of life is boring. So much that we do
  not process or do not want to process.

*** Barthes, Roland. *R.B.*. 1975.
- Barthes’ Formalism as a way of subverting unity
    - This takes the form of an alphabetical list of topics of
      interest / problems. For Barthes, structure and schemes are
      important as a foundation for dismantling. He’s looking to
      trouble the idea of unity. This is why he likes fragments. This
      resistance toward overall coherence is very important to him.
        - “The important thing is that these little networks not be
          connected, that they do not slide into a single enormous
          network which would be the structure of the book, its
          meaning” (148).
    - However, his indexical structure makes me want to rearrange it,
      find embedded patterns, perform a deformance, etc. The reader
      will always impose their own meaning on the given structure.
- Barthes’ exclusion from seeing or expressing himself. Barthes claims
  that writing, as well as other artistic media, precludes
  self-expression. Despite the potential of language to excite, give
  pleasure, or even embarrass, the subject remains barred from seeing
  or expressing himself. The queer writer in particular experiences
  this exclusion from expression, not having the language to describe
  his exclusion.
    - “Walking through the Church of Saint-Sulpice and happening to
      witness the end of a wedding, he has a feeling of
      exclusion. Now, why this faltering, produced under the effect of
      the silliest of spectacles: ceremonial, religious, conjugal, and
      petit bourgeois (it was not a large wedding)? Chance had
      produced that rare moment in which the whole symbolic
      accumulates and forces the body to yield. He had received in a
      single gust all the divisions of which he is the object, as if,
      suddenly, it was the very being of exclusion with which he had
      been bludgeoned: dense and hard. For to the simple exclusions
      which this episode represented for him was added a final
      alienation: that of his language: he could not assume his
      distress in the very code of distress, i.e., express it: he felt
      more than excluded: detached: forever assigned the place of the
      witness, whose discourse can only be, of course, subject to
      codes of detachment: either narrative, or explicative, or
      challenging, or ironic: never lyrical, never homogenous with the
      pathos outside of which he must seek his place” (85-86).
        - Walking by the church where a wedding is taking place; he
          feels a double blow, first, that he is alienated (as a
          queer, he will never marry); second that he cannot express
          this alienation in language. The physical experience of the
          blow is one of exclusion, as if exclusion is what is
          bludgeoning him.
- Barthes’ Desire for a Gentler Language
    - The inherent violence of language, the dogging of language after
      truth. As a result, the subject cannot express himself. The
      blockage of subjectivity seems to center on the body---the
      subject wants to see himself, feel himself, etc. But the
      language that he uses in attempt to express himself is too
      assertive.
        - “I should have uttered it as a dreamy speech… unfortunately
          I am condemned to assertion: we lack in French [and perhaps
          in every other language] a grammatical mode which would
          speak lightly [our conditional is much too heavy]” (55).
            - Is there a language that simulates dreams? An ultra
              conditional subjunctive? A mode of gentle speculation?
    - “What is evident is violent, even if this evidence is gently,
      liberally, democratically represented; what is paradoxical what
      does not follow itself, is less so, even if it is imposed
      arbitrarily: a tyrant who promulgated preposterous laws would
      all in all be less violent than the masses which were content to
      utter what is self-evident, what follows of itself: the
      ‘natural’ is, in short, the ultimate outrage” (85).

Bechdel, Alison. *Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama*. 2012.
- The reading experience is overwhelming, disorienting. The way her
  mind works is circular and textile, she weaves through many ideas
  over and over again. She uses images to evoke and explore different
  angles on past threads.
    - The scene of her mother taking dictation on her diary turns from
      one of her mother’s selflessness, to her own editing out parts
      of her day, to her realizing in this practice she was
      constructing a false self that complies with the kind of person
      her mother was and needed her to be. This act of her mother’s
      generosity and care turns into a source of anger, when Alison
      realizes that she couldn’t get what she needed from her mother.
- Genre/Medium of Graphic Memoir.
    - The narrative modes --- word and image --- create a layering of
      stories.
        - For example, in the opening, we have a dream sequence. The
          verbal narration above the panel is speaking in retrospect,
          the narration inside the panel are the thoughts occurring
          during the dream. Then we abruptly cut to another scene,
          Alison is in the car, rehearsing a conversation where she
          tells her mother she is writing a book about her father (Fun
          Home). There is a dialogue that Alison is carrying out with
          herself, playing the part of herself and her mother. There
          is the voiceover narration. These two coincide in strange
          ways, create a layering that charges the images and dialogue
          with additional meaning.
            - “This story begins when I began to tell another story.”
              --- there are many stories up in the air.
            - “The real problem in this memoir about my mother is that
              it has no beginning” (6).
                - Things start to compound, vibrate. The reading
                  experience is very immersive as a result.
- Alison’s decision to be a lesbian is the source of her healing.
    - If she hadn’t been totally determined to live openly, she fears
      that she would have been totally compliant. She would have never
      interrogated her childhood and relationship with her mother, she
      would have perpetuated the cycle. Her decision to write is part
      of her impulse to figure it out, to perform a self-therapy. She
      takes a picture of herself posing in the position when she hung
      up on her mom. The conversation when it became clear to her that
      her mother’s acceptance is not possible, not because of any
      fault of her mother’s, but because of a lack, that she doesn’t
      have what Alison needs from her.
- Is this a memoir? Is this more fiction or autobiography? For Alison,
  it is a memoir, it is her life, but her experience of it. It is not
  “fiction”, not like Eileen Myles understands fiction, anyway.

*** Rosenberg, Jordy. *Confessions of the Fox*. 2018.
- Relatable: Well, to say the least, a profound effect---emotions
  including sadness, fear, joy, sympathy and empathy. I found myself
  in Jack, I found my struggle in Jack’s struggle. I also found myself
  in the Voth, in his histories with women and his understanding of
  women. This is what fiction does, no?
- Missing pages --- the marbled page substitutes speculation for
  recovery which the corporation wants (to monetize the image of
  “abnormal” genitalia). But the narrator didn’t want to include
  it. The absence of the picture doesn’t point to a physical absence,
  but to the inability to articulate exactly what was there according
  to the structures of the time.
    - *This is like Klein's image of absence and Caughie's storm
      cloud, a refusal to engage with positivist impulse, but here
      it's taken to apply to alternative sexual identities. Some
      things, if already absent, are not meant to be “recovered”.
      They can just exist as an absence*.
    - There are stakes in here about archival work and knowledge and
      what can and cannot be said. There is a massive gap in our
      understanding of transbodies and sex and it cannot be
      articulated or understood so it simply comes across as
      absent. The missing page creates an economy of speculation.
    - Relates to the inability of language to inform our
      understanding, because it becomes fixed---Caughie’s Storm
      Cloud. Rather than fix or recover, this give the reader an
      opportunity for imagination.
        - When they are trying to find a term for the way they are
          intimate: “I don’t give language to things that are beyond
          it” (93).
            - Things that are beyond language... Language is a
              limitation, a delimitation. It is a circumscription.
- The levels of narration---the footnotes
    - The footnotes add a very personal and fascinating level to the
      story. I was often more interested in the footnotes than the
      primary storyline. The footnotes enact a desire for more
      information. They are an affective structure for the story. They
      are irresistible, giving more information but also occluding it.
    - The parallel narrative, what I loved the most was the story
      about women and love and the difficulties of achieving
      intimacy. This narrative engages form as a condition of the
      archive in a beautiful way. We have the different levels of
      history, we can see them on the page.

** Specters
*** Schreiner, Olive. *The Story of an African Farm*. 1883.
- The POV is in 3rd person, but there is a kind of hovering in the
  narrative voice. The omniscient narrator is very close to the
  characters, which throws into question "reality". It's in 3rd person
  but it doesn't feel right.
- The main female character is dealing with issues in feminism, living
  in a patriarchal rural society. The main male character is dealing
  with metaphysical issues---the problem of evil, of time passing. It
  puts these concerns on a hierarchy. Even though she is of a higher
  class than him, she doesn't have the luxury to ask the bigger
  questions because her autonomy is in dispute.

*** Rachilde. *Monsieur Venus*. 1884.
- Raoule sees Jacques as an androgynous figure with some feminine
  characteristics which she then amplifies. In one sense, through her
  merciless abuse, she helps him find a more certain gender identity
  for himself. By this same process, Raoule subverts her own gender,
  at one point even being begged by Jacques to just be a man. At the
  conclusion of the novel, Raoule appears to have no single gender,
  sometimes appearing as woman and other times as a man.
- Raoule does not feminize Jacques because she is attracted to
  women. She has no interest in Marie and she denies being a lesbian
  to de Raittolbe. She feminizes Jacques because she is using
  sexuality as an escape from ennui and a tool for her identity. In
  the name of those causes, she explores and takes pleasure in
  cross-dressing, humiliation, sadomasochism, and something that falls
  somewhere between Pygmalionism and necrophilia.

*** James, Henry. "The Beast in the Jungle," 1886 & "The Figure in the Carpet," 1896.
- James is known for being a repressed homosexual, and for being read
  for traces same sex desire. But I did not have this experience with
  him at all. I had a terrible feeling reading Beast in the Jungle, as
  an undergrad, without knowing why (I was still dating men). I was
  also afraid that something great and awful would happen to me. With
  the Figure in the Carpet, in my first year of grad school, I didn't
  even realize that the secret was about homosexuality (I was not even
  close to being fully out) until I went to class and everybody seemed
  aware and agreed on that point.
