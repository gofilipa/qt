** Hardware
*** Macintosh IIci
**** Overview
1989-1993

**** usage
Monitor switch on the back, power switch on the keyboard. Monitor
turns on but computer does not boot up. Turns out it was the power was
not hooked up. When fixed, it booted.

It runs Cyborg well, which is saved on the desktop. But it does not
run the other games saved on the desktop: We Descend and Patchwork
Girl. Nor does it load from their floppies. Patchwork Girl opens and
closes, and We Descend is not recognized by the OS. The OS not
recognize the Marble Springs floppy as well. With Patchwork Girl,
could be in part because the software lisence only allows itself to be
installed on one computer.


*** Amiga 1000
**** Overview
1985-1996
**** usage
Difficult to use. Had to use two disks (Kickstart and Workbench) to
get it going. Different programs are on different disks. Cannot figure
out how to close some windows, but the idea of drawers is
interesting. 

Used TextCraft Plus for some word processing. Was interesting looking,
not many features, but had measured margins. The text wrapping went
off the screen before returning to the next line. Strange.

Need to learn more about how the drawers/screens work and how to use
multiple programs when you just have one drive. For example, when I
put in TextCraft, it asked me for Workbench. 

*** Macintosh SE
**** Overview
1987-1989
Excellent video on the SE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1S2j3TF4bI

**** usage
Marble Springs v.1 is saved here.

I read some of the text and added my own text to the Kenji file, about
his wife who was secretly inspired by the lesbians in Marble Springs
to go off and find her own lover, back in Japan, a princess by the
name of Mononoke. 

I also created some new Storyspace cards within a file called "moon to
Deena". 

*** Apple IIc
**** Overview

1983-1993

There is no hard disk. 

Pressing Control + Reset will launch Basic. ] is the prompt. 

You type your programs into the command line. Programs are saved in
RAM as "list", and you can save them later to the disk. 

   ]List
   ]10 let k=99
   ]15 k = k + 1
   ]20 print k

Screen is Raster graphics, using a Cathode Ray Tube.  

**** usage
Monitor is unresposive. Hear computer whirring and clicking, it
recognizes something is inside the drive, but no response.

*** TRS-80 Model 100
**** Overview

*** Kaypro IV
**** Overview
**** Usage
On startup, the texxt on the screen is a bit shakey. 

Enter "dir" to see the commands. Do not think this worked, but it
returned a list of what appears to be files on the disk ("Wordstar")
which included my name.

Typed in command "WS" to open wordstar, and "D" to open
filename. Again, I see my file from so many years ago, and I edit
it. I also edit the file MITH.

I save and close the file.

** Introductino to Apple II and Programming
Apple II came out the same year as the Commodore PET (?) and TRS 80
Tandy. The Apple ][e 1983-4, one of the most produced computers along
with the commodore 64, but the Apple is unique in that it's
extensible. 

Can plug into any monitor with composite input. The yellow
cable/port. 

Apple IIe is better to learn about hardware, and the IIc is better to
learn about software. A IIe with just the CPU is about 100 or less. 

Encoding the bits to pixels is no longer linear, like with Atari or
Commodore. This creates a lot of confusion and struggles with drawing
graphics on the II. 

Call -151 takes you to the disassembler (the "monitor"?) which allows
you to look at the 6502 code.
