This chapter looks at the materiality of digital media by harnessing
concepts of the flesh as developed in black feminsist studies. 
</p>

<p>
First I consider how the flesh has been theorized in black feminist
studies, looking primarily at Snorton and Musser. The concept of the
pornotrope, which is the reduction of body to flesh, offers an
analytic for understanding the kind of capacious thinking required
when two registers combine&#x2014;the physical/analog and the
immaterial/digital. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout this converstaition, I incorporate a discussion of Octavia
Butler's <i>Dawn</i> novel as a way of reading the way that
flesh/physicality engages with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Then, I examine the emergence of hypertext fiction, a subset of
electronic literature, across levels of hardware and software. In
particular, I examine a digital series by Entropy8Zuper! entitled
<i>skinonskinonskin</i> (1999) and its efforts at preservation.

In the nearly impossible task of accounting of the egregious yet
overlooked of horrors of transatlantic slavery, black feminist
thinkers flip a concept that has been used to for the evils of
subjectification&#x2013;the flesh. The idea of black flesh is a reduction of
the black body is first theorized by Hortense Spillers in her
influential essay, "Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe: An American Grammar
Book." Here Spillers puts forth the conception of the black body as a
stack of "attentuated meanings, made in excess over time, assigned by
a particular historical order" (65). These meanings developed from the
body that had been reduced to flesh, a violent process, "severing of
the captive body from its motive will," that Spillers traces to the
middle passage and has four effects (67):
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the captive body becomes the source of an irresistible, destructive
sensuality;</li>
<li>at the same time- in stunning contradiction - the captive body
reduces to a thing, becoming being for the captor;</li>
<li>in this absence from a subject position, the captured sexualities
provide a physical and biological expression of "otherness";</li>
<li>as a category of "otherness," the captive body translates into a
potential for pornotroping and embodies sheer physical
powerlessness that slides into a more general "powerlessness,"
resonating through various centers of human and social meaning. 67</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Imposed by the reduction of bodies to bare physicality, to a material
substance, there is, in "stunning contradiction," some form
of meaning aheres to the flesh, a potential combination of sensuality,
objectificaiton, otherness, and powerlessness (Spillers 67).
</p>

<p>
Snorton suggests that this stripping (and imposition) of meaning
creates a possibility for resignifying black flesh, which "await[s]
whatever marvels of&#x2026; inventiveness" (Spillers 65). More recently,
black feminist theorists such as C. Riley Snorton, Amber Musser, and
Jayna Brown, for example, looks at the denigration of black flesh as a
simultaneous enabling of blackness as power. Snorton, for example,
demonstrates that the whittling down of black subjects to the
interchangeable, what he calls the "fungible," in chattel slavery
creates a possibility for for "fugitivity," or escape. His theorizing
uses the properties of flesh to trace the contradictions that produce
race and gender, for "Captive and divided flesh functions as malleable
matter for mediating and remaking sex and gender as matters of human
categorization and personal definition" (20). To demonstrate the
imbrication between sex, race, and black flesh, Snorton examines how
the denial of femininity of black slaves, whose bodies were used for
experimental purposes, enabled the emergence of field of gynecology as
a <i>white</i> women's science. Snorton explains that, white femininity,
which prevents the inspection of white female genitalia, is
constructed out of the "scopic availability" of black flesh of women
(33). Yet, Snorton crucially asserts, this genderless flesh is also a
"capacitating structure" which enables "fungibility for fugitive
movement" (53). Here, Snorton interweaves various narratives of
fugitivity, such as that of Harriet Jacobs, who escaped slavery in
1842 and subsequently wrote <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>
(1861). Snorton points out that, while traditional racial "passing"
assumes white passing, it is blackness which gives one the "gender
indefiniteness" to enable "cross-gendered modes of escape" (56). The
"blackening" of Jacobs, for example, allowed her to obtain a level of
"fungibility, thingness" that precluded her recognition (Snorton 71).
</p>

<p>
For this "black and trans historiographical project," Snorton
demonstrates flesh as the physical and malleable material that enables
the construction of social categories like race and gender. Snorton's
method takes the details of the archival record as "conditions of
possibility" in his study, and reads for hints of resistance contained
within the dominant narrative that suggest the ommitted, obscured, or
elided experience of black subjects (Snorton 11). One example concerns
a slave woman, Anarcha, whose severe case of Vaginal Fistula made her
an object of medical experimentation. Because the record that hardly
mentions her by name (when it does not misname her) is silent about
her experience of what certainly were painful and prolonged surgeries
without anesthetics, Snorton turns to seemingly minor details like
smell and the presence of other enslaved women to "further imaginative
capacities" for reading resistance (14). Anarcha's reportedly
offensive smell, what Snorton calls the "discourse of disgust," for
example, indexes both her subjection to social hierarchy and her
resistance, for "the recurrent descriptors of Anarcha's body odor
provides an opening to imagine what modicums of protection might have
been afforded by smelling noxious to one's enslaver"
(27). Additionally, the banal reality of servitude implies that other
slave women such as Lucy and Betsey (among others who were unnamed),
stood as medical assitants when necessary, which opens speculation
into "modes of nourishment and care" they provided one another
(Snorton 29); In one procedure on Betsey, for example, Snorton
explains that "the opacity in the archive&#x2026; leaves room to imagine
how Betsey might have somehow resisted the performance of stoic
bravery or willing subjectivity that she was compelled to produce"
(25).
</p>

<p>
This methodology uses the critical imagination to read into what
Saidiya Hartman and others call "the violence of the archive," a
violence not only in the form of evidence, that the records literally
obscure or overlook information, but also in the tools of expression,
in the language that cannot approximate experience, and in the
discourse that dictates silence (2). Like "Critical fabulation,"
Snorton's reading of archival material draws narrative from the gaps
and lacunae of the evidence, working to "expose and exploit the
incommensurability between the experience of the enslaved and the
fictions of history" (Hartman 10). One difference however, which is
crucial for my purpose, is the influence of <i>flesh</i> following Spillers
as the "zero degree of social conceptualization" (Spillers
67). Snorton's attention to flesh as a <i>ground</i> for theorizing enables
him to attend to the implications of format and form in the
archive. For example, Snorton explains that the materiality of a
daguerreotype suggests "a visual grammar for reading the imbrications
of 'race' and 'gender' under captivity" (40):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To view a daguerreotype is to look at an image that does not sit on a
surface but appears to be floating in space. Rather than an antiquated
form of modern photography, as Foucault’s characterization implies,
the daguerreotype provides a series of lessons about power, and racial
power in particular, as a form in which an image takes on myriad
perspectives because of the interplay of light and dark, both in the
composition of the shot and in the play of light on the display. That
the image does not reside on the surface but floats in an unmappable
elsewhere offers an allegory for race as a procedure that exceeds the
logics of a bodily surface, occuring by way of flesh, a racial
mattering that appears through puncture in the form of a wound or
covered by skin and screened from view. 40
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The format of the dagguereotype evokes the method by which meaning is
stripped then reapplied to flesh that, for captive bodies, "functioned
as a disarticulation of human form from its anatomical features"
(18). The physical material of the image, that is the silvered copper
plate of the daguerreotype, at once solidifies its ground and indexes
an ambiguous space, what Snorton describes as the "unmappable
elsewhere" which swells to obscure while containing the evidence of
racial significations. Snorton's curious use of the word "puncture"
here recalls Roland Barthes's concept of the "punctum," which indexes
the experience of being pierced by a detail of the photograph (<i>Camera
Lucida</i> 27). Opposed to the concept of the <i>studium</i>, which represents
the dominant historical, social, or cultural meaning portrayed within
and by the photograph, the <i>punctum</i> is the "sting, speck, cut, little
hole&#x2026; that accident which pricks me (but also buises me, is poignant
to me)" (Barthes <i>Camera Lucida</i> 27-28). Barthes explains that,
"However lightning-like it may be, the <i>punctum</i> has, more or less
potentially, the power of expansion. This power is often metonymic"
(<i>Camera Lucida</i> 45). For Barthes, the <i>punctum</i> is that detail of a
photograph which at once pierces the viewer and suggests an expansion,
an effect which is exagerrated in erotic photographs, where the
<i>punctum</i>, "is a kind of subtle <i>beyond</i>&#x2013;as if the image launched
desire beyond what it permits us to see" (59). Barthes's theorization
of the <i>punctum</i> allows us to see how the flesh can be at once a
<i>mattering</i>, a becoming matter, and an accumulation of meaning which
peirces the viewer. The meeting between this liminal space of the
image's meanings and its silver-plated copper ground offers a means
for thinking through the collision of two registers, of flesh against
gender &amp; race.
</p>

<p>
Amber Jamilla Musser runs with the notion of unmappability to theorize
surface aesthetics in her conception of <i>brown jouissance</i>. Like
Snorton, Musser develops her ideas alongside a reading of photograph
technology, in this case, from a photograph of the artist Lyle
Harris's "citation" of Billie Holiday. Musser's reading of the
photograph theorizes the way that escapability emerges from the
superfical, the surface of this image, in its "shine" revealing a self
that is excessive yet inaccessible. Musser notes the details of
Harris's dress, such as the "pearls, eye shadow and lipstick" that
capture the light of the image, as the "Shine [which] plays joyfully
with the idea of the body as body while rejecting the demand to
present anything other than surface" ("Surface-Becoming"
par. 3). Moving beyond the unmappable elsewhere, surface for Musser
not only indexes but <i>forecloses</i> access to that which we cannot know:
She explains, "we can understand surface as the underside of the
scientific/pornographic drive toward locating knowledge in an
'objective' image" ("Surface-Becoming" par. 2). The material of the
surface, which "highlights the mutability of the flesh rather than
interiority," suggests that which escapes its own form (Musser,
"Surface-Becoming" par. 11). While foreclosing the reading of
interiority, the surface aesthetics opens up other considerations,
such as the evocation of hunger in Lyle's open mouth: "sticking with
the surface&#x2013;–through the use of Polaroid and shine–&#x2013;illuminates the
possibilities of imaging a self whose interiority we do not have
plumb, but who still generates creative possibilities for resisting
the mandate of sovereign subjectivity" ("Surface-Becoming"
par. 23). To locate in something physical that which eludes
physicality is a way of resisting (without attempting to recuperate)
the reduction of body to flesh.
