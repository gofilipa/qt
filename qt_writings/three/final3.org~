"Sex, Flesh, Skin: A Media Archaeology of Octavia Butler's /Dawn/ and
Entropy8Zuper!'s /skinonskinonskin/"

** chapter overview
This paper juxtaposes two unlikely texts--an early hypertext work from
1999, and a science fiction novel from 1987--to unpack the role of
“media” across physiological and technological systems. The early
hypertext work, /skinonskinonskin/, written collectively by the
artist-couple known as Entropy8Zuper!, explores
electronically-mediated desire through a series of digital love poems
that combine hypertext, audio, and Flash media technology. The fiction
novel, Dawn by Octavia Butler, poses a post-apocalyptic scenario where
humans find themselves coerced into sex and procreation with
extraterrestrial colonizers. In these couplings, sexual contact is
routed through an alien intermediary who plugs directly into the human
brain's pleasure centers. Though Butler’s novel and /skinonskinonskin/
present vastly different narrative worlds and physical formats, I’m
interested in how both texts trouble the boundary between materiality
and abstraction, in one case technological, through computer hardware
and software, and in another physiological, through nervous systems
and brain chemistry.

In Butler’s novel, I examine how human flesh--the traditional site for
sexual contact between two partners--is bypassed for direct neural
stimulation facilitated by an alien intermediary. By bypassing the
flesh, this method of intercourse dissolves the distinction between
self and other--the root of xenophobia--as well as sense and
thought. Drawing from thinkers in Chicanx Studies and Black Feminist
Studies, I argue that this method creates an ethics based on pleasure
rather than choice or consent.

Turning to /skinonskinonskin/, I trace the complicated stack of
technologies, including web tools and Flash media, that facilitate the
display and preservation of this work. Borrowing from Media
Archaeology, I analyze how the work's various "screen effects" engages
with its underlying software logics. My overall goal is to explore the
material qualities of media--be they technical or physiological--for
the ways they offers a kind of capacious mode for theorizing new,
queer forms of communication and ethical relations.

** sex
*** section overview
These sections examine human vs Oankali social structures to read the
priortization of sensuality and feeling as a basis for more ethical
relationships. While humans work within hierarchical social systems,
the Oankali use thier physiological capacities to achieve
collectivity. These physiological capacities, which includes creating
direct, neural connections between separate brains, blend cognitive
processes with physical ones, creating a collision of registers. This
collision points to the role of sensuality, particularly the flesh, in
mediating communication and facilitating ethical modes of relation. 

*** fear
In the novel /Dawn/, the first of the /Xenogenesis/ trilogy by Octavia
Butler, the main character, Lilith Iyapo, is seduced by an alien. The
alien, called "Nikanj," is an ooloi, or third- or neutral-gendered
being. Nikanj coaxes Lilith to join it and her human partner, Joseph:
"'Lie here with us,' it says, 'Why should you be down there by
yourself?,'" an invitation which Lilith cannot resist:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
She thought there could be nothing more seductive than an ooloi
speaking in that particular tone, making that particular
suggestion. She realized she had stood up without meaning to and taken
a step toward the bed. She stopped, stared at the two of
them. Joseph’s breathing now became a gentle snore and he seemed to
sleep comfortably against Nikanj as she had awakened to find him
sleeping comfortably against her many times. She did not pretend
outwardly or to herself that she would resist Nikanj’s invitation—-or
that she wanted to resist it. Nikanj could give her an intimacy with
Joseph that was beyond ordinary human experience. And what it gave, it
also experienced. 306
#+END_QUOTE
The erotic desire that Lilith experiences is intense enough to make
her temporarily ignore that these aliens, called "Oankali," have
descended upon earth with one goal: to coerce humans to reproduce with
them and create a human-alien species. As ooloi, Nikanj has a special
sexual organ that facilitates a neural connection between a male and
female partner, in this case, between Lilith and Joseph. It makes this
connection by inserting this organ, a "sensory hand," into each
partner's spinal cord, located at the back of the neck. During the sex
act, this organ stimulates each partner's pleasure centers in the
brain and collects genetic information which the Oankali will
eventually suse to engineer a human-alien embryo.

Despite her eagerness to have sex with Nikanj, Lilith harbors a deep
resistance against the Oankali's intention to procreate with
humanity. Scenes like the one above, in which Lilith surrenders to her
sexual desire, appear in stark contrast to her determination to
escape, conveyed by her invocation to "Learn and run!" which she
repeats up until the last page of the novel. Having barely survived a
nuclear apocalypse only to be "rescued" by the aliens, Lilith, along
with the surviving humans, is being held on the Oankali spaceship in
preparation to do their part in the "gene trade"--that is, to
re-populate the earth with a new human-Oankali species. The Oankali
have given Lilith a special job to be a guide, what she calls a "Judas
goat," to shepherd humans into accepting that humanity will change
forever, that their children will look like "Medusa children" (Butler
87).

The conflict between various biological drives, such as sex drive
versus the survival drive, speaks to a larger debate among the novel's
critics about the primacy of biological impulses in determining human
behavior. For, even when this sex act appears contained to the mind,
it is always portrayed as something guided by impulses and tendencies
of the body. Donna Haraway and Kitty Dunkley, for example, argue that
the interspecies couplings challenge naturalizing assumptions about
sex, race, and the human/animal divide. Haraway's influential analysis
from /Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern
Science/ (1989), reads this story "as if it were a report from the
primate field in the allotopic space of earth after a nuclear
holocaust" (376). She argues that the inter-species relations
"facilitate revisionings" of "difference, reproduction, and survival"
(Haraway 377). On the other hand, critics like Stephen Barnes, Nancy
Jesser, and Erin Ackerman argue for a biological determinist
reading. Stephen Barnes, who knew Butler personally, emphasizes the
influence of biological research in her writing on human nature,
sharing that Butler was fascinated by what she called "emergent
properties," which begin from small impulses, like the tendency to
categorize something as either similar or different, as the seeds of
complex social behaviors and structures. Nancy Jesser emphasizes the
determinist perspective on sex, arguing that "the plot relentlessly
reinforces certain sociobiological notions of essential and 'natural'
male and female through the concept of biological 'tendency'" (Jesser
41-42).

Critics from both sides of the debate agree on one point, however:
that sexuality in the text reflects a firmly heterosexual paradigm.
These views are due to the gendered structure of the sex act, which
maintains a male/female coupling, despite the addition of an ooloi
participant. Haraway, for example, asserts that, "Heterosexuality
remains unquestioned, if more complexly mediated. The different social
subjects, the different genders that could emerge from another
embodiment of resistance to compulsory heterosexual reproductive
politics, do not inhabit this /Dawn/" (380). According to this view
Butler's deconstruction of species and sex falls short of affecting
sexuality.

This chapter argues that the heterosexual paradigm is indeed
disrupted, and it is disrupted by a queer mode of relation which
emerges in the tripartite sexual union enabled by the ooloi figure.
In what follows, I will examine the connection created by this union,
whose linkage of neural pathways between two bodies scrambles the
distinctions between thinking and feeling, a clash of registers that
blends the materiality of the flesh with the abstraction of cognitive
processes.

This chapter will explore how this clash of registers operates across
two seemingly unrelated domains: Black Feminist Studies and Media
Archaeology Studies. I will examine how each of these domains
theorizes the intersection of physical embodiment with chemical,
conceptual, and/or electrical signaling, reading for sensuality across
medial environments. Finally, I will put these ideas into practice
with a close reading of a work of electronic fiction,
/skinonskinonskin/. My goal is to explore the material qualities of
media--be they technical or physiological--for the ways they offer a
kind of capacious mode for theorizing new, queer forms of
communication and ethical relations.

To begin this exploration, I first examine a moment of heightened
sensuality from the story, a moment of extreme fear. This moment
occurs when Lilith comes face-to-face with her captors for the first
time. Jhadaya, a male Oankali, meets Lilith in her isolation room. She
initially processes his alien body according to human anatomical terms:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The lights brightened as she had supposed they would, and what had
seemed to be a tall, slender man was still humanoid, but it had no
nose--no bulge, no nostrils--just flat, gray skin. It was gray all
over--pale gray skin, darker gray hair on its head that grew down
around its eyes and ears and at its throat. There was so much hair
across the eyes that she wondered how the creature could see. The
long, profuse ear hair seemed to grow out of the ears as well as
around them. Above, it joined the eye hair, and below and behind, it
joined the head hair. The island of throat hair seemed to move
slightly, and it occurred to her that that might be where the creature
breathed--a kind of natural tracheostomy.

Lilith glanced at the humanoid body, wondering how humanlike it really
was. "I don't mean any offense," she said, "but are you male or
female?"

"It's wrong to assume that I must be a sex you're familiar with," it
said, "but as it happens, I'm male."

Good. It could become 'he' again. Less awkward. 29
#+END_QUOTE
Although Jdhaya points out Lilith's mistake for assuming hisq gender,
she nonetheless takes some comfort from being able to call him a "he."
The gender designation, along with a catalogue of mammalian anatomical
features "hair," "eyes," "ears," and "throat," reveals the impulse to
categorize the unknown according to human terms. This small comfort,
however, evaporates when the strangeness of the alien's appearance
exceeds the categories available to her:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
She did not want to be any closer to him. She had not known what held
her back before. Now she was certain it was his alienness, his
difference, his literal unearthliness. She found herself still unable
to take even one more step toward him.

"Oh god," she whispered. And the hair--the whatever it
was--moved. Some of it seemed to blow toward her as though in a wind,
though there was no stirring of air in the room.

She frowned, strained to see, to understand. Then, abruptly, she did
understand. She backed away, scrambled around the bed and to the far
wall. When she could go no farther, she stood against the wall,
staring at him.

Medusa. 30
#+END_QUOTE 
As Lilith attempts to place the alien into familiar categories, she
undergoes a complex physio-cognitive process. First, she uses
anatomical categories to perceive Jhadaya. Then, as his difference
begins to register, she apprehends him on a pre-linguistic, embodied
level, characterized by paralyzing aversion where she is "unable to
take even one more step toward him" (29-30). Then, when Lilith
examines his face more closely, the interval of immobilizing fear ends
abruptly with her "understand[ing]." She expresses her aversion in
figurative language, evocing the mythical figure "Medusa."

The choice of "Medusa" here is significant. It demonstrates that
Lilith subscribes the unknown in terms of something familiar to the
human imaginary, ableit in the context of myth. Her physio-cognitive
progression from instinctual body movement to intellection suggests a
peculiar wasy that humanity handles the unknown. This can be
attributed to a particular combination of human traits, which the
Oankali call the "human contradiction." Later in this scene, Jhadaya
describes these two traits:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"You are intelligent," he said. "That's the newer of the two
characteristics, and the one you might have put to work to save
yourselves. You are potentially one of the most intelligent species
we've found, though your focus is different from ours. Still, you had
a good start in the life sciences, and even in genetics."

"What's the second characteristic?  

"You are hierarchical. That's the older and more entrenched
characteristic. We saw it in your closest animal relatives and in your
most distant ones. It's a terrestrial characteristic. When human
intelligence served it instead of guiding it, when human intelligence
did not even acknowledge it as a problem, but took pride in it or did
not notice it at all..." [...] "That was like ignoring cancer. I
think your people did not realize what a dangerous thing they were
doing."
#+END_QUOTE
According to Jhadaya, the tendency toward hierarchy, to create social
groupings, even to colonize and oppress, descends from an ancient
instinct that once served to sustain, protect, and organize early
human tribes. But when the hierarchical instinct grows unchecked into
the modern world, Jdhaya explains, it creates unjust divisions within
society. 

For Lilith, then, the tendency toward hierarchy first demands that she
place this being on a scale of familiarity. She compares Jhadaya to
what she already knows about other living beings, placing him into a
binary gender system, for example. However, when the hierarchy fails
to subsume his other qualities, like the strange, moving "hair"
growing all over his body, her intelligence steps in to speculate with
an analogy, "Medusa." Here, her mind makes the leap between what she
sees and what she can imagine. The analogy to the Medusa indicates
that this particular type of xenophobia is not just of otherness, but
in the interplay between otherness and similarity. What scares Lilith
is an apparent familiarity of this humanoid, this bipedal, two-limbed
creature, which has an audible language and conscious intelligence is
combined aspects that do not belong to any mammal. "Medusa" marks the
moment when Lilith, who until then has been struggling to place a
strange being within known phenomena, finally settles onto a familiar
designation. Despite his alienness, at that point, Jhadaya becomes
incorporated into an anthropocentric worldview--specifically, into a
fearsome figure that represents monstrous and deadly femininity.

Criticism on the novel does a good job of situating the tension
between similarity and difference within intersectional
feminism.[fn:2] Here, however, I am interested in this experience of
difference and similarity-in-difference as a physiological response,
and what it can reveal about ethical relations. Here, I draw from
Chicana feminist theorists Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa who
write about the expereince of xenophobia from a sensual
dimension. Moraga, for example, argues that the fear of the other is
heightened by a perceived similarity between the self and
other. Speaking about social hierarchies of oppression, Moraga asserts
that, "it is not really difference the oppressor fears so much as
similarity" (32). However, at the same time that perceived similarity
causes fear, it also offers an opportunity for connection. Moraga, for
example, draws from her sexuality to relate to her mother, who
experienced levels of poverty and colorism that Moraga, as an educated
"guera," was able to avoid:
#+begin_quote
It wasn't until I acknowledged and confronted my own lesbianism in the
flesh that my heartfelt identification with and empathy for my
mother's oppression--due to being poor, uneducated, and Chicana--was
realized. My lesbianism is the avenue through which I have learned the
most about silence and oppression, and it continues to be the most
tactile reminder to me that we are not free human beings. 28-29
#+end_quote
When difference is a source of "silence and oppression," as it has
been for Moraga's sexuality, finding similarity requires a deeply
sensual process. Here, Moraga's sexuality enables her to make a
connection to other kinds of difference, specifically differences
across skin tone and economic class. This confrontation occurs "in the
flesh," meaning that difference is a felt, sensational phenomenon, a
"tactile reminder" that bridges the gap between self and other.

Anzaldúa, a Chicana lesbian like Moraga, explores a method for
incorporating difference into identity. Anzaldúa grew up on the
Texas-Mexico border, works to integrate her Aztec, Spanish, and
Mexican backgrounds into a modern Chicana identity. Anzaldúa explains
that surfacing this history and heritage will require "developing a
tolerance for contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity... learn[ing]
to be an Indian [sic] in Mexican culture, to be a Mexican from an
Anglo point of view" (Anzaldua 78-79). Anzaldúa resurrects latent
aspects of the cultural psyche in the form of the fearsome Aztec
goddess, Coatlicue. Like Medusa, Coatlicue is associated with snakes,
her name translates from Nahuatl into "serpent skirt." As the "Earth
Mother who conceives all celestial beings out of her cavernous womb,"
Coatlicue embodies a unity of opposites, the dual forces of life and
death, fertility and destruction (Anzaldua 46). Over time, however,
Anzaldúa explains that this unity has been severed into "pure" and
"impure" aspects. Influenced by a growing patriarchy, Aztec culture
splits Coatlicue into the fertility earth goddess, "Tonantsi," the
puta and into "Coatlalopeuh," the chaste (27). Then, with the arrival
of the Spaniards, the figures are split again, this time into the
Virgin of Guadalupe, the most revered figure of Mexican Cathololicism,
with the negative aspects incorporated into the figures La LLorona and
La Chingada.

/Coatlicue/ incorporates the originary whole that Anzaldúa aims to
bring into a modern imaginary: "Coatlicue- Cihuacoatl- Tlazolteotl-
Tonantzin- Coatlalopeuh- Guadalupe--they are one" (50). The process by
which Anzaldua accesses and integrates the scattered aspects of
Coatlicue is called the "/Coatlicue/ state." Here, Anzaldua enters
into a trance, a spiritual opening, to confront the pain, shame, and
lonelienss of a severed identity. She explains that, "We need
/Coatlicue/ to slow us up so that the psyche can assimilate previous
experiences and process the changes" (Anzaldua 46). Anzaldua describes
the visual confrontation with /Coatlicue/:
#+begin_quote
Seeing and being seen. Subject and object, I and she. The eye pins
down the object of its gaze, scrutinizes it, judges it. A glance can
freeze us in place; it can "possess" us. It can erect a barrier
against the world. But in a glance also lies awareness,
knowledge. These seemingly contradictory aspects--the act of being
seen, held immobilized by a glance, and "seeing through" an
experience--are symbolized by the underground aspects of /Coatlicue/,
/Cihuacoatl/, /Tlazolteotl/ which cluster in what I call the
/Coatlicue/ state. 42
#+end_quote
Here, vision is simultaneously a tool for capture, for being "pin[ned]
down" or "immobilized," and a tool of enlightenment, in "awareness,
knowledge." Anzaldua embraces the duality of this kind of vision, and
in what seems to be its paradoxical effect, which is freedom in
possession. Being the object of /Coatlicue/'s gaze both reliquishes
agency and opens a connection, enabling an intimate relation to the
other.

*** pleasure
Oankali, unlike humans, are attracted to difference. As Jhadaya
explains to Lilith: "We acquire new life, seek it, investigate it,
manipulate it, sort it, use it. We carry the drive to do this in a
minuscule cell within a cell, a tiny organelle within every cell of
our bodies" (84). This essential drive, which powers their "gene
trade," is made possible by that which the humans find most disturbing
about their captors--the tentacle-like organs that sprout from their
bodies. These organs transmit all external sensory information such as
sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, provide channels for the
immediate sharing of thoughts and feelings in intra-Oankali
communication, and faciliate sex. This sensory capacity puts them into
direct contact with those who are different. As a result, the Oankali
do not fear difference, rather, they crave it. This craving to absorb
difference and incorporate it into new life forms is encoded in their
genetic ancestry. Nikanj, the ooloi child who will eventually become
Lilith's mate, explains to Lilith that "'Six divisions ago, on a
white-sun water world, we lived in great shallow oceans'[...] 'We were
many-bodied and spoke with body lights and color patterns among
ourself and among ourselves" (123). From this ancestry, the current
Oankali inheirited a drive for collectivity.

This tendency for collective consciousness, distributed among the
beings, singular and plural at once, "ourself and ourselves,"
destabilize the an assumption underpinning free will, that of
consent. When Nikanj is an adult, Joseph's genetic material to
impregnate Lilith without her knowledge, much less her consent. It
explains to Lilith that it only gives her what she truly wants, which
is a child, "'You'll have a daughter,' it said. 'And you are ready to
be her mother. You could never have said so. Just as Joseph could
never have invited me into his bed'" (468-9). For the Oankali
cultivating life is the principal factor for decision-making. 

The sex scenes in particular portray a level of sensual pleasure and
connection that makes it difficult to separate concious will from
embodied desire. As Jayna Brown points out, "the pleasurable
experience of sex with the Ooloi is so highly compelling it is
sometimes likened to rape in the text" (105). Not only are humans
seduced into sexual relations by the pheramones that arouse an
overwhelming sexual desire, there is involuntary sterilization,
complicity in human-on-human rape, and more seriously, Nikanj's rape
of Joseph. Joshua Yu Burnett explains that while "the novel's
treatment of the issue [of consent] is both provocative and
troubling," "none of this is meant to suggest that the Oankali are
vicious, brutal rapists" (110, 117). Because their sensory and
communication capacities prevent the Oankali from deception, "they
seem quite genuine in their insistance that human claims of
non-consent belie a deeper, physio-psychological consent" (Burnett
117). Justin Louis Mann's "pessimistic futurist" reading of the novel
points the ways that subjugation and coercion partly revises the human
contradiction.[fn:3] Mann explains that the sexual relationship
between Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj is crystalized in the image of
Nikanj's "sensory arm" wrapped around Lilith's neck, which she
describes as "an oddly comfortable noose" (Mann 62). Mann points out
that this noose, while drawing from history of subjugation and death,
also evokes comfort, a kind of complacency with the highly pleasurable
sexual experiences which Lilith enjoys with Nikanj. According to Mann,
this complacency replaces the oppression of the human contradiction
with coersion into physical pleasure (Mann 62).

When Nikanj presents himself to Lilith, one might expect a split
between her sexual desire and her determination to rebel against the
forced interbreeding. But instead, one instead encounters their
conflation, where Lilith welcomes her body's immediate, unconscious
response to Nikanj's invitation. The conflation between embodied
instinct and free will suggests a more fundamental collapse between
physical sensation and mental experience. During the sex act, Lilith
experiences a torrent feelings that leads her to question the
objective reality of her experience. When Nikanj "plugs" into her and
Joseph, she,
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
[I]mmediately recieved Joseph as a blanket of warmth and security, a
compelling, steadying presence.

She never knew whether she was receiving Nikanj's approximation of
Joseph, a true transmission of what Joseph was feeling, some
combination of truth and approximation, or just a pleasant fiction. 

What was Joseph feeling from her?

It seemed to her that she had always been with him. She had no
sensation of shifting gears, no "time alone" to contrast with the
present "time together." He had always been there, part of her,
essential. 308-309
#+END_QUOTE
What Lilith first feels as a physical presence, a "blanket of warmth"
she builds into cognitive interpretation. When she begins to question
the objective truth of her experience, whether Joseph shares in the
same sensations, her doubt soon fades to reassurance. Physical
presence transforms into a mental certainty: "he had always been
there, part of her, essential."

Meanwhile, Nikanj, who is mediating the experience, becomes
imperceptible to the two of them:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Nikanj focused on the intensity of their attraction, their union. It
left Lilith no other sensation. It seemed, itself, to vanish. She
sensed only Joseph, felt that he was aware only of her. 

Now their delight in one another ignited and burned. They moved
together, sustaining an impossible intensity, both of them tireless,
perfectly matched, ablaze in sensation, lost in one another. 308-309
#+END_QUOTE
Their sex dissolves the sense of time, space, and the distance between
Lilith and Joseph, who she felt "was aware only of her." In the midst
of this intensity, the intermediary which makes this fusion possible
fades, leaving Lilith and Jospeh "lost in own another." Afterward,
when Lilith asks if the sex is simulated, Nikanj explains that
although sensory experience is shared between herself and Joseph,
"Intellectually, he made his interpretations and you made yours." To
this, Lilith remarks that she "wouldn't call them intellectual"
(310-311). That Lilith questions whether her mental experiences are
true or not, at the same time that she indicates their sensual nature,
suggests the deep imbrication of the sensual and cognitive registers
during the sex act. The direct neural connection creates a channel
through which embodied sensation and intellectual interpretation can
traffic.

In human-alien sex, thed fusion between minds surfaces a sensation of
exactly that which their neurological connection bypasses--the
flesh. And paradoxically, in human-to-human sex, the flesh which
facilitates contact also functions as an obstacle, creating the
potential for miscommunication and misunderstanding. While humans must
navigate through the flesh to attain unity, the Oankali bypass it
entirely by routing directly into the brain's pleasure centers,
eliminating the space for physical discomfort and even repulsion. This
immediate connection facilitated by the ooloi offers, as Nikanj
explains, it "a oneness that your people strive for, dream of, but
can't truly attain alone" (359). The pleasures that come from physical
sensation, the feeling of which is heightened in sex, is what enables
the Oankali, to crave, rather than fear, difference. 

The importance of bodily effects and sensations speaks to one critical
debate about the influence of the body, in particular, the influence
of biology, on identity and behavior in the novel. [fn:6] While
critics mostly disagree on whether Butler deconstructs or reinforces
biological categories and essentialist notions of behavior, they do
agree on the primacy of heterosexuality, with Haraway claiming that
"Heterosexuality remains unquestioned, if more complexly mediated"
(380). [fn:7] I would suggest, however, that the bypassing of flesh to
simultaneously invigorate fleshy sensation requires a new
understanding of sexuality, one that disrupts the traditional
boundaries of subjectivity. Here, I draw from Jayna Brown's emphasis
on the flesh and how it opens possibilities for reconceiving
subjectivity. According to Brown, while the senses "individuate us,
demarcate our boundaries," they also "mark the ways our bodies are
open. The body, the self, is porous, receptive, impressionable" (Brown
14). In the novel, this openness to feeling is achieved by re-routing
around the flesh and its senses, the traditional channel for feeling,
in a way that emphasizes that which it bypasses. The effect is to
transform cognitive and conceptual phenomena into physical, sensual
experiences.

Here, separateness is crucial for enabling connection. While direct
connection can momentarily dissolve the boundaries of the individual,
a distance between self and other energizes sensation and
understanding. For example, when Lilith asks Nikanj to share its
feelings of grief after Joseph's untimely death: "It gave her... a new
color. A totally alien, unique, nameless thing, half seen, half felt
or... tasted. A blaze of something frightening, yet overwhelmingly,
compelling" (Butler 429). Despite their direct neural connection, the
description here derives its expressive power on the quality of
unknowability, using formations of liminality, ("half seen, half
felt," "alien," "a new color"). Within the context of identity
politics, Chicana scholar Norma Alarcón warns against the dangers of
what she calls "ontologiz[ing] difference."  The challenge is to
achieve connection without totally subsuming the other into totalizing
and therefore oppressive paradigms of subjectivity. She explains that,
"The desire to translate as totalizing metphorical substitution
without acknowledging the "identity-in-difference," so that one's own
system of signification is not disrupted through a historical concept
whose site of emergence is implicated in our own history, may be
viewed as a desire to dominate, constrain, and contain" (133). Rather
than subsume alienness into familiar structures of knowledge, like the
way that Lilith subsumes Jhadaya's tentacles into the similitude of
the terrifying Medusa, the neural connection sustains the difference
in the other.
a
** flesh
Could the flesh, which poses a problem for intra-human connection,
also offer a solution to this problem? In what follows, I explore two
how two very different fields--Black Feminist Studies and Media
Archaeology--offer critical methods for thinking through
materiality. Black Feminist Studies explores the concept of the flesh
within the context of slavery, while Media Archaeology explores the
materiality of electronic media and processing. Though vastly
different in focus, both areas of inquiry share a similar investment
in reading into surfaces to see how they offer new modes for thinking
and resistance. Their theorizations of materiality, which index a
liminal space where meaning is simultaneously ascribed and obscured,
will become the ground for my analysis of the intersections of
hardware and software in my next and final section, "Skin."

*** Black Feminist Studies
In Black Feminist Studies, critics like Hortense Spillers, C. Riley
Snorton, and Amber J. Musser read racial and gendered processes, a
"symbolic order" or "American grammar," in Hortense Spillers words,
ascribed to Black bodies since the violences of trans-Atlantic slavery
(68). In her influential essay, "Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe: An
American Grammar Book," Spillers describes the Black body as a stack
of "attentuated meanings, made in excess over time, assigned by a
particular historical order" (65). The "severing of the captive body
from its motive will," creates a what Spillers calls a "stunning
conntradiction (67). Here, the contradiction is between the body's
reduction to materiality, "reduc[ing] to a thing, becoming being for
the captor," and the simultaneous layering of signification,
"becom[ing] the source of an irresistible, destructive sensuality"
(67). First, there is a reduction of the body to its bare
physicality--into flesh--a material substance for labor and
exchange. At the same time, however, this reduction also opens a
possiblity for signification, which aspects of sensuality,
objectificaiton, otherness, and powerlessness can be layered onto the
flesh.  Spillers, and thinkers in Black Feminist Studies who build
from flesh as the "zero degree of social conceptualization," call this
simultaneous reduction and accumulation of meaning "pornotroping"
(Spillers 67). The next critical move is to take what has been a
method of reduction, what has been a tool for appropriating the
complexity of real world objects for the purpose of exploitation
toffff instead seek out moments of obfuscation or forclosure which is
in tension with objectification. From the reduction of the Black body
to flesh, Black Feminist Studies reads a resistance that is not quite
empowerment, but which is also not subordination, something slippery,
shifting, which multiplies rather than resolves meaning.

I begin with the concept of "foreclosure," which Musser explains,
involves "hold[ing] violence and possibility in the same frame"
(12). Pushing against trends in Afropessimism that take the pornotrope
as a foreclosure of Black subjectivity, Musser explores how
foreclosure, the denial of access or knowledge, offers possibilities
for new modes of relation. Attention to the violence of the pornotrope
brings to the surface relations that are in tension with the desire to
dominate, "allow[ing] us to see the radical potential of excess
without flattening the violence at its core" (Musser 9). For example,
a brilliant surface can foreclose access to interiority in a way that
creates multiple registers of interpretation. Musser demonstrates this
"surface effect" in the painting /Origin of the Universe 1/ (2012) by
artist Mickalene Thomas, whose depiction of a female vulva references
French painter Gustave Courbet's /Origine du Monde/ (1866). In
Thomas's piece, the Black and rhinestone-encrusted vulva creates a
brilliant surface as a "formal strategy of producing opacity" (Musser
48). By instrumentalizing the opacity of surface effects, this work
multiplies the potentiality of readings. Here, the foreclosure of
interiority works alongside a more pronounced subtext of
objectification about the commodification of the black female
body. Musser asserts that to the rhinestones function simultaneously
on two registers: first, their flashiness "as a reminder of the long
association between black people and the commodity" (50); and second,
as a brilliance that evokes wetness, suggesting sexual pleasure. Both
possibilities exist not only side-by-side, but are in tension:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Thinking the rhinestone as a trace or residue of Thomas’s wetness and
excitement allows us to hold violence, excess, and possibility in the
same frame. Even as the source is ambiguous, the idea that rhinestones
might offer a record of pleasure—-pleasure that is firmly constituted
in and of the flesh—-shows us a form of self-possession. This self is
not outside of objectification, but its embellishment and insistence
on the trace of excitement speaks to the centrality of pleasure in
theorizations of self-love. 63
#+END_QUOTE
The significatory system that commodifies the black vulva exists
alongside a production of pleasure. This surface whose opacity seems
to insist upon itself facilitates a simultaneity of registers,
enabling a movement, or a shift, between one and the other, like a
shifting between frames. This brilliant surface enables one to
apprehend this movement from one frame to another, from "violence", to
"excess," and finally, to "possibility."

Foreclosing access to interiority creates a state where meaning is
fugitive, where bodies slip in and out of signification. The concept
of fugitivity, or escape, is based on a condition of commodification
where Black bodies have undergone a reduction to exchange value, a
condition that C. Riley Snorton calls the "fungible." Snorton argues
this fungibility of black flesh turns bodies into "malleable matter,"
enabling a fugitivity from markers of sex and gender (20). He
illustrates this effect with stories of fugutive slaves, such as of
Harriet Jacobs, whose escape from slavery in 1842 is documented in
/Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl/ (1861). Snorton explains how
the "blackening" of Jacobs's face with charcoal endows her with a
level of "fungibility, thingness" to pass as a man, even deceiving
those who knew her well (Snorton 71). As oppposed to traditional
racial "passing" that assumes a degrees of whiteness, the increase of
blackness further reduces flesh toward a "gender indefiniteness" that
enables escape (56). By undergoing a reduction, black flesh enables an
escape from signification that simultaneously opens significatory
potential. 

This fungibility creates an almost chaotic state in which the black
body becomes suceptible to multiple mappings of meaning and can
therefore slip in and out of signification. Snorton offers up an
example of the daguerrotype, an early photographic technology that
involves using chemicals on silver plates. Snorton explains that
dagguerotype offers "a visual grammar for reading the imbrications of
'race' and 'gender' under captivity" (Snorton 40). It does so by
flipping expectations about surface and depth: here, rather than
perpetuating the idea that depth exists below the surface, the surface
becomes a ground for the layering of depth. Snorton describes the
effect of this this flip as creating an "unmappability" of meaning: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... the daguerreotype provides a series of lessons about power, and
racial power in particular, as a form in which an image takes on
myriad perspectives because of the interplay of light and dark, both
in the composition of the shot and in the play of light on the
display. That the image does not reside on the surface but floats in
an unmappable elsewhere offers an allegory for race as a procedure
that exceeds the logics of a bodily surface, occuring by way of flesh,
a racial mattering that appears through puncture in the form of a
wound or covered by skin and screened from view. 40
#+END_QUOTE
The physical material of the image, that is the silvered copper plate
of the daguerreotype, at once solidifies its ground and indexes a
liminal space, what Snorton describes as the "unmappable elsewhere."
The image of the daguerrotype, which changes according to angle and
lighting, evokes the condition of racialization as "a procedure that
exceeds the logics of a bodily surface" while nonetheless adhering to
that surface, "a racial mattering that appears through puncture."
Snorton's curious use of the word "puncture" perhaps revises Roland
Barthes's concept of the "punctum," suggesting instead a lack of
localization or circumscription to a specific point.[fn:8] That the
image resists fixity is crucial for undersanding the way that the
physical registers interact with symbolic ones in the collision of
flesh and racialization.

With quite different political focus, thinkers in Media Archaeology
offer deep readings of digital media and technological processes to
tease out the role of materiality in as hardware and software stacks
and how they produce seemingly immaterial surface forms. N. Katherine
Hayles, for example, resists assumptions about digital immateriality,
which has been in production since the emergence of computing
technologies in the mid-20th century. Media Studies theorist Friedrich
Kittler famously encapsulates this idea of matterless media:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The general digitization of channels and information erases the
differences among individual media. Sound and image, voice and text
are reduced to surface effects, known to consumers as interface. Sense
and the senses turn into eyewash. Inside the computers themselves
everything becomes a number: quantity without image, sound or
voice. /Grammophone/ 1
#+END_QUOTE 
Working to unflatten the "surface effects," Hayles's research traces
how "information lost its body," that is, how information processing,
the calculation and manipulation of symbols, displaces the physical
matter upon which it relies. Hayles disarticulates the binary of
information/hardware which, she argues, extends liberal humanist
ideology of mind/matter into the "posthuman," where a dominant,
unmarked rationality is privileged over embodied experience and
especially, embodied difference. Whereas the liberal humanist subject
is characterized by classical mind/body divisions and hierarchies that
posit embodiment as separate from and subordinate to intelligence, in
which the rational mind possesses a body, the postuman is
characterized by informational patterns that inhabit a physical
vessel, such as a body or a machine. According to Hayles, this
progression from possession to inhabitation suggests that the next
move will be to transcend the material realm altogether, as
consciousness can be uploaded to a virtual space where life itself is
infinite. As Hayles explains, "Information, like humanity, cannot
exist apart from embodiment that brings it into being as a material
entity in the world; and embodiment is always instantiated, local, and
specific" ("Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers", 1993, 91).

*** Media Archaeology Studies
In what follows, I will draw some parallels between Black Feminist
Studies and Media Archaeology. The first parallel has to do with the
concept of displacement, which is related to that of foreclosure. As
Matt Kirschenbaum explains, "Digital inscription is a form of
displacement... remov[ing] digital objects from the channels of direct
human intervention" (86). Kirschenbaum uses the term "forensic
materiality" to refer to the most innaccessible level of computer
hardware, of the hard drive. Here, data is encoded in markings of one
of two (binary) marks on a magnetized surface, a north polarity
signifying "1", or a south polarity signifying "0". Examining these
binary digits, or "bits," through magnetic force microscopy,
Kirschenbaum notes that each one is unique: "The bits themselves prove
strikingly autographic, all of them similar but no two exactly alike,
each displaying idiosyncrasies and imperfections--in much the same way
that conventional letterforms, both typed and handwritten, assume
their own individual personality under extreme magnification" (62)
That electronic data, at its core, corresponds to physical markings
shatters the illusion of digital immateriality, of a stream of code
all the way down.

To trace the transformations of these physical elements as they travel
up the software stack, Hayles offers the concept of "flickering
signifers." Here, she brings Jacques Lacan's "floating signifier," the
idea that a word does have a stable referent, but "floats" above a
text and attains its meaning through a play of difference against
other words, to illustrate the interplay between the immateriality of
the screen and the materiality of the computer hardware. Rather than
destabilize meaning, the flickering signifier dissolves the illusion
of immateriality by grounding it to physcial signals that move through
the software stack:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As I write these words on my computer, I see the lights on the video
screen, but for the computer the relevant signifiers are magnetic
tracks on disks. Intervening between what I see and what the computer
reads are the machine code that correlates alphanumeric symbols with
binary digits, the compiler language that correlates these symbols
with higher-level instructions determining how the symbols are to be
manipulated, the processing program that mediates between these
instructions and the commands I give the computer, and so forth. A
signifier on one level becomes a signified on the next... "Virtual
Bodies" 77
#+END_QUOTE
Hayles's description of this "flexible chain of markers" materializes
the various levels of transformation that digitized inscription must
undergo in order to reach the level of the screen (/Posthuman/
31). First, physical traces on a magnetic surface are mapped into
low-level machine languages which are illegible to human
readers. Then, these patterns are translated into Assembly languages
that pertain to the computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU), the main
processor that executes instructions, arithmetic, and logic. Finally,
as data moves up the stack, it abstracts into high level programming
languages like Python and JavaScript and their effects on the screen,
which humans interact with in the form of the Graphical User Interface
(GUI). While apparently immaterial text and objects have a "tendency
toward unexpected metamorphoses, attenuations, and dispersions," they
are grounded in a physical reality (Hayles, "Virtual Bodies," 76).

To challenge the "illusion of immaterial behavior," the illusion that
objects on the screen appear, disappear, and move without a physical
origin, Kirschenbaum offers the concept of "formal materiality"
(11). While forensic materiality consists of physical inscriptions,
such as magnetic traces on hard drives, formal materiality describes
these traces as they are computed up the software stack, through
levels of programming languages toward specific interface effects on
the screen. It describes not only display and appearance, but also the
way that these are deliberately produced to reinforce fluidity and
ephemerality. Kirschenbaum explains that as data moves up the stack,
it is continually refreshed to fix errors and idiosynracies that occur
during transmission. As a result, formal materiality on the screen
"exist[s] as the end product of long traditions and trajectories of
engineering that werer deliberately undertaken to achieve and
implement it (137). He likens this process of data normalization older
technologies like the telegraph that use relay systems to reinforce
signals over long stretches of transmission. As data moves through
electronic processing, signal "reinvigoration," a kind of "allographic
reproduction," refreshes and standardizes it through approximation
rather than exact copying, so that materiality is a "manufactured"
phenomenon (136).

Although the screen functions as a buffer between the user and the
digital inscription, there is in actuality an inverse relationship
between digital abstraction and tactile manipulation. The higher that
data climbs up the levels of abstraction, the more manipulable it
becomes, a state which Kirschenbaum calls "digital volatility"
(140). For example, by dragging and right clicking on items on the
screen, users can move, duplicate, or delete large quantities of
data. Kirschenbaum explains this "dynamic tension... between
inscription and abstraction, digitality and volitality" makes formal
materiality more susceptible to movement and change than physical
inscription, which remains inaccessible. Perhaps unintuitively, moving
away from inscription is a move toward something that users can handle
and "touch," as anybody who has dragged a file from one folder to
another can confirm.

Another more subtle force operates in the translation between one
coding language into another--that of torque. Kirschenbaum describes
this force as a "procedural friction or perceived difference... as a
user shifts from one set of software logics to another"
(13). Typically in physics, objects rotate along their pivot point,
where the distributional weight is zero. Torque, however, is
characterized by a rotational movement, combining energy from two
directions: first, from the external force acting upon the object, and
second, from the relation between the point of contact on the object
and its pivot point, or the point along the object where it can be
balanced.[fn:4] Torque therefore measures a force that relies on
distance between the point of contact the object's center. Applied to
data, this term refers to the gap between one signficatory system and
another, such as a machine-level programming language and its a more
abstracted language, or the rendition of the same on the screen, as
data travels up the software stack.

Each stage of data transformation instantiates a formal materiality, a
flickering signifier which simultaneously depends upon and obscures
the levels of forensic materiality below. Energized by a sense of
volatility in data and by torque between software registers, this
chain of transformations culminates at the screen, where the end user
experiences them as visual and haptic effects. These "screen effects"
of digital media relate to "surface effects" of the flesh in Black
Feminist Studies. Here, critics read methods of resistance, such as
foreclosure and unmappability, from the reduction of the body into
flesh. In foreclosing access to interiority, the reduction to surface
opens the possibility of fugitivity, where meaning escapes into
irresolvable or incongruent registers. In the next section, I will
demonstrate in practice how the concepts of flickering signifiers,
volatility, and torque engage with those of foreclosure, fugitivity,
and unmappability to read the screen effects in a hypermedia literary
work, /skinonskinonskin/.

     CLOSED: [2023-06-26 Mon 13:46]
There is a tension between control and connection playing through the
work. This tension emerges in "surface effects," like haptics. 

Reading the underlying code deepens the interpretion of surface
effects. Of conceptual objects that elude our manual control. Moving
from one register (conceptual/logical) to another register
(sensual/tactile).

***** air.html -> multiplicity of movement, intractible movement
- surface effect: challenges tactile ability, objects moving toward
  and against like magnets.
- The way the object move on the screen is influenced by the coding
  logics below the surface. if/else statement in code reflects duality
  of movement (either toward or against) and of the objects (there are
  two figures).
  - a simple if/else directive. *Conditional statement is a reduction*
    of choices, of nuance to an either/or. All movement is defined by
    a very simple yes or no condition. *Something that is binary and
    very controlled can enable all kinds of movement*. There is an
    escape here, something fugitive, in the way that *their bodies
    eludes the mouse*. They cannot be caught.
-> Racialization: 
   - But there is also a reduction here, the two bodies are reduced to
     small images, where the differences between them are visible but
     minor, in shape and color.

***** control.html -> lagging movement, uncontrollable 
- surface effect: user manually turns Harvey's head, gets bits of alt
  text.
- this piece is about control -- it plays with the control of the
  female body in the haptics that are sensual but laggy. The haptics
  indicate that full control is not possible, there is something
  intractible about it. 
- there are multiple registers here, from the surface effects to the
  code. The underlying code contains the full message. The surface
  only shows parts which are incoherent.
- the lack of control results from what's happening at the level of
  software. Torque. 
- Racialization: intractible control. Most likely by Harvey. 

***** breath.html -> limitations of medium as enabling constraint
- foreclosure of the software and hardware stack can also reinforce
  physicality of medium.
  - Love notes deliberately hidden in the code, meant to be displaced
    and to be discovered.
- compare with dialogue between them in "WHISPERING WINDOWS", which is
  limited to just text, but at two different levels (public and
  private) and imbued with tone, intimacy, reassurance. 
  - The limitations of the communication medium facilitate a
    sensuality. The limitation reinforces sensuality of the language,
    of the utterance and of the tone.

***** words.html -> flash foreclosure
- Flash media is totally inaccessible, made up of machine code that is
    unreadable to human eyes.
- we can engage with it only through abstraction, where objects are
  separated into components, into shapes, sounds, and movements.
- What I call a total foreclosure, because underneath is completely
  incomprehensible, a bytestream. 

***** reduction of the black body
- One surface effect is to turn depth of real physical objects in the
  world into surface. 
- Love is expressed in surface forms, "pixellust" or "ASCIIlust"
  creating a "home for us" "in the network".
- reduction to surface flattens aspects that might be obstacles in the
  real world. Geography, culture, race. 
-> this is the unmappable surface, where the signifier floats free of
  its referent in the physical world. We cannot locate with precision
  the skin color, hair color, country, as expressed on the screen.

*** /skinonskinonskin/
**** intro
Now, I turn to /skinonskinonskin/ (1999), a work of "net art" created
by Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn, under their collaborative artist's
name /Entropy8Zuper!/. /skin/ documents the inception of their love
affair, which began in an internet chat room and evolved into a
digital correspondence, or "digital love letters"
("/skinonskinonskin/" /Net Art Anthology/). These letters took the
form of individual web pages, designed by Samyn and Harvey, containing
notes, images, and interative elements using early web tools and
animation software, much of which is now defunct or unsupported. The
Rhizome.org /Net Art Anthology/, where the work is preserved with
emulator software, describes it as a "complex portrait of an artistic
and romantic relationship that shows that online intimacy is as deeply
felt, embodied, and full of risk and reward as any other form"
("/skinonskinonskin/").

/skin/ takes part in a body electronic work called "Electronic
Literature," which is now practically inaccessible with modern
technology. Electronic Literature, which spans several subgenres, like
hypertext fiction, network literature, interactive fiction, and
generative text share a common interest in expressing and exploring
digitality as an aesthetic. This work, like many in Electronic
Literature, is inaccessible to modern web browsers. Though most of it
is written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which continues to be
the default language for the web, it is animated by depreciated
versions of JavaScript code and now obsolete Flash software. Besides
the outdated code, it also has an incompatibility with platform, the
Netscape 4 browser, which could run on both MAC and PC systems
(rendering pages on both Harvey's Mac and Samyn's PC) at the
time. Netscape's decline in the late 1990s and early 2000s brought
with it the depreciation of HTML and JavaScript elements that
characterized its associated web authoring tools and practices.

In what follows, I embark on a close reading of the work's "surface
effects," that is, the appearance and interactivity of objects and
words on the screen. I emphasize how these elements facilitate a
haptic engagement, a sense of touch and movement through the user's
mouse. Then, I turn to the underlying source code, the HTML,
JavaScript, and Flash files, to examine how the coding layer, another
level of formal materiality, might influence the reading of the work's
surface effects. Here, I explore how programming concepts and
structures might enhance the reading of visible and interactive
elements on the screen. I find that the different registers of
abstraction across surface effects and code suggest a tension
throughout the work between control and communication.

**** air.html
First, I examine "air.html" page, which depicts an animation of two
small figures floating in black space. The two figures, which
represent the Samyn and Harvey, float in a horizontal, flying position
over a field of a field of rotating green lines, which evoke a
rolling, cyber-landcape. Each figure can be moved by the cursor as it
pans across the screen, attracting them like magnets. While they slide
effortlessly in all directions, coaxing precise movements from the
figures requires precise mouse manipulations that challange the user's
tactile ability. By using slow movements, the user can bring the
individual bodies into contact, but they can never cross each other,
or cross to the other's side of the screen. Samyn's body remains
confined to the left, while Harvey's is to the right. [SEE GIF] The
initial illusion of free floating, therefore, is deceiving.

[include gif of air.html]

This animation is defined in the source code of the page, in a series
of functions written in JavaScript, the standard language for defining
interactive elements on web pages. Below is an excerpt of one
JavaScript function called ~flyMouse()~:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
if ( mouseX < halfW )

	{

	var mFactor = 0.1;

	var aFactor = 0.01;

	}

else

	{

	var mFactor = 0.01;

	var aFactor = 0.1;

	};

...

dMove('flyingmL','document.',mLeft + thisXDiff*mFactor,mTop + 
thisYDiff*mFactor);

...

dMove('flyingaL','document.',aLeft + thisXDiff*aFactor,aTop + thisYDiff*aFactor);
#+END_SOURCE
The direction and speed of the bodies' movement hinges on the if/else
statement above. An "if/else" statement, or conditional statement, is
a core construct in programming, which exists across many programming
languages. The conditional statement determines the "control flow," or
the order of operations, in a block of code based on whether a
specific condition is true or whether it is false. Underlying the
if/else statement is the Boolean data type, which can be either ~True~
or ~False~. Checking whether a condition is ~True~ or ~False~ enables
programmers to write code that makes decisions, so to speak, to
execute the relevant block of code that matches the condition. For
example, an email inbox will display unread emails in bold formatting
depending on whether or not that email has been opened by the
user. Behind the scenes, an if/else statement checks if the email has
been opened, and if it has, the email will render with regular
formatting, and if it has not, it will render in bold formatting. In
the if/else statement on "air.html," the movement of the bodies is
conditional on their distance between the mouse and the original
positioning of the bodies on either side of the screen. Depending on
this distance, the magnetic force for each of the bodies is multiplied
against a factor of .1 or .01. This results in a stronger movement
from Samyn's body when the mouse is near Samyn's original position on
the left side of the screen, and a stronger movement from Harvey's
body when the mouse is on the right half of the screen, near Harvey's
original position. The conditional statement is thus a reduction of
possible choices to an either/or, where all movement depends on a
simple yes or no condition.

The binary nature of this conditional statement--it can be true or it
can be false, and there are two resulting actions--reflects an
animation that is, at its core, about a dual force. But this dual
force, either attraction or repulsion from the mouse, enables movement
across all directions of the screeen. The binary structure of the
if/else statement, in which bodies move toward and against each other,
thus faciliates a multiplicity of movement. In that movement, there is
something intractible, something fugitive, about the way that the
figures are drawn to but resist being controlled by the mouse. These
figures, which have been reduced to two small pixelated images of
Harvey and Samyn's naked bodies. Here, the movement by the hand and
the oppsitional constraints which the user comes up against, engage
the transformations that take place in the level of code.

**** control.html
If "air.html" plays with binary movement, another page,
"control.html," plays with lag. The page consists of a monochrome
green image of Harvey's head, which rolls from side to side in the
direction of the user's cursor as it pans over the image. As the
cursor moves, exposing Harvey's face at different angles, it also
displays peices of "alt-text," short for "alternative text," triggers
the displays descriptive text meant to stand in place of the image,
for accessibility reasons and in the case that the image fails to
load. The alt-text here contains words like "go" "believe" "ocean" and
"mind," depending on the cursor's location over the image. The tactile
qualities of this page, in which the user manually turns Havery's head
from one side ot another with the cursor-as-hand, are further
emphasized by the cursor itself, which appears as a pointing hand.

The surface of the peice only reveals part of the full message. First,
while most pages contain an author, title, and date, this one only
contains a title, "you:controlMe." It seems that the page was created
by Harvey addressing a message for Samyn to "control" her by moving
her face back and forth across the image. Second, the source code
reveals that the animation consists of 23 images, each of which is
associated with a specific alt-text and coordinate. Here, the full
message of the alt-text, which is hidden from the screen, appears in a
list like formate: "i believe in it you created it in my mind my mind
cannot let it go the ocean the waves its a vision." Each of these
images and its associated message is tied to a specific coordinate on
the screen's surface, which activates the relevant image and
alt-text. Thus the effect of Harvey's head moving across the screen is
in reality an image that has been activated by the mouse on a specific
coordinate and has been super-imposed on the screen. Rather than
represent a smooth movement from side to side, Harvey's head takes
little jumps from one position to another. The effect is a slight lag,
a series of fleeting pauses that intensify Harvey's direct gaze into
the camera.

When we examine the source code, we see that this peice is about
control, specifically, with control over the female body. It deploys
layers of foreclosure, where the source code contains the full message
and workings of the animation, to create a haptic effect that is
sensual but laggy. The haptics with the mouse indicate that full
control of Harvey's head and full access to the message is not
possible, there is something intractible about it. What's happening at
the level of code influences this screen effect. 

**** breath.html
Below the overt narrative of surface effects, lies another narrative
within the source code, where hidden messages mix natural language
with computer language to make verbal exhortations of love. On one
page, "breath.html," the surface effects consists of an animated male
torso that swells slightly and emits a breathing sound when the mouse
pans over it, accelerating with each swipe of the mouse. The effect is
sensual, tactile, and auditory. In within the the HTML and JavaScript
that defines the content and animations in the source code are words
meant only for human eyes: a list of "whispers," romantic
protestations like "i will love you forever" and "i want to breath
you." Unlike "control.html," these messages do not manifest directly
on the browser, but only appear in the pages's source code: 
#+BEGIN_SOURCE
whispers[0] = "breath me";

whispers[1] = "i will love you forever";

whispers[2] = "skin";

whispers[3] = "skin on skin";

whispers[4] = "skin on skin on skin";

whispers[5] = "implode";

whispers[6] = "soft";

whispers[7] = "slow";

whispers[8] = "can you feel me?";

whispers[9] = "touch me";

whispers[16] = "yesss";

whispers[17] = "deeper";

whispers[19] = "warm";
#+END_SOURCE
Musser describes foreclosure as an overflow of surface effects that
precludes access below the surface. She describes the effect of
foreclosure as encouraging alternative modes of relationality.  This
peice not only demonstrates how computer screens inherently contain a
level of foreclosure that masks inaccessible elements in the source
code. It also suggests that displacement opens further channels for
communication. Here, the works title, in the source code. It also
suggests that displacement opens further channels for
communication. Here, the work's title, "skin on skin on skin," is
reserved for the curious user to come and find them in the source
code.

**** whispering windows
The foreclosure of the surface can open up sensual possibilities for
communication across electronic media. An early chatroom conversation
between Samyn and Harvey, published on their website under the title
"Whispering Windows," uses two modes for communication. Samyn, under
the username /zuper/, writes under a private mode, while Harvey, under
/womanonfire/, uses the public one. If there are others in the
chatroom, they have been removed from the transcript. The chat
records their frustrated attempts to connect video and sound:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
womanonfire: the sound is a bit distorted with these things

zuper: (private) yes

womanonfire: if no one was around me here

zuper: (private) the image is distorted too

womanonfire: i would speak to you

zuper: (private) but that's ok

womanonfire: yes!

womanonfire: these are all part of our relationship

womanonfire: these limitations

womanonfire: we must

zuper: (private) 26 letters, no sound, no image

womanonfire: learn new ways

zuper: (private) make DHTMLove to me... http://entropy8zuper.org/
#+END_QUOTE
The limitations of the medium, the "26 letters" of the alphabet and
their appearance on the screen, are the only material for "making
love."  These limitations, however, work to emphasize a sense of
intimacy between the conversants. /womanonfire/ tends to cut her
syntax into pithy expressions like "these limitations" and "we must"
that arrest her thought and restart it on the next line. /zuper/
responds in "private" mode with gentle reassurances ("but that's
okay") and encouragement that sustains and reinforces her thoughts
("make DHTML love to me"), and read like a whisper. Reduced to digital
character on a screen, the love affair expresses a strong sense of
intimacy and mutuality. It is because of the limitations of the
medium, that elements like tone and syntax are magnified and able to
portray this level of closeness.

**** words.html
Some levels of displacement are so removed that they can only be
engaged through abstraction. On example appears on "words.html." This
page, created by Samyn on Valetine's Day, 1999, displays a beating
heart overlaid with phrases that fly in various arcs from the
center. The JavaScript code for this page does reveals the workings of
the animation: first, the phrases, which will arc over and around the
beating heart, are saved into a list format. Then, a series JavaScript
functions accomplishes the following in turn: it selects words from
their position on the list, then calculates their trajectory across
the screen, then the time limit for their movement, and finally resets
their position to restart the loop.[fn:5] Below is an excerpt of the
source code (the function ~floatWord()~) that defines this animation:
#+BEGIN_SOURCE
function floatWord(thisNumber)

{

var randTime = (rand(15) + 5 )*1000;

var thisRand = rand(4);

if ( thisRand == 1 ) { 
dMoveStraight('wordL'+thisNumber,'document.',-100-rand(100),rand(stageH),randTime,'wordVal'+thisNumber,'rePos(' +
thisNumber + ');',''); }

else if ( thisRand == 2 ) {
dMoveStraight('wordL'+thisNumber,'document.',rand(stageW),-20-rand(100),randTime,'wordVal'+thisNumber,'',''); }

else if ( thisRand == 3 ) {
dMoveStraight('wordL'+thisNumber,'document.',stageW + rand(100),rand(stageH),randTime,'wordVal'+thisNumber,'rePos(' + thisNumber + ');',''); }

else if ( thisRand == 4 ) {
dMoveStraight('wordL'+thisNumber,'document.',rand(stageW),stageH + rand(100),randTime,'wordVal'+thisNumber,'',''); }

if ( rand(4) == 1 ) { dShow('wordL'+thisNumber,'document.','visible'); };
}; "words.html"
#+END_SOURCE
JavaScript, a notoriously complex language by today's standards, was
relatively more convoluted in 1999. But even more inaccessible than
the code animating the words is that animating the beating heart. The
visual and sound effect of its beat is created with Flash, an
animation authoring tool that was widely popular in the late 1990s and
early 2000s. Flash gained popularity for its ability to deliver
relatively advanced graphics (such as video and sound) at a time when
media-rich content traveled slowly over the web. Over the last 10
years, however, the development of newer, more efficient and secure
animation technologies brought Flash into obsolescence. On December
31st, 2020, the software was officially discontinued, though it had
already been functionally replaced with updated versions of HTML and
Javascript that could deliver what Flash offered in much more
flexible, portable, and efficient ways. This termination, however,
made a generation of internet games, net art, and electronic
literature nearly completely inoperable. Today, the only way to view
Flash content in something like its original context is through
plugins or emulators, like the one hosted on /Rhizome.org/ that
enables viewers to read /skin/ through a Netscape 4 window.

[SEE IMAGE/GIF of BEATING HEART] 

Leaving aside its obsolescence, Flash code is a highly inaccesible
software. This is due to Flash code being a binary code format, unlike
text-based code like HTML and JavaScript, which is human-readable and
renders in the source code of web pages and in text-editor. If a Flash
file is opened in a text editor, it would appear as an
incomprehensible stream of obscure characters and symbols, some of
which the text editor may recognize, and others which the editor would
display as a question mark. For example, the below image displays a
flash file (which usually have an ".swf" or ".fla" extention) that
defines the sound animation of of the heatbeat:

[IMAGE OF TEXT EDITOR OF OF HEARTBEAT.SWF]

Because this code is unreadable to the human eye, it requires specific
authoring software to work with it. A "Flash Decompiler" program, for
this purpose, offers an interface for seeing the components of a Flash
file without having to work with the machine code layer. In the below
image of one such program, the file is separated into individual
components like "sounds," "frames," and "scripts," visible on the left
sidebar. The interface here abstracts the machine code so that humans
can make sense of it. For example, one can make changes to the
animation, such as distort the sound of the heartbeat which is
contained within the "frames" component.

[IMAGE OF FLASH DECOMPILER INTERFACE ON "HEARTBEAT.SWF"]

The Flash elements throughout this work, which appear on many of its
pages, illustrate the displacement inherent to electronic media. In
order to work with Flash media, abstraction is necessary. Objects on
the screen are separated into components, into shapes, sounds, and
movements. But these components themselves are surface
effects. Immediately beneath them is a bytestream, a torrent of
symbols and characeters that cannot be read with human eyes. The
object can be rendered in with the decompiler is only another kind of
surface effect. This is an example of total foreclosure of formal
materiality of the technological stack, a kind of foreclosure that
points to physicality of the surface.

**** reduction of the black body
Another surface effect is to turn the depth of real physical objects
in the real world into surface. This especially includes physical
objects or realities that create communicative barriers. In another
online chat, Samyn and Harvey revel in the intimacy that this mode of
communication enablesw, even while struggling with the limitations of
the audio and video and video connection:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
womanonfire: i wonder wht your voice is like

zuper: my voice?

womanonfire: i cant tell anymore

zuper: pixellust?

womanonfire: right

zuper: I my case only ASCIIlust...

womanonfire: but i want to make a home for us

womanonfire: in the network
#+END_QUOTE
The relationship between /womanonfire/ and /zuper/ is completely
constrained by restrictions. That /womanonfire/ "can just barely
make...out" /zuper/ is "fitting" because the physical barriers that
separate their connection are considerable. Yet, /zuper/ responds that
he feels "so close" despite his distance, a phenomenon which he
"doesn't understand [himself]". Perhaps the reason can be traced to
the surface effects of their communication, to the objects on the
screen which enable a "pixellust." That they question whether the
connection is really love, or if it's lust reinfoces a magnetic
quality that this physically tenuous connection, which is full of
network lags and failures, can enable. Later on in the conversation,
the strength of their surface connection, which overcomes geography,
seems to overcome additional obstacles like language difference and
race:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
zuper: (private) I realised today that I have never been in love with somebody who doesn't speak Dutch before.

womanonfire -> zuper: i have never been in love with someone in another country before

zuper: (private) I have never been in love with someone with green dreadlocks before

zuper: (private) let alone black skin

womanonfire -> zuper: yes i hope you wiwll like my skin

zuper: (private) I already do.

womanonfire -> zuper: :) http://entropy8zuper.org/ 
#+END_QUOTE
The question of race becomes one in a list of other attributes like
hair color or speaking another language. Here, the reduction of their
communication to letters on a screen flattens physical aspects that
would otherwise be obstacles. This flattening of attributes like hair
and skin color severs them from their location on the physical body,
instead transposing them to words on a screen. Separated from the
referent, they flicker atop the highest level of computational
abstraction. Loosened from its physical manifestation, these
attributes reside somewhere like Snorton's "unmappable elsewhere," a
place that cannot be pinned down. This surface effect, that of
reduction, creates a tenuous connection between the signifier and the
signified. This tenuous connection, while buffeted by concerns about
connectivity that plague the chat, is nonetheless made possible by
network technologies.

**** conclusion
How does race operate on the same register as hair color and language?
Like the bypassing of flesh in "Sex," the foreclosure of depth
paradoxically creates a flattening effect that reinforces physicality
of the uppermost layer, of the surface, the "skin." 

Through vastly different methods, both /Dawn/ and /skin/ explore a
kind of desire that bypasses the physical body with the effect of
magnifying embodied sensation. In /Dawn/, the body proves to be an
obstacle for communication, for the gap between bodies stokes a
debilitating fear of the other that manifests as racialization. This
obstacle is temporarily overcome in the neural connection that the
Oankali facilitate between human partners. In /skin/, the physical
body is also bypassed, but in this case, for a connection across
geographic barriers. Bringing these two texts together enables me to
think through materiality across various contexts, from the
physiological, to the technological, and finally, to the social. The
collapse of mind/body distinction in /Dawn/, and the way this collapse
affects social relations, offers possibilities for reading materiality
into seemingly immaterial media effects in /skin/. These readings, in
turn, off an analogue for understanding how racialization operates
through plays between matter and meaning.

In the "Sex" section, I examine a sensuality that can only be achieved
by bypassing the flesh. In the scrambling of sense and thought in the
sex scenes, where participants cannot differentiate between physical
sensation and mental experience, everything becomes a physical
phenomenon. This paradox in which sensuality is made possible by the
bypassing of flesh reveals a new ethics that prioritizes pleasure at
the cost of consent.

In the "Flesh" section, I explore how the reduction of body to flesh,
a process that began during the violences and atrocities of the Middle
Passage, creates an opportunity for rethinking the political potential
of sensuality and the surface. Here, I examine how the concept of the
Pornotrope creates a ground for new theorizations of meaning and
materiality where exploitation and pleasure co-exist. The "surface
effects" from this section include strategies like foreclosure,
fugitivity, and unmappability--strategies in which the Black flesh,
reduced to surface, is imbued with an intractible significatory
potential.

The theorization of surface effects then becomes a ground for
understanding how physical registers interact with symbolic ones in
the "Skin" section, where I analyze the net art work,
/skinonskinonskin/ (1999). Here, I read surface aesthetics into
multiple layers of formal materiality, such as the computer screen,
but also in programming and machine language logics and structures. My
readings find a tension between control and communication throughout
the work, echoing the tension between pleasure and violence in the
previous sections. The tactile qualities of the net art work, where
the user can manipulate objects on the screen with her mouse, is
complicated by laggy or intractible effects created by the parameters
and structures of the underlying code. The displacement of certain
elements like hidden messages reinforces the levels of formal
materiality that operate throughout the stack with varying degress of
accessibility. At times, total foreclosure precludes access to
subordinate levels of abstraction, where formal materiality gives way
to the forensic level of illegible characters and magnetic traces. In
this state, objects are in tension with the signified, and the surface
itself enables a kind of chaotic state, where everything becomes
skin. This reduction enables racialized flesh to harness the chaos of
significatory possibility. Here, digital objects, distillations of
real world referents, become imbued with expressive potential.

** unstructured fragments

**** haptics
Throughout this work, the user engages with HTML and JavaScript code
via haptics on the browser. The source code endows digital "objects"
with properties and methods so that they can become manipulable at the
level of surface. These constructs, which are defined under the hood
of the browser, enable sensual experiences for the user. 

**** foreclosure / displacement
The surface effects of the screen engage elements within the code,
which are inaccessible to the general user, to surface additional
layers of foreclosure.

This screen surfaces a displacement inherent in all
significatory systems but particularly in machine language systems,
which rely on levels of abstraction in its software stack.

**** obsolete elements
Due to modernization, the browser languages HTML and JavaScript use
now depreciated elements like ~<layers>~ and ~<area>~ to add
animation. Additionally, since Flash technology, a compiled software
that is not "human-readable", has been discontinued, it is very
difficult to find solutions for editing and viewing Flash elements.

**** Hayles on data traveling up the stack
Hayles points out that, "Precisely because the relation between
signifier and signified at each of these levels is arbitrary, it can
be changed with a single global command" (Hayles, "Virtual Bodies"
77).

Flickering signifiers bring consideration of "transformations" into
view. though I do think she is underestimating the "matter," "energy"
which goes into it. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When a text presents itself as a constantly refreshed image rather
than durable inscription, transformations would occur that would be
unthinkable if matter or energy, rather than informational patterns,
formed the primary basis for the systemic exchanges. This textual
fluidity, which humans learn in their bodies as they interact with the
system, imply that signifiers flicker rather than float. 30
#+END_QUOTE

In this movement up the stack, data shifts
between registers and becomes more tangible, a process that is belied
by the fleeting and diaphanous forms that finally emerge on the
computer screen.

Due to this appearance, the flickering signifier perpetuates a liberal
humanist ideology about the body/mind separation into the posthuman
one of hardware/code. Just as the mind rules the fleshy body, so the
/code/ represents a an insubstantial standard that drives computation.

Thinking about the illusion of digital materiality on the screen,
N. Katherine Hayles wonders, "Why do we talk and write incessantly
about the 'text,' a term that obscures differences between
technologies of production and implicitly promotes the work as an
immaterial construct?" ("Flickering Connectivities" 2000,
par. 57).

* Footnotes

[fn:8] As opposed to the "studium," or subject, of a photograph, the
"punctum" is a detail that "pierces" the viewer. See Barthes, /Camera
Lucida/, 27.

[fn:7] There is one exception to this view, from Patricia Meltzer, who argues
that the trilogy, and its third installment specifically, presents a
view of non-normative sexuality which can literally transform bodies
at will. In this book, the human-Oankali constructs evolved the
ability to manipulate organic matter within their own bodies, as
shape-shifting beings who can adapt to their prospective partner's
desires. Drawing from Judith Butler, Meltzer poses a body that is
queer because it is constructed by desire:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Butler's concepts here are positioned neither in a biological
essentialism that insists on gender identity (woman) as derivated of a
body's sex (female), nor in a social and/or psychological
constructivism that udnerstands the body's materiality as dominated by
(social) discourse. Instead, desire and sexuality are based in the
body's need for others... the body follows desire. Meltzer 241
#+END_QUOTE
While other critics point out the disruptions to normativity, like in
those in which the binary is destabilized, upended, where gender roles
are reimagined, here Melzter draws out alternate visions for sex,
gender, and desire altogether. Building from Butler's concept of
performativity, Meltzer defines queerness as resisting the normative
correlation of sex/gender/desire. The failure of easy alignment among
these elements opens up the possibility of imagining how desire can
construct new configurations of sexuality, that are "rooted in the
body's amorphous craving for physical pleasure" (Melzter 236).

I agree with Meltzer that the sex act is a queer one, but not because
of a desire that literally transform bodies. Rather, the sex act is
queer because of the way that it simultaneously bypasses and
invigorates the flesh.

[fn:6] As I have mentioned, one group of critics generally maintain
that the novel destabilizes biological categories its associated
assumptions about behavior, while a second argue that the novel
reinforces biological determinist views. The first group emphasizes
the novel's revision of biological determinist views, particularly
when it comes to gender. "Gender," Haraway argues, "is not the
transubstantiation of biological sexual difference," rather, it is
"kind, syntax, relation, genre" (/Primate Visions/ 377). Critics who
build Haraway's reading, like Catherine S.  Ramirez and Kitty Dunkley,
explore how Butler deploys aspects of biological identity in a
strategic way.  Ramirez explains that Butler strategically deploys
essentialist identity categories, as a tool for "imagining and
mobilizing new subjects and new communities" (395). Within the frame
of humanism, Kitty Dunkley emphasizes Butler's revision the
anthropocentric and patriarchial structures that necessitate essential
notions of gender. An example is the men's fear of the sexual
seduction and penetration by the ooloi, which "threatens to usurp the
men’s position at the pinnacle of a gendered hierarchy" (Dunkley
100). For both Ramirez and Dunkley, the biological "facts" of gender
are deconstructed, rather than reinforced, in the novel. By constrast,
Nancy Jesser centers the role of biological determinism within
Butler's fiction. Jesser boldly asserts that "Genetics is the science
of Butler's fiction. The translation of genotype to phenotype is the
plot" (52). According to Jesser, the novel re-works genetic tendencies
of behavior by deploying feminine traits, like maternal
self-sacrifice, nurture, and relationality, to correct tendencies of
dominance, possessiveness, and aggression typically displayed by the
males (41-42). On this side of the debate, biology is a physical fact
that determines behavior, but can also be re-worked or overcome
through other tendencies.

[fn:3] Mann argues that the novel evokes the concept of "pessimistic
futurism," combining the cynicism of afro-pessimism, which associates
blackness with ontological death and the impossibility of black
subjectivity, and the optimism of afro-futurism, which speculates and
potentializes liberatory black subjectivity and futurity.

[fn:2] The criticism from the novel situates this interplay of
similarity and difference within intersectional or "Women of Color"
feminism, particularly in Chela Sandoval's theorization of
"differential consciousness." Using terms that echo in her famous
followup work, "The Cyborg Manifesto," Donna Haraway describes this
text (and Butler's fiction in general) as being "about the monstrous
fear and hope that the child will not, after all, be like the parent"
(Haraway /Primate Visions/ 387). Catherine S. Ramirez builds from both
Haraway and Chela Sandoval to explore the tension between essentialism
and constructedness in the novel, which she calls an example of
"cyborg feminism"--a feminism that explores a strategic tension
between between "affinity and essence, and "plurality and specificity"
(Ramirez 395). Ramirez argues that, by "critiqu[ing] fixed concepts of
race, gender, sexuality and humanity, and, subsequently, 'fictions' of
identity and community" this work displays a "strategic deployment of
essence," that is, the claiming of a subject position for the purpose
of resisting subjectification (Ramirez 375, 395).


[fn:5] The first function, ~startMove()~, sets a series of timers that
initiate and perpetuate the animation. The second function,
~floatWords()~, loops through the list of words and phrases and passes
individual selections from this list to the next function,
~floatWord()~, which sets the trajectory and timing for their
movement. Within this function, a call to ~rePos()~ repositions the
word in a new location, to begin the cycle anew.

[fn:4]  For example, one could balance a twelve-inch ruler by placing
a finger under the sixth inch. By applying some force to the center of
mass, the object would not pivot, but move in a linear direction,
either up or down, or sideways, depending on the direction of the
force. However, if external force was applied along either side of the
center, say at the second inch, the object would pivot. Its direction
would then be determined by its pivot point, whether that be its
center of mass or the point where the object is affixed to another
object, if the ruler were nailed to the wall, for example. In this
case, the ruler would pivot around this point of attachment, and the
force and direction of its pivot would be measured as "torque."

[fn:1]  Hayles's influential text, /How We Became Posthuman: Virtual
Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics/ (2000), lays out
the "waves of cybernetic development," that is, the development of
systems theory among prominant information and communication theorists
like Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Warren
McCulloch (2).
