Title: Embodiment.. 

Question: How does reading the "fleshiness" of digital media enable
the analysis of literary/textual material?

Fields: Black Feminist Studies (Snorton, Jayna Brown, Zakiyyah Iman
Jackson, and Amber Musser), Media Archaeology/New Materialisms
(Kirschenbaum).

Object: Hyperfiction, particularly /skinonskinonskin/, Science Fiction /Dawn/. 

Method: Close reading of /Dawn/, Media archaeological reading of
/skinonskinonskin/. A methodology of studying digital media which
attends to its physicality, what Kirschenbaum describes as the
forensic and formal levels of materiality.

- title carved into flesh. 

Epigraph: "if ( 1 + 1 == 1 ) { e8z = true; };"
- conditional statement, which is false. But what's it saying? That
"if" is carrying a lot. It's a statement of possibility, saying 1 + 1
might be equal to 1. That the two lovers might be able to combine.

Image of white/blue torso with bright glowing point in center (heart?)
on black background. When mouse pans over the image, the chest
englarges slightly and the sound of breath emits. Can happen at fast
speeds, though is a bit glitchy. 

Code consists of an array of whispers, containing erotic professions
and exhortations.

***** smoke.html
By Harvey

HTML tables, like cells, animated to move up and down and across the
page following the mouse. The movement flutters to evoke smoke. Words
in read are contained at the bottom of each cell.

See screenshot "smoke.png". Here you can apprehend all of the words at
once. 

The script parses out where table elements are defined/assigned,
styled, and animated (JavaScript), and then where they are positioned
(HTML).

***** TODO close.html
By Samyn

The page here only makes sense if you glimpsed the code in the
previous page, "smoke.html". At the center of the page is an image of
the chest from the first vignette, "breath.html." The filenames for
the images populating the tables overlay the image of the chest. At
the bottom two corners are closed fists, which open when clicked to
release an animation of butterflies that flutter over the chest. The
butterflies will move again if the user pans over them, animated by a
whoosing sound like the breathing in "breath.html," but they stay
within the confines of the image. 

The page signifies not only butterflies, but also the words associated
with the filenames overlaid on the chest. These include "sensitive,"
"smoke," "again," and any others in the user's memory. 

Here, code names stand for words. It's surfacing the significatory
system inherent in code, which appends and defines data. It's showing
us the code name for the file rather than the contents of that file. 

***** grid.html
By Samyn

A torso (masculine, different from the first) stuck in a grid, evoking
Neuromancer's cyberspace.

"cursor_mac_flip.gif"?

***** TODO hands.html
By Harvey

You get here after opening the "hands" in "close." The image is of a
black hand pressing on a white outline. Presumably, Harvey's hand
against Samyn's, perhaps on a screen. The code has a message that
confirms: ~<!-- we touch -->~, and confirms Harvey is the
author. Hence the black hand. 
***** horoscope.html
Image of a horoscope exhorting the gemini to be receptive to "hav[ing]
your mind stolen and your heart blown," with alt-text in the HTML

view-source:http://entropy8zuper.org/skinonskinonskin/rhizome/air.html
By Samyn

Two bodies in flying position following the mouse as it pans over a
field of rotating lines, evoking a cyberlandscape. The animations are
like magnets moving toward the mouse when it moves, but the strength
of attraction depends on the mouse's speed. So you can get them to
almost touch with some difficulty. 

The code is just layers of moving lines, with the images as gifs that
are animated by "flyNow()" and "flyMouse" functions, which I do not
understand.

Learning the haptics of the animation. Deeply sensual. 

#+BEGIN_SOURCE

{
var mLeft = dMeasure('flyingmL','document.','left');

	var aFactor = 0.01;

else

	};

We may have our second flash animation. A SWF file of Samyn shirtless,

***** obsessed.html
By Samyn

Animation of a green spiral that moves against the cursor in a circular
motion, its fulcrum on a green circle which, if clicked, opens a new
page, "control.html". 

Again, this is playing with haptics, the effect of opposing and
attracting forces (like "air.html"). 

***** control.html
view-source:http://entropy8zuper.org/skinonskinonskin/rhizome/control.html
No attribution. Title: "you:controlMe"

Complicated to describe. It's a green tinted gif of Harvey's head that
rolls with the mouse, like the cursor is physically moving her
head. Can see more or less of her face this way. Alt text contains a
message with words like "go" "believe" "ocean" "mind." Can only get
the full sentence when reading the code. 

Again, we are playing with haptics, so I think it's Samyn, though this
is opposite of what we expect. The suggests the work is created from
Harvey's perspective, saying "you control me," and Harvey presumably
being the intended user. Or maybe Samyn is taking control by demanding
that Harvey's image submit to the user's mouse. 

How the code works: there are ~<AREA>~ html elements that are coded
with coordinates, image links, and alt text when the mouse pans over
them. The effect is to animate the image according to movement. 

***** missing.html
Large, glitchy, soundless video of Harvey writing "I miss you" on her
arm and showing it to the camera. Cannot see the code, appears to be a
flash file. 

***** control2.html
The same as the original control.html, but with Samyn's face looping
through. 
***** TODO words.html
view-source:http://entropy8zuper.org/skinonskinonskin/rhizome/words.html
By Samyn on valentines day, 1999.

A beating heart, animated by words that move in various arcs from its
center. 

Line 98: "$we are disembodied arms and mouths "

The JavaScript is very detailed in its animation. It sets loops
through words, calculates their trajectory and timing, then resets
their position and starts again.

***** sunday.html
by e8z on 21 February 1999

Very calming. Flash video of views presumably of Belgium. 

Along with "but.html," "travel.html" are flash videos. Not a lot of
access here.

***** unsaid.html
No attribution or date

Image of Mac desktop (Harvey's?) with draggable chat boxes filled with
their conversation. Typical and intense avowals of enduring
love. Inside each chat box is an unsent message in the composition
area. Harvey is showing Samyn her unsent thoughts, in one case, a
thought that was withheld over several of his messages, and then
changed to another. 

One of them contains the interesting phrase by womanonfire: "-i+o",
which evokes a loop (i=0, i<n, i++) and I/O. 

***** TODO hug.html
By Harvey, very clearly with context clues. 

Animation of swirling pieces to the background of upbeat funk music
which collapse into a whole image of Harvey and Samyn hugging when
clicked. Music also changes to a refrain, "This could have been
something, this could have been really something." There's also a
text that appears line by line, which begins hopeful but turns more
and more apologetic and despondant. The breakup betweeh Harvey and her
current partner. She doesn't know if she can leave him and she doesn't
want to leave her whole life. But she loves Samyn and will do what she
can. 

Michael's response, "perfect.html," is a chatbox that says
"bullshit. We would be the perfect couple. Maybe I just say that ..."

"digital love letters" (Rhizome, /Net Art Anthology/) that document a
romance between net artists Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn, who met
online in 1999.

"In /skinonskinonskin/, artistic collaboration and love are shown to be
closely related, two facets of the same fundamental question of how to
relate to the other. The work is a complex portrait of an artistic and
romantic relationship that shows that online intimacy is as deeply
felt, embodied, and full of risk and reward as any other form"
(Rhizome, /Net Art Anthology/)"

Met on hell.com, members only space. Then Michael sent breath.html,
where "Messages of love are hidden in the code" (Rhizome, /Net Art
Anthology/). Proceeded to trade small works of net art on the server

"Putting the user in the role of recipient of their love letters, it

"as much as they wanted to hear one another’s voices (and they did see
glimpses of each other via slow glitchy webcam), they wanted more to
feel a deeper connection with one another, touching one another
through the cursor, hearing the other’s heart beat, listening to the
other breathe" (Johnson).

"Each image follows the same pattern, as if to imply “come to me,” or
“I will come to you,” and upon arrival bliss, over and over."
(Johnson).

Why did they decide to sell this eventually? Out of some capitalistic
impulse? 

"Is love meant to be bought and sold? Having been in love myself, I
know there is a great deal of labor involved. These life-altering
loves take over your life, steal your time, masquerade as obsession,
pick you up, knock you down, steal your mind, time. There are the
tokens to be given and received; the fits of insecurity, infidelity,
failure, excitement. It’s a lot of work to be in love. To make that
life-altering preoccupation available to others to witness is another
added form of work, and since this is a society revolving around
capitalism, it would make sense for the creators of such a love to
charge to view the ephemera from it."

"Compulsively, as the now hyper-social, hyper-subjective, hyper-mobile
web mandates, we share our thoughts, curate them, they’re meant to be
scrolled through, not sat with, nor read over and over again."

Speaking on their new work, an interactive game series called "Tale of
Tales," where the user takes on a deer avatar in a forest to interact
with other deer and elements of the forest without text. Harvey says,
"One need not understand each other to communicate. In fact, keeping
words away. Not being literal but rather allowing aesthetics and in
the case of The Forest, body language, to be the communication" (29).

In another game, /Bientôt l’été/: "As it turns out, the entire world
your avatar lives in is artificial. The other player is real. But they
are playing on another artificial world, far away from yours. When you
close your eyes in the game, you get an impression of the computer
systems that are running this simulation. In a way, /Bientôt l’été/ is
a metaphor for playing videogames." (32).

*** black feminisms and qocq
**** Lorde, Audre. "Uses of the erotic: the erotic as power." Sister
Outsider (1984), pp. 53-59.


Need to reclaim the erotic as a source of power, empowerment through
desire and joy. 

The difference between the erotic and the pornographic: both have to
do with pleasure, but the pornographic supresses feeling, pursuing
only sensation.  “The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of
our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an
internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it,
we know we can aspire” (54).  “erotic… is a question of how actually
and fully we can feel in the doing” (54).

Quantity vs quality: “There is a difference between painting a back
fence and writing a poem, but only one of quantity. And there is, for
me, no difference between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight
against the body of a woman l love” (58).

I wonder --- is she saying that the pornographic has to do with
quantity -- of sensation without feeling, and that the erotic has to
do with quality -- depth of feeling? This question of quantity over
quality interests me because it relates to the digital, and digital
aesthetics. To the question of digitization. There’s the claim by
Kittler that the digital brings us to a new regime of aesthetics where
media is just numbers, what Kittler calls “eyewash,” as opposed to
analogue media like photography and phonography, which stores data as
physical effects or traces. From the first page of Media, Film,
Typewriter: The general digitization of channels and information
erases the differences among individual media. Sound and image, voice
and text are reduced to surface effects, known to consumers as
interface. Sense and the senses turn into eyewash.. Inside the
computers themselves everything becomes a number: quantity without
image, sound or voice. 1 The claim that digital media lacks
physicality has been countered by media/literary theorists like
N. Katherine Hayles and Matt Kirschenbaum, who explore the very
physical effects of digital media, in Kirschenbaum’s case, looking at
how traces on a hard drive, for example, are as sensual and unique as
any other physical objects, though they perpetuate an illusion of
immateriality.

The use of Lord’s “erotic,” emphasizing the role of chaos in creating
intimacy or new modes of connection---something I had read, this word
“chaos,” and didn’t know what to do with: “The erotic is a measure
between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our
strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which,
once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire” (54). This idea
that chaos can be a bridge of connection. Reminds me of Brown, and
also of Jackson, who talks about dissolving the boundaries of the self
as a way of forming new ethical connections (we’ve seen this in
Brown’s Black Utopias). This is very smart, and it’s in keeping with
structures of thought from black lesbian feminists.

     CLOSED: [2022-11-02 Wed 13:53]
identity. U of Minnesota Press, 2017.

Looking at the black flesh that has been used to denigrate as a tool
of empowerment. White race and gender has been constructed out of the
reduction of body to flesh. This flesh, which has undergone this
reduction, can be a place of possibility, of fugitivity, of escape,
for example, in the concept of the “transcapable”. This "pornotrope"
suggests a state of chaos which can resist the fixity of
gender.

The book examines the "mechanics of invention," or the ways that black
life has been defined by "state grammars" (xiv).

Terms: "'Trans' is more about a movement with no clear origin and no
point of arrival, and 'blackness' signifies upon an enveloping
environment and condition of possibility" (2).

Concepts that we have today of gender depend on the reduction of flesh
to captive bodies: "Captive and divided flesh functions as malleable
matter for mediating and remaking sex and gender as matters of human
categorization and personal definition" (20). 
- "Captive flesh expressed an ungendered position that defines race as
  the sine qua non of sex" (34).
- "On the one hand, white femininity is conferred in relation to an
  unwillingness to view white female genitalia, that is, to look upon
  white women as flesh. On the other hand, the unrelenting scopic
  availability that defined blackness within the visual economy of
  racial slavery becomes the necessary context for producing a field
  of sex/gender knowledge" (33). 

Methodology: "This black and trans historiographical project" relies
on what has been omitted from the archive as "conditions of
possibility" (11). "The archives under review here are all products of
invention. What is necessary, then, are theoretical and historical
trajectories that further imaginative capacities to construct more
livable black and trans worlds" (14).  

Method is to read into the details of the archival record:
- The /smell/ indexes both racial/class hierarchy and resistance. "The
  discourse of disgust registered Anarcha's stench with the conjoined
  necropolitial and biopolitical logics of slavery and medicine, yet
  the recurrent descriptors of Anarcha's body odor provides an opening
  to imagine what modicums of protection might have been afforded by
  smelling noxious to one's enslaver" (27). 
- The /medical assistance/ by slaves opens speculation into "modes of
  nourishment and care" they provided one another (29). 
   - "the opacity in the archive on this matter [Betsey's procedure]
     leaves room to imagine how Betsey might have somehow resisted the
     performance of stoic bravery or willing subjectivity that she was
     compelled to produce" (25).
- The /daguerrotype/ "offers a visual grammar for reading the
  imbrications of 'race' and 'gender' under captivity" (40). 
    - "That the image does not reside on the surface but floats in an
      unmappable elsewhere offers an allegory for race as a procedure
      that exceeds the logics of a bodily surface, occuring by way of

***** to read in between the contradictions - at the intersection of
race and gender. 

He picks apart the contradictions that produce race and gender. The
captive women Betsey, Lucy, and Anarcha and unnamed others enabled the
development of gynecology as a field while being simultaneously
disavowed as women. White femininity prevents the inspection of white
female genitalia, it is constructed out of the "scopic availability"
of black flesh (Snorton 33). Yet this genderless flesh is also a
"capacitating structure" which enables "fungibility for fugitive
movement" (Snorton 53). Additionally, while traditional racial
"passing" assumes white passing, it is blackness which gives one the
"gender indefiniteness" to enable "cross-gendered modes of escape"
(Snorton 56). For example, Snorton discusses the "blackening" of
Harriet Jacobs, the writer of /Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl/
(1861), as an escape strategy that s allowed her to obtain
"fungibility, thingness" to avoid recognition (Snorton 71). 

Answering to two arguments about the inevitability of Phillip DeVine's
death in the Brandon Teena murders, the first that his race was
irrelevant, and the second that it was a question of bad
timing. Snorton explains how the former argument demonstrates how
blackness as inconsequential becomes an excuse for violence, and the
second that, as a disabled black man, "DeVine's figuration [is] always
and already untimely, assigned to a conversation perpetually deferred"
from trans issues (Snorton 181).

methodology: inventing from the details of the archival record

DeVine's story, for example, "requires nothing short of invention"
(Snorton 183). 

In light of the "Say their names" imperatives from BLM and BTLM,
Snorton situates her project as part of an attempt to find new ways of
figuring black death, enumerating and naming black death, "a demand
for enw structures of naming that evince and evicerate the conditions
that continually produce black and trans death" (Snorton 195). 

Her method is to read into the details of the archival record....

in an antiblack world/. NYU Press, 2020.


There seems to be this move in Black/AfAm Studies that’s drawing on
newer ideas in Materialisms and the Philosophy of Science to overturn
ideas from the Enlightenment.

The ideas from contemporary science (plasticization, symbiosis) which
she takes and applies to her critique of Enlightenment. Dismantles
Enlightenment thought -- saying that blackness has not been “denied”
or “evacuated” but rather reappropriated, plasticized to suit liberal
humanist needs. What we think of as "Humanism" emerges from the
appropriation of black being and knowing. Human–animal dichotomies
inscribe, through their hierarchisation, violent orders.

This is essential, necessary work, and makes me think of feminist
scientists like Haraway (whom she cites) who began by critiquing
patriarchal approaches to empirical science (like the idea that
primate society is driven by competitions for dominance, rather than
collective cooperation). Also makes me think of New Materialist ideas
like Jane Bennett (whom she cites) who talk about consciousness being
something not only contained within the human or other beings but also
with objects. About the assemblage rather than the individual.

The ideas from Butler, which Jackson brings up, are key here. Butler
reimagines human subjectivity as not individual but collective,
arising from symbiosis between a variety of bodies and species. In
“Bloodchild,” Jacson reads “receptivity” rather than passivity. She
also claims that Butler doesn’t idealize symbiosis, but instead looks
at how conditions of unequal power can make it problematic.

     CLOSED: [2022-11-02 Wed 13:52]
Sexuality/desire cannot be severed from domination. The pornotrope
(from Hotense Spillers): severing the body from social network,
gender, etc. Makes the body just flesh. And also mysterious, and
desirable.

Excess is in the surface, a way of confounding subjectivity and
subject coherence.

Violence produces flesh. Violence produces an excess (like hunger in
Holiday) which it cannot incorporate. 

"In Origin of the Universe 1 Thomas places rhinestones where we might
expect to see shadows. They appear in the creases of sheets, to mark the
contours of flesh, to demarcate nipples, pubic hair, and labial folds. They
disrupt the flat planes of color with their raised and sparkling presence.
Instead of peeking inward, we are distracted by surface and ornamentation.
Rhinestones offer Thomas a palette beyond oils; they provide a way
to expand the surface of her paintings and to gesture toward epistemologies
not captured by realism" (49).


"surface as a formal strategy of producing opacity. This activation of
a surface aesthetic serves as a rejection of the mandate of
transparency, while also enabling alternate modes of apprehending
pleasure and selfhood. There are several layers to thinking Thomas’s
relation to surface. First, there is the question of size. Origin of
the Universe 1 is a large painting (sixty by forty-eight inches),
which invites the contemplation of surface as a spectacle. In this
way, I understand spectacle to be operating in opposition to the
pornographic or scientific gaze in that through its excess, it
disrupts the possibility of contained knowledge.  Additionally, the
nature of spectacle invites us into the specific realm of black
hypervisuality through Thomas’s use of the rhinestone and the
reflective dimensions of their shine. Instead of vagina as void, the
rhinestones emphasize the ways that this vulva’s materiality lies at
the center of two epistemologies of intimacy—friction and narcissism"
(48).

"Thinking the rhinestone as a trace or residue of Thomas’s wetness and
excitement allows us to hold violence, excess, and possibility in the
same frame. Even as the source is ambiguous, the idea that rhinestones
might offer a record of pleasure—-pleasure that is firmly constituted
in and of the flesh—-shows us a form of self-possession.  This self is
not outside of objectification, but its embellishment and insistence
on the trace of excitement speaks to the centrality of pleasure in
theorizations of self-love." (63).

Brown points out in Bulter the tension between what in our human
nature allows us to transcend our species and what prevents us from
doing so. Either humanity will “grow” or it will “prevail.

Brown is re-conceiving sensation and desire to transcend the bounded
subject.

Black subjects, being excluded from the ‘human’, have a mobility, an ‘untethered state’ (7). 

She asks, “Does the self need bounded wholeness in order to feel, or
can it thrive in the effluent?” (14). She zeroes in on the
potentiality of “flesh” in its reduction to avoid the markings of
subjectivity: “Flesh… is free of the need for subjectivity. I contend
that there is freedom in the flesh, in the moments when it is excluded
from being marked, as it feels, and responds to, touch”
(11). Sensation, desire, and flesh all reach toward a kind of merging.

The freedom in this reduction recalls snorton’s transcapable.

She creates a model for understanding the role of the flesh in
reconceiving the subject, which allows us to rethink agency and
consent. 

quotes:

**** Jennifer L. Morgan. /Reckoning with Slavery/. 

From [[https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/li_qipehreviews_reckoning_with_slavery/][review]]:

 "Over the course of six chapters, Reckoning with Slavery models a way
 of accounting for and filling in this archival silence, namely by
 reading references to gender and kinship “as a type of irruption”
 (p. 49). Attending to the canonical writings of the fifteenth-century
 Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Zurara, for instance, Morgan
 demonstrates how Zurara’s description of the grief of the enslaved
 reveals the damage that market forces wreak on networks of
 kinship. Similarly, in her analysis of a diagrammatic cross section
 of the crowded hold of a slave ship, she notes movingly that the
 easily missed image of an enslaved woman giving birth on board
 signals the horrors of children being viewed as commodities. Such a
 mode of reading reframes early colonial texts about slavery as
 implicit critiques of it and, in doing so, offers a way of
 interpreting narratives as counternarratives and a glimpse at the
 radical forms historical reconstruction can take. No longer is
 historical reconstruction merely about writing a more expansive
 history including the previously excluded voices of women and
 girls—itself a formidable task. It is also about rethinking the
 foundations of this history in terms of their movements and roles.

 What Reckoning with Slavery brings to literary-historical studies,
 then, is an archival practice that is at once historicist and
 reparative. On one hand, it is invested in interpreting a spotty
 historical record ethically, and this is shown in the book by Morgan
 as she brings together different archives to map a more accurate and
 comprehensive global history. That it leans so productively on
 Portuguese texts to chart a partial history of the slave trade in the
 English Americas is but one example. On the other hand, however, the
 book is also not bound by what is present in historical archives, and
 this is where it shines. Many of the stories of enslaved women might
 never be recovered, but Reckoning with Slavery shows how their
 stories might still be told by reading their silences creatively. The
 absence of women from the history of slave revolts, for instance,
 might not necessarily mean that they failed to participate in these
 uprisings or that they only participated in tiny, quotidian ways. It
 might also mean that their deeds were erased because women were so
 foundational to these uprisings that they inspired unease. Such a
 creative methodology paves the way for new, provocative historical
 narratives to be written."

**** Dereck Scott, Extravagant Abjection: “Slavery, Rape, and the
 Black Male Abject”

Analyzing abjection - “Even in the abject there is something with
which to work” (146).

“Or is it possible that there is a self-seeking in the act (especially
as the violating act becomes systematized, routinized), a subject
questing after its own forms of relief and, in so doing, questing
after the terms by which to know and to experience itself?” (162).

Toni Morrison reworks tropes of male emasculation into male rape,
while doing so both figures it as a possibility and surrounding it
with silence: “to figure both the possibility of sexual exploitation
of men and the silence surrounding this possibility” (132). It eludes
our access for a few reasons.

Representational strategy -- to shape a silence while breaking it… the
emptiness left by a boom or a cry”

Reminds me of William James’s idea about thought being continuous, a
“stream”, illustrated by the word: “Thunder-breaking-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it…. the feeling
of the thunder is also a feeling of the silence as just gone” (234).

 Language can work with and against this idea. It works against this
 idea by using discrete names for things, when everything is actually
 part of an ecosystem of interconnection, a continuous sensorium. But
 we can see this in syntactic structures, particularly in
 conjunctions, prepositions, and inflections of voice. James talks
 about how the stream of thought is continually moving from idea to
 idea, and there are moments of “flight” between the ideas, the
 “resting places.” In the moments of flight we can grasp the movement,
 but not completely: “Our experiences actually match the shadings and
 nuances of language, so we ‘ought to say a feeling of and, and a
 feeling of if, a feeling of but, and a feeling of by, quite as
 readily as we say a feeling of blue or a feeling of cold’ (The
 Principles of Psychology 378).”  “Rapid premonitory perspective views
 of schemes of thought not yet articulate” (245).  I’m thinking of
 language as a representational strategy, as a way to represent what
 is unrepresentable, à la Hartman. To tell an impossible story.

We don’t normally easily imagine the male submission, even though it’s
a repressed trauma--- “testeria”: the complicated relationship of
control and desire.

Joins feminist science studies with feminist and postcolonial theories
to explore how touch as a physical theoretical concept opens up an
queer ethical dimension. Touch is not direct contact, but it is
imbrication, involvement, with everything and especially with the
stranger. 

Purpose in part to "trouble the notion of touch as an innocent form of
engagement... toubling its positioning in the history of philosophy as
a mutually consenting act between individuals, free of culture,
history, and politics" (Barad, footnote 2, p. 153). 

To reframe physics as a study of touch /torques/ traditional
physics. Measurement as a form of touching, for example.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
In an important sense, touch is the primary concern of physics. Its
entire history can be understood as a struggle to articulate what
touch entails. How do particles sense one another? Through direct
contact, an ether, action-at-a-distance forces, fields, the exchange
of virtual particles? What does the exchange of energy entail? How is
a change in motion effected? What is pressure? What is temperature?
How does the eye see? How do lenses work? What are the different kinds
of forces that particles experience? How many kinds are there? What is
the nature of measurement?8 Once you start looking at it this way, you
get a dizzying feeling as things shift. This particular take on
physics, and its history, entails a torquing, a perturbation from the
usual storylines. 155
#+END_QUOTE

From a physics point of view, touch is "electromagnetic interaction"
(155). Does not involve actual touching, contact between two things,
but the repulsion, "electromagnetic repulsion," the force of repulsion
between electrons at the perimeters of atoms, which are negatively
charged, "cannot bear direct contact" (156). 
 
This "quantum theory of touching...." that "repulsion is at the core
of attraction... is radically queer" (156). 
- Quantum physics is queer in that electrons touch themselves when
  they're not supposed to. They release and reabsorb photons
  arbitrarily. They do not act in ways we expect them to.
- there are "an infinite set of possibilities involving every possible
  kind of interaction with every possible kind of virtual particle it
  can interact with" (158).
- "Hence, self-touching is an encounter with the infinite alterity of
  the self. Matter is an enfolding, an involution, it cannot help
  touching itself, and in this self-touching it comes in contact with
  the infinite alterity that it is." (158).
- "all of matter, matter in its “essence” (of course, that is
  precisely what is being troubled here), is a massive overlaying of
  perversities: an infinity of infinities" (159).

Physicists often work as if these infinities cancel each other
out. What Barad calls a process of "renormalization": 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Renormalisation is the mathematical handling/taming of these
infinities. That is, the infinities are “subtracted” from one another,
yielding a finite answer.18 Mathematically speaking, this is a tour de
force. Conceptually, it is a queer theorist’s delight. It shows that
all of matter, matter in its “essence” (of course, that is precisely
what is being troubled here), is a massive overlaying of perversities:
an infinity of infinities. 159
#+END_QUOTE

Touch is touching the strange, the inhuman. It is a connection with
everything:
-  "All touching entails an infinite alterity, so that touching the
  other is touching all others, including the “self,” and touching the
  “self” entails touching the strangers within" (160).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
what would it mean to acknowledge that responsibility extends to the
insensible as well as the sensible, and that we are always already
opened up to the other from the “inside” as well as the “outside”? How
might we come in contact with or least touch upon an ethics that is
alive to the virtual? This would seem to require, at the very least,
being in touch with the infinite in/determinacy at the heart of
matter, the abundance of nothingness, the infinitude of the void and
its in/determinate murmurings, the muted cries, and silence that
speaks of the possibilities of justice-to-come.
#+END_QUOTE

The "inhuman... may be the very condition of possibility of feeling
the suffering of the other, of literally being in touch with the
other, of feeling the exchange of e-motion in the binding obligations
of entanglements" (164).

Like Kirschenbaum, works to demystify the "trope of immateriality"
that governs theorizing around digital media (1044). 

Bits are both logical and material and create real constraints on
computing systems. There is a trade-off between two opposing forces:
abstraction (modularity and layering) and computing efficiency. We
create higher order structures (like programming languages) so that we
can work better with them, but this higher order requires more
computational power. Like python, which needs a compiler to run, as
opppsed to C++ or Assembly.
- "in abstracting from the noise that different materials bring to the
  digital abstraction, from specific implementations of physical
  resources, from their distribution in space, and from their sharing
  among multiple users, such decoupling necessarily involve efficiency
  trade-offs."  (1054).
- "This is the classical dilemma of high-level programming languages:
  the more a language’s constructs abstract away from the underlying
  physical machine, the less efficient the resulting code tends to be"
  (1046).

cites Hayles on her study of how information lost its body. 

cites Kirschenbaum (and figures in the field of descriptive
bibliography) as one of the first to delve into the material history
of computation: "The task then is to map how the particular material
condition of electronic media makes possible or impossible new
potentialities for reading" (1044).
- Kirschenbaum has two things to say about "formal
  materiality". First, the point on "how computers’ ability to
  continually perform error-correction enables them to present digital
  information as 'noiseless,'" the second "points to file formats and
  the structuration they impose on digital data as powerful
  constraints on mutability of bits—-for example, in the case of JPEG
  images, different levels of compression result in images
  perceptually indistinguishable, but from which some information has
  been irretrievably lost" (1045).

- When did information lose its body, and how is this tied to the
  liberalization of the human subject?
- Hayles is concerned that scientific discourses about technology
  overlook the role of the body and embodiment in thinking. She wants
  to bring back feeling. Thought needs a body.
    - The Turing test, for example, indicates one place where humans
      conceive of informaiton (or intelligence) as separate from
      embodiment. The inclusion of gender in the test suggests that
      the question is about represented, rather than enacted,
      intelligence. The assumptions behind this test suggest that we
      are already posthuman.
    - The concept of the Posthuman extends assumptions from liberal
      humanism: rationality is prioritized, the head controls the
      body. A rational mind that possesses a body becomes intelligence
      (information) that inhabits a body or container.
- She examines the waves of cybernetic development, in particular the
  Macy conferences where scientists and philosophers discussed
  development of information and communication theory. Throughout
  these waves of cybernetic development, from homeostasis (the body is
  a regulating system), to reflexivity (the observer is part of the
  system), and virtuality (information makes information, emergence),
  Hayles finds that the body becomes more and more displaced.
- Hayles's idea of flickering signifiers show how inscription and
  materiality are further elided. What happens to words when we see
  them as constantly refreshed and moveable on a screen? They attain
  a fluidity and volatility that goes beyond the floating signifier,
  beyond semiotics. This flickering wouldn't be possible if they were
  in hard copy.

- Remediation --- the idea that media is re-conceived or re-written
  for electronic formats. The “recycling” of different media formats
  through electronic media (Bolter and Grusin).
- Technotexts are literary works that self-reflexively engage with
  their own inscription practices. They explore how many levels of
  text entwine with bodies, a distributed cognitive environment in
  which reading takes place.
- How mediation affects subjectivity, how the interaction between
  physical and verbal forms construct meaning and therefore, the
  user/reader.
- In *House of Leaves*, the remediated narrator evacuates
  consciousness as the source of production and replaces it with
  mediated subjectivities. “Consciousness is no longer the relevant
  frame but rather consciousness fused with technologies of
  inscription” (116-117).

**** TODO Hayles, Katherine N. *Cognitive Unconscious*, 2017. 
- Hayles proposes a "planetary cognitive ecology" extends the focus of
  ethical inquiry from humans to machines that operate with humans
  within larger "cognitive assemblages." Distinguishes cognition by
  interpretation or choice, rather than free will. This allows her to
  include machines in discussions about ethics.
- Cognition involves more than what we consciously recognize, and more
  than the unconscious. It is "unthought", or thinking without
  thinking, being in the eternal present and eluding the belated grasp
  of consciousness.
    - There are three layers to consciousness: higher consciousness
      (abstraction), nonconscious cognition (interpretation and
      choice), material processes (storms). Nonconscious cognition is
      inaccessible to our awareness, like neuronal processing,
      synthesizing sensory inputs so they appear consistent across
      time and space, finding patterns in chaos, keeping our
      consciousness from being overwhelmed.  --> there are N
      Dimensions for reading a page.
- Our cognition also operates with other technical systems to form
  "cognitive assemblages"---human technical interactions that operate
  collectively, in automated technical systems, for example. Often
  consist of low level processors or sensors which are connected to
  higher level processors that draw inferences or take actions /
  decisions. Like the traffic control in LA.

     Bloomsbury Handbook to Octavia Butler. pp. 95-115.

Butler's posthumanism incorporates difference to imagine "diverse
embodiments" (Dunkley 96).

***** intevention on Posthumanism:

/Dawn/'s posthumanism revises the anthropocentric and patriarchal
hegemony of humanism. The key difference for this kind of posthumanism
is a craving to integrate and accumulate difference, rather than
define themselves against it.

  "Lilith’s Brood prompts us to question how our relationships and sense
  of kinship with the racialized, sexualized, and naturalized Other
  might look, if, like the Oankali, we chose to 'embrace difference'
  (Adulthood Rites 329); might we, as a result, now recognize the Other
  within us?" (Dunkley 113-114).

  "Humanism functions on the apotheosis of the anthropos and a belief in
  its inherent worth, autonomy, rationality, and capabilities—-qualities
  intended to affirm our status at the pinnacle of the Cartesian
  hierarchy, above animals, machines, and the Other" (Dunkley 97).

***** on Fear: 

  "Oankali are ostensibly constructed so as to invert our Humanistic
  egocentrism—-not only is difference not considered the source of fear
  for the Oankali, but they are physiologically engineered to hunger for
  it" (Dunkley 96).

  "In fact, the ontological danger that the ooloi pose to the system of
  Humanism is most acutely felt by the men, for whom the ooloi come to
  represent rival figures... threaten to usurp the men’s position at the
  pinnacle of a gendered hierarchy, usurpation that is especially
  calamitous given the ooloi’s role as sexual penetrator—-an
  ideologically loaded function, connoting uniquely masculine traits of
  power, virility, and strength" (Dunkley 100).

What makes the Oankali interesting as colonizers is that they of the
traits of colonizers without easily being branded as oppressive or
British colonizers. What Butler achieves, then, is a situation in

administratively coercive, inegalitarian of "domestic trysts" (as
opposed to "domestic bliss") even when its motives are genuine (Nanda,

resolves as two opposing theories: afro-pessimism (refuses ontological
possibility of blackness) and afrofuturism (radical world-making).

"pessimistic futurism" mobilizes the historic markers of blackness to
unsettle and destabilize the arrangements of power in the present and
to try to think beyond those arrangements in the future" (Mann 66).

desire, which "has been too long relegated to the realm of sexuality"
(Belk 376).

using essence strategically. 

***** cyborg feminism
Draws from Haraway's cyborg: "'cyborg identity' reconceives identity
(a static and fixed essense) as /position/ (within a particular
history, narrative, ideology, and/or social system" (Ramirez 384).

Identification through shared difference: 
- Draws from Chela Sandoval's "US Third World Feminism", the idea of
  "differential consciousness" -- "a /tactical subjectivity/ with the
  capacity to recenter depending upon the kinds of oppression to be
  confronted" (rpt. Sandoval 1991,14, italics in original; Ramirez
  384).
- For example, "the term "woman of color" forges links between women
  from distant and disparate locations (both geographic and
  socioeconomic) by positioning them—and recognizing that they have
  been positioned—within particular histories of exclusion, oppression
  and resistance" (Ramirez 384). 

The body: "the body is simultaneously material and discursive. Our
conceptions and experiences of it as material are always socially
mediated" (Ramirez 387). 

***** strategic essense
Essence is something that is used strategically in order to claim
validity and rights; rather than to denigrate. 

"Butler and Anzaldua deploy essence by emphasizing a particular social
or subject position (e.g., Butler always identifies the race,
ethnicity, and gender of her characters and Anzaldua stresses
"homosexuality" in delineating a global, queer community)."

"The tension between affinity and essence, and between plurality and
specificity in the work of Anzaldua and Butler, highlights a
contradiction of woman-of-color subjectivity and feminism: The
histories of racism, imperialism, patriarchy, and homophobia have
rendered women of color abject, yet, via history, women of color must
claim some sort of position in order transform themselves into
(speaking) subjects (without replicat ing the regime [s] that silenced
them)" (Ramirez 395-396)

Butler exhibits a "biological essentialism" when it comes to sex and
sex traits which enhaces her feminist politics. 

***** biolgoical essensialist sex
Asks how Butler can be a femininist if she's drawing from
essentialized notions of sex?: "what kind of feminism does a
biologically informed notion make possible?" (Jesser 37).
- "Genetics is the science of Butler's fiction. The translation of
  genotype to phenotype is the plot" (Jesser 52).

She de-constructs race, shows it as a construct, while reinforcing
the genetic facts that underpin behaviorial tendencies and
predispositions, like hierarchy, aggression (male) and relational,
nurturing (female).  
- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "Difference matters in Butler, but racial difference matters
  differently than sexual difference, which makes possible future
  generations... it is fair to say that Butler is 'constructivist,' when
  relating to racial identities; however, when relating to sex/gender
  her female characters are often, biologically coded as female--that
  is, devoted to self-sacrifice in the name of nurturing at one's own
  expense and the urging of maternal instincts" (Jesser 38).
  #+END_QUOTE 
- The women and men reinforce sexual differences. (Jesser 42-43),
  males being more hierarchical (Jesser 44).
- "the plot relentlessly reinforces certain sociobiological notions of
  essential and 'natural' male and female through the concept of
  biological 'tendency'" (Jesser 41-42).

This emphasis on biology is feminist, proposing female biological
traits as those which will enable humanity to expand beyond its
destructive tendencies, exemplified by the male aggression, dominance
and possessiveness.  
- Example with rape being "both natural and avoidable... human nature
  proves flexible, but only with serious forms of social and
  biological intervention" (Jesser 43).
- "The way out is through a narrative of biological extra-individual
  drives; the ability/need to see beyond individual survival to
  survival of one's kin" (Jesser 40)
- "a vision of bodies that are often bad for us. At least as far as
  sex and sexuality go. Butler's bodies have a will of their own, and
  it is to be found most often lodged in genetic "tendencies" if not
  fixities" (Jesser 45). 
- Women's "connections to their bodies are more than a form of
  bondage... In place of the enslaved female body, Butler imagines a
  powerful, emancipating intersubjective body in which the social
  bosom and the maternal bosom are newly coherent" (Jesser 56).

"this paper traces how Butler explores a specifically erotic pleasure
that is integral for such a shift in subjectivity to begin, in the
process arguing that Butler's work explores not just a new communal
ethics, but new individual pleasures as well" (Ackerman 25). 

"While Lilith may love and desire her Oankali mates, she also is
painfully aware of how that desire and love causes losses as well as
gains. Desire is inextricably linked with and implicated in power,
both for those desiring and those desired" (Ackerman 40). 

"The Oankali in the narrative, with their ability to perceive and
manipulate genes, certainly view human genetics as fundamentally and
essentially flawed" (Ackerman 32). 


"What the trilogy does not present as so surmountable, however, is a
heteronormative standard" (Ackerman 39).

"heterosexuality does read as the standard, or even, only erotic
option available" (Ackerman 40).

"Nancy Jesser's point that "the sexual biology in Butler's story is
remarkably fixed" is an important one (3 7); even if the standard
number is now three rather than two, the narrative never presents an
erotic scene with an ooloi and two individuals of the same sex/gender"
(Ackerman 40). 

**** TODO Patricia Meltzer, /Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and
Feminist Thought/. Austin: U of Texas P, 2006. 

pages 236, 238-241.

Genderqueer reading of gender in Xenogenesis, based off the construct
ooloi in the third book which shift bodies according to desires of
their partner. Draws from Butler's concept of gender as performance,
an act, which reenacts heteronormative assumptions. Butler creates a
"queer essence" of identity based on desire (Meltzer 238). 

There are distruptions to normativity, like in liberal feminism where
the binary is destabilized, upended, where gender roles are
reimagined. And then there are alternate visions for sex/gender/desire
altogether. Queerness is resisting the normative correlation of
sex/gender/desire, with an emphasis on identity, according to
Butler. Butler says that there is not inner "self" of gender or any
identity, that it is produced discursively. It is produced through
performativity, which is melancholic in that a subject desires a
gender which it can never inhabit. This failure is what opens up the
possibility of imagining otherwise. That identification and desire can
coexist, that desire can precede identification, is queer, according
to Butler in "Imitation and Gender Insubordination", which is mirrored
in the construct ooloi (Meltzer 237). 

"genderqueer" is not about neutrality or blending. It is about
"placing masculine and feminine into contradictory relationships with
each other" (Meltzer 227). It "poses a challenge to the gender binary
without necessarily erasing sexual difference as the source of erotic
pleasure" (Melzter 227).

In /Imago/, Butler "explores the notion of the body as constructed by
desire" (Meltzer 228). 

"Butler's concepts here are positioned neither in a biological
essentialism that insists on gender identity (woman) as derivated of a
body's sex (female), nor in a social and/or psychological
constructivism that udnerstands the body's materiality as dominated by
(social) discourse. Instead, desire and sexuality are based in the
body's need for others... the body follows desire" (Meltzer 241). 

On sex: 
- "the exchange is physical but mediated" (Melzter 236). 
- "The lack of physical genitals as indicators of this sexual practice
renders Oankali-human sex impossible to classify in terms of sexual
identities. It is even impossible to separate the 'act' from 'fantasy'
since partners never actually touch, yet they share intense sexual
experiences through parallel stimulation of brains" (Melzter 236).
- "Desire, then, is... rooted in the body's amorphous craving for
physical pleasure" (Melzter 236).

Consent in the novel is hardly discussed; the Oankali compel desire in
a way that troubles consent. Difference between pheromones released by
humans (which is involuntary) verus releasing them as a deliberate
act. (115-116). 
- "Humans may release pheramones involuntarily; with Oankali, it is a
  conscious, deliberate act" (Burnett 116).
- Joseph was raped (Burnett 116). 

Disturbed by the depiction, which he links to slavery:
- On the episode with Paul Titus, the Oankali "strongly mirror slave
  owners, pairing off their slaves without consent or consultation,
  and not giving a second thought to their slaves' right to consent or
  refuse" (Burnett 113).

Says the point is to see need for consent. 
- "We might read /Dawn/ as a parable for the need for affirmative
  consent in sexual encounters, particularly ones which transcend
  barriers or break taboos" (Burnett 118).

About primatology and where primates sit on the human-animal

status? On the "techno-bio-politics of difference" (Haraway
376). Haraway reads /Dawn/ "as if it were a report from the primate
field in the allotopic space of earth after a nuclear holocaust"
(376). 

"Gender is kind, syntax, relation, genre; gender is not the
transubstantiation of biological sexual difference" (Haraway 377). 

Use of the word 'monster' to describe the aliens: 
- "Her fiction, especially in Xenogenesis, is about the monstrous fear
  and hope that the child will not, after all, be like the
  parent. There is never just one parent. Monsters share more than the
  word's root with the verb "to demonstrate"; monsters signify"
  (Haraway 378).

While Butler disrupts social and sexual assumptions, the boundaries of
species and sex, she does not disrupt heterosexuality:
- "Heterosexuality remains unquestioned, if more complexly
  mediated. The different social subjects, the different genders that
  could emerge from another embodiment of resistance to compulsory
  heterosexual reproductive politics, do not inhabit this Dawn. In
  this critical sense, Dawn fails in its promise to tell another
  story, about another birth, a xenogenesis. Too much of the sacred
  image of the same is left intact" (Haraway 380).

** revisions
*** first half october 2022
**** overview of alien and flesh sections:
The "aliens" section examines human vs Oankali social structures to
read the role of sensuality and feeling in their relationships and
ethics. The Oankali offer a model of ethics based on feeling, rather
than choice or consent. They achieve this model by bypassing the
organ, the flesh, in favor of direct neural connection.

It then turns to the flesh, to examine how it can be redeployed
through the very reduction to materiality that causes problems.

We begin by taking a deeper look at the human contradiction and
racialization. 
- Reconstructing the simile: Chicana theory of fear of similarity
  enabled by the human contradiction.
- Drive to put things in a hierarhcy, use intelligence to do so. 

Oankali social structure bases social relations on pleasure; allows
them to bypass barrier of fear. 
- The bypassing of flesh bypasses consent, prioritizes pleasure
- Crucially, it also scrambles traditional distinctions between
  thought and feeling. Boundaries become permeable.

How can black femininst studies help us to read the flesh, then?

For humans, the flesh is a problem, a barrier to more pleasurable
forms of social organization. Black feminists help us to see how the
Flesh can be redeployed. 
- The emphasis on the surface finds fugitivity, foreclosure.

The aliens give us a social problem, fixed with a physiological
solution. It involves bypassing the flesh. Once we are in this place,
our distinctions between sense and thought dissolve. Consent becomes
mutual feeling. 

The black feminists give us a method of reading resistance into the
flesh. 

We then move this redeployment from the physiological to the
technological.

*** Media Archaeology 

**** Flesh enables re-formulation (queer form)
Looking at racialization and the flesh reveals strategies of reading
of the flesh rooted in its *materiality*. In possibilities contained
within the reduction to the physical. It leads to a *re-formulation*
for understanding the interaction between the material and the
symbolic in media.

**** Media Archaeology overview

Kittler vs Kirschenbaum 
- Media is undifferentiated, immaterial (Kittler) vs media is durable,
  particular (Kirschenbaum). Kirschenbaum wants to unflatten the 0s
  and 1s.
- Kirschenbaum's registers: Forensic vs Formal levels.
- Engaging with media always implies displacement. Oral history
  quote. 
- Hansen and perceptual extensibility. 
- There is always a quality of inaccessibility, of remove, what we
  might call opacity.
- The torque of switching between. The shifting between different
  layers, abstractions.
- The vulnerability - being open to feeling/chaos that dissolves
  boundaries (unsure how this relates to media). 

*** the flesh
**** methodology: flipping the reductions
***** queer form
Taking what has been reduced as a tool for strategic opacity. 

When it comes to black bodies, the method of reduction has been
pornotroping, or /reducing the body to flesh/ (see Spillers, Snorton,
Musser). The reduction to flesh is what enables violence.

When it comes to technology, what is the method of reduction? It a
method of /abstracting the physical computational processes/,
displacing the physical operations of the CPU, memory, and hard drives
to screens (Kirschenbaum). So the flesh, unexpectedly, is /formal/
(not physical) materiality, what we see on the screen. The
computational processes have been reduced to these screen effects,
which we perceive as being disconnected from a body, from the
hardware. Flesh is a surface.

**** positionality and politics
How to theorize from black flesh but not instrumentalize it, not
diminish the real violences and suffering of black people. What are
ways of theorizing with blackness without perpetuating its
exploitation?

It's about a method of thinking at the intersection of two
registers. The story of the black flesh helps us to understand how
race was constructed for the purpose of oppression and
hierarchization. This can be applied to technology, to allow us to
rethink and relearn the way we use technology toward more equitable
ends. The current discourse of technology tends toward neoliberal
notions of productivity, monetization, privatization. Knowing the
discourse and how it works to conceal itself. Knowing how to
deconstruct and to build. To start over, like in /Dawn/.

What women of color have been thinking and writing about for decades,
is only just now reaching the attention of mainstream feminism. 

To think of the surface effects of computation as a way of thinking
about the physical realm. To bring the body back to the
flesh. Considering the flesh as a formal phenomenon made from a
physical reality. Being at the intersection of the digital and the
analog, the intersection of two registers, will open up the kind of
thinking we can do. This is the kind of thinking we will need to, in
Anzaldua's words, "see from both sides at once". This is about
capacious thinking.

**** Black Feminist Thinking and New Materialisms
Writers in Black Studies have been revising New Materialisms, reorient
discussions on materiality away from white masculinist perspectives
and celebrating a lineage of marginalized thinkers
***** The Pornotrope

The pornotrope suggests a state of chaos which can resist the fixity
of gender.

***** Pornotrope vs Pornographic: Snorton v. Lorde
There seems to be a misalignment between the pornographic in Lorde and
the pornotropic in Snorton/Musser. 

- The pornographic (Lorde) supresses feeling, pursuing only sensation,
  which opposes the erotic, which is "a measure between the beginnings
  of our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings" (54).

- Flesh (Snorton) is supposed to be this thing which eludes capture,
  but at the same time creates possibility. Snorton seems to suggest
  that we can get at resistance through the reduction to flesh, in the
  concept of the “transcapable”. That the pornotrope suggests a state
  of chaos which can resist the fixity of gender.

If the pornographic is just flesh, just pure sensation, we might build
an erotics from it. The reduction to flesh might represent potential
for depth of feeling. /Looking at the flesh for it’s erotic potential/
rather than the pornographic which is imposed upon it.

***** The Flesh and Subjectivity/Desire by Brown, Musser, Snorton
According to Hortense Spillers, the black body, by the violences in
the middle passage, has undergone a reduction to flesh.

This reduction to flesh, for Snorton, Musser, (Brown, Jackson?), opens
a space of possibility.  

For Snorton, Black flesh, as a reduction, can be a place of
possibility. An opportunity to read the details. 

For Musser, flesh is produced by violence. Violence produces an excess
(like hunger in Holiday) which it cannot incorporate. Sexuality/desire
cannot be severed from domination. According to Musser, it seems that
some kind of violence---the violence of marking the
subject/object---is necessary in the experience of flesh and
pleasure. “To think with the flesh and to inhabit the pornotrope is to
hold violence and possibility in the same frame” (Musser 12).

For Jackson, Blackness is plasticized at the service of violent
hierarchies of domination, such as "dehumanization" of blackness.

For Morgan and Johnson, looking at the structure of the thing to find
possibilities for resistance, for freedom and intimacy in the archive.

And additionally, that there is this contradiction (or paradox?)
within desire, which is between possession and dissolution---desire is
about a sovereign subject attempting to possess another, this is the
drive or impulse of desire; but at the same time, at the height of
desire, its ultimate goal, is about dissolution, about the melting
away of the subject. What if we reconceptualize desire as the impulse
to possess or dissolve, but without a subject?

***** Embodied and extended cognition
Folks from afam studies, like Jackson and Brown, are reconceptualizing
the human to go beyond the confines of the body, into ecology,
environment, via affective registers. 

Flesh, for Musser, can represent a state of freedom of connection, at
the same time that it is a sign of objectification: “Flesh… is free of
the need for subjectivity. I contend that there is freedom in the
flesh, in the moments when it is excluded from being marked, as it
feels, and responds to, touch” (Brown 11).

Connect to Hayles's work (?)

***** Flesh and absence: what is formally not representable 

There are two ideas: 
- Flesh as a site of possibility (see above) - what the reduction
  opens up.
- Flesh as an indicator of what is not representable (Scott).

Scott's /Extravagant Abjection/:

To feel what is not there -- to shape a silence. To find form in
apparent formlessness (with the help of James). 

Potential connection to media archaeology: the way that the immaterial
level (what we cannot see or touch) influences the formal level. How
the immaterial enables a continuous sensorium, an ecosystem of
interconnection. 

*** formal materiality
We need an attention to materiality that allows us to trace formal
materiality up the stack and in surface effects. 
- Hayles and Kirschenbaum enable us to deconstruct how what we think
  is immaterial is actually embodied/inscripted. 
- First, to understand, as Hayles explains, that "information loses
  its body" and see how this perpetuates liberal humanist reductions
  of the subject. Hayles frames this within a discussion of the
  posthuman.
- Second, to examine K's concept of formal formal materiality, where
  abstraction engages manipulation and sensuality, the shifting of
  registers. 
- K's torque enables us to read sensuality into Hayles's concept of
  flickering signifiers.

**** Hayles
Hayles on the feminist perspective of technological materiality,
bringing the body into technology. 
 
***** how information lost its body (/Posthuman/). 
- information "losing its body" is tied to liberal humanist
  ideology which imposes dominance systems for subjugating
  embodied difference. 
- throughout cybernetic development, the body becomes more and
  more displaced. Liberal humanism (natural self) ->  Posthumanism
  (cyborg/cybernetic). Rational mind possessing a body ->
  intelligence in informational patterns, inhabiting a body. Free
  will & agency -> cannot distinguish one will from another.

A dialectic of information as "pattern/randomness" is taking over, or
working in tandem with, "absence/presence" to dominate cultural views
about informatics and technology. 

"I believe that our best hope is to intervene constructively in this
development is to put an interpretive spin on it that opens up the
possibilities of seeing pattern and presence as complimentary rather
than antagonistic. Information, like humaninity, cannot exist apart
from embodiment that brings it into being as a material entity in the
world; and embodiment is always instantiated, local, and specific"
("Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers", 1993, 91).

***** flickering signifiers elide materiality 
The privileging of pattern/randomness over presence/absence in
contemporary sci fi and scientific conceptions of
intelligence/information leads to a systematic *devaluation of
materiality and embodiment* ("Virtual Bodies and Flickering
Signifiers", 1993, 91). Information becomes a series of codes
interspersed with randomness/mutations, rather than something that is
present or absent.

- Posthumanist conceptions extend poststructuralist ideas about
  signification. 
    - "Carrying the instabilities implicit in Lacanian floating
      signifiers one step further, information technologies create
      what I will call /flickering signifiers/, characterized by their
      tendency toward unexpected metamorphoses, attenuations, and
      dispersions" ("Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers", 1993,
      76).

    - Derrida, announcing the advent of grammatology, focused on the
      gap that separates speaking from writing; such a change
      transforms the narrator from speaker to scribe, or more
      precisely an absence toward which the inscriptions
      point. Informatics pushes this transformation further. As
      writing yields to flickering signifiers underwritten by binary
      digits, the narrator becomes not so much a scribe as a cyborg
      authorized to access the relevant codes" ("Virtual Bodies and
      Flickering Signifiers", 1993, 87). 

    - "When a text presents itself as a constantly refreshed image
      rather than durable inscription, transformations would occur
      that would be unthinkable if matter or energy, rather than
      informational patterns, formed the primary basis for the
      systemic exchanges. This textual fluidity, which humans learn in
      their bodies as they interact with the system, imply that
      signifiers flicker rather than float" (30). 

    - "In informatics the signifier can no longer be understood as a
      single marker, for example an ink mark on a page. Rather it
      exists as a flexible chain of markers bound together by the
      arbitrary relations specified by the relevant codes. As I write
      these words on my computer, I see the lights on the video
      screen, but for the computer the relevant signifiers are
      magnetic tracks on disks. Intervening between what I see and
      what the computer reads are the machine code that correlates
      alphanumeric symbols with binary digits, the compiler language
      that correlates these symbols with higher-level instructions
      determining how the symbols are to be manipulated, the
      processing program that mediates between these instructions and
      the commands I give the computer, and so forth. A signifier on
      one level becomes a signified on the next higher
      level. Precisely because the relation between signifier and
      signified at each of these levels is arbitrary, it can be
      changed with a single global command" ("Virtual Bodies and
      Flickering Signifiers", 1993, 77).

    - "/Patchwork Girl/ demonstrates that despite such important
      critical developments as deconstruction and Lacanian theory, we
      continue to operate from assumptions that are grounded in print
      technologies and that become problematic in the context of
      digital media. Why do we talk and write incessantly about the
      'text,' a term that obscures differences between technologies of
      production and implicitly promotes the work as an immaterial
      construct? Why do we continue to talk about the signifier as if
      it were a flat mark with no internal structure, when the coding
      chains of the digital computer operate in a completely different
      fashion? Why do our discussions of reading and writing largely
      focus on the author and reader, ignoring the cognitively
      sophisticated actions of intelligent machines that are active
      participants in the construction of meaning?" ("Flickering
      connectivities in Shelley Jackson's Patchwork Girl: the
      Importance of Media-Specific Analysis," 2000, par. 57)

***** reading "technotexts" to resist immaterialization
- "technotexts" - "literary works that self-reflexively engage with
  their own inscription technologies and integrate semiotic elements
  such as kineticism and navigational structures", "mobilizing
  reflexive loops between its imaginative world and the material
  apparatus embodying that creation as a fictional presence" (25).
  How digital levels of texts entwine with bodies, creating
  "distributed cognitive environment".
- "the materiality of inscription thoroughly interpenetrates the
  represented world" (Hayles /Writing/ 131).
- REMEDIATED NARRATOR: "a literary invention foregrounding a
  proliferation of inscription technologies that evacuate
  consciousness as the source of production and recover in its place a
  mediated subjectivity that cannot be conceived as an independent
  entity (116-117)
- MINDBODY: "When the simulated environment takes literary and
  narrative form, potent possibilities arise for reflexive loops that
  present the user with an imaginative fictional world while
  simultaneously engaging her with a range of sensory inputs that
  structure bodily interactions to reinforce, resist, or otherwise
  interact with the cognitive creation of the imagined world. The
  MINDBODY is engaged, not merely mind or body alone" (48).
- ILLEGIBILITY: in /Lexia to Perplexia/, moves toward a creole devised
  from the merging of English with programming code.
    - illegibility "reminds us that the computer is also a writer, and
      moreover a writer whose operations we cannot wholly grasp in all
      their semiotic complexity. Illegibility is not simply a lack of
      meaning, then, but a signifier of distributed cognitive
      processes that construct reading as an active production of a
      cybernetic circuit and not merely as an internal activity of the
      human mind" (51).
    - "the occluded display signifies a trajectory in which we become
      part of a cybernetic circuit. Interpolated into the circuit, we
      metamorphose from individual interiorized subjectivities to
      actors exercising agency within the extended cognitive systems
      that include non-human actors." (51)

***** material cognition, interpretation & choice --> decision trees
- Distinguishes cognition by interpretation or choice, rather than
  free will. This allows her to include machines in discussions about
  ethics.
- Cognition involves more than what we consciously recognize, and more
  than the unconscious. It is "unthought", or thinking without
  thinking, being in the eternal present and eluding the belated grasp
  of consciousness.
    - There are three layers to consciousness: higher consciousness
      (abstraction), nonconscious cognition (interpretation and
      choice), material processes (storms). Nonconscious cognition is
      inaccessible to our awareness, like neuronal processing,
      synthesizing sensory inputs so they appear consistent across
      time and space, finding patterns in chaos, keeping our
      consciousness from being overwhelmed.  --> there are N
      Dimensions for reading a page.
- Hayles proposes a "planetary cognitive ecology" extends the focus of
  ethical inquiry from humans to machines that operate with humans
  within larger "cognitive assemblages." Human technical interactions
  that operate collectively, in automated technical systems, for
  example. Often consist of low level processors or sensors which are
  connected to higher level processors that draw inferences or take
  actions / decisions. Like the traffic control in LA.

- how all systems contain unconscious thought
    - Could Hayles's thinking about the levels of cognition offer us
      an insight into thinking about the sexual interface in /Dawn/?
      There are levels where we are conscious, and there are levels of
      unconscious. Could these then be mapped to levels of materiality
      in digital media?

***** turing test (like performativity) presents gender as formal construction

- "the enacted and represented bodies are brought into conjunction
  through the technology that connects them. If you distinguish
  correctly which is the man and which the woman, you in effect reunite
  the enacted and the represented bodies into a single gender
  identity. The very existence of the text, however, implies that you
  might also make the wrong choice. Thus the test functions to create
  the possibility of a disjunction between the enacted and represented
  bodies, regardless of the choice you make. What the Turing test
  "proves" is that the overlay between the enacted and represented
  bodies is no longer a natural inevitability but a contingent
  production, mediated by a technology that has become so entwined with
  the production of identity that it can no longer meaningfully be
  separated from the human subject" (/Posthuman/ xiii).
- "the test puts you into a cybernetic circuit that splices your will,
  desire, and perception into a distributed cognitive system in which
  represented bodies are joined with enacted bodies through mutating
  and flexible machine interfaces" (/Posthuman/ xiv).

But the imitation game isn't about proving who or what can think. It's
about proving that intelligence can be performed. Turing doesn't erase
embodiment, he avoids it. He purposefully made the test to gauge
performance, representation, because he admits that it's easier than
establishing criteria for genuine intelligence. The "imitation game"
is precisely about proving that performance can simulate the real
thing, perhaps at some level, that performance /is/ the real
thing. Which is what Butler argues with Gender Performativity, the
inaugural moment of queer studies.

*** resisting violence in the archive: Snorton, Hartman
For his "black and trans historiographical project," Snorton
demonstrates flesh as the physical and malleable material that enables
the construction of social categories like race and gender. Similar to
scholars of slavery's archive like Saidiya Hartman, Snorton's method
takes the details of the archival record as "conditions of
possibility" in his study, and reads for hints of resistance contained
within the dominant narrative that suggest the ommitted, obscured, or
elided experience of black subjects (Snorton 11). This methodology
uses the critical imagination to read into what Hartman and others
call "the violence of the archive," a violence not only in the form of
evidence, that the records literally obscure or overlook information,
but also in the tools of expression, in the language that cannot
approximate experience, and in the discourse that dictates silence
(2). Like "Critical fabulation," Snorton's reading of archival
material draws narrative from the gaps and lacunae of the evidence,
working to "expose and exploit the incommensurability between the
experience of the enslaved and the fictions of history" (Hartman
10). One example concerns a slave woman, Anarcha, whose severe case of
Vaginal Fistula made her an object of medical experimentation. Because
the record that hardly mentions her by name (when it does not misname
her) is silent about her experience of what certainly were painful and
prolonged surgeries without anesthetics, Snorton turns to seemingly
minor details like smell and the presence of other enslaved women to
"further imaginative capacities" for reading resistance
(14). Anarcha's reportedly offensive smell, what Snorton calls the
"discourse of disgust," for example, indexes both her subjection to
social hierarchy and her resistance, for "the recurrent descriptors of
Anarcha's body odor provides an opening to imagine what modicums of
protection might have been afforded by smelling noxious to one's
enslaver" (27). Additionally, the banal reality of servitude implies
that other slave women such as Lucy and Betsey (among others who were
unnamed), stood as medical assitants when necessary, which opens
speculation into "modes of nourishment and care" they provided one
another (Snorton 29); In one procedure on Betsey, for example, Snorton
explains that "the opacity in the archive... leaves room to imagine
how Betsey might have somehow resisted the performance of stoic
bravery or willing subjectivity that she was compelled to produce"
(25).
