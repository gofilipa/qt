**** Lorde, Audre. "Uses of the erotic: the erotic as power." Sister Outsider (1984), pp. 53-59. 

Need to reclaim the erotic as a source of power, empowerment through
desire and joy. 

The difference between the erotic and the pornographic: both have to
do with pleasure, but the pornographic supresses feeling, pursuing
only sensation.  “The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of
our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an
internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it,
we know we can aspire” (54).  “erotic… is a question of how actually
and fully we can feel in the doing” (54).

Quantity vs quality: “There is a difference between painting a back
fence and writing a poem, but only one of quantity. And there is, for
me, no difference between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight
against the body of a woman l love” (58).

I wonder --- is she saying that the pornographic has to do with
quantity -- of sensation without feeling, and that the erotic has to
do with quality -- depth of feeling? This question of quantity over
quality interests me because it relates to the digital, and digital
aesthetics. To the question of digitization. There’s the claim by
Kittler that the digital brings us to a new regime of aesthetics where
media is just numbers, what Kittler calls “eyewash,” as opposed to
analogue media like photography and phonography, which stores data as
physical effects or traces. From the first page of Media, Film,
Typewriter: The general digitization of channels and information
erases the differences among individual media. Sound and image, voice
and text are reduced to surface effects, known to consumers as
interface. Sense and the senses turn into eyewash.. Inside the
computers themselves everything becomes a number: quantity without
image, sound or voice. 1 The claim that digital media lacks
physicality has been countered by media/literary theorists like
N. Katherine Hayles and Matt Kirschenbaum, who explore the very
physical effects of digital media, in Kirschenbaum’s case, looking at
how traces on a hard drive, for example, are as sensual and unique as
any other physical objects, though they perpetuate an illusion of
immateriality.

The use of Lord’s “erotic,” emphasizing the role of chaos in creating
intimacy or new modes of connection---something I had read, this word
“chaos,” and didn’t know what to do with: “The erotic is a measure
between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our
strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which,
once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire” (54). This idea
that chaos can be a bridge of connection. Reminds me of Brown, and
also of Jackson, who talks about dissolving the boundaries of the self
as a way of forming new ethical connections (we’ve seen this in
Brown’s Black Utopias). This is very smart, and it’s in keeping with
structures of thought from black lesbian feminists.

**** Snorton, C. Riley. Black on both sides: A racial history of trans
identity. U of Minnesota Press, 2017.

Looking at the black flesh that has been used to denigrate as a tool
of empowerment. White race and gender has been constructed out of the
reduction of body to flesh. This flesh, which has undergone this
reduction, can be a place of possibility, of fugitivity, of escape,
for example, in the concept of the “transcapable”. This "pornotrope"
suggests a state of chaos which can resist the fixity of
gender.

The book examines the "mechanics of invention," or the ways that black
life has been defined by "state grammars" (xiv).

Terms: "'Trans' is more about a movement with no clear origin and no
point of arrival, and 'blackness' signifies upon an enveloping
environment and condition of possibility" (2).

Concepts that we have today of gender depend on the reduction of flesh
to captive bodies: "Captive and divided flesh functions as malleable
matter for mediating and remaking sex and gender as matters of human
categorization and personal definition" (20). 
- "Captive flesh expressed an ungendered position that defines race as
  the sine qua non of sex" (34).
- "On the one hand, white femininity is conferred in relation to an
  unwillingness to view white female genitalia, that is, to look upon
  white women as flesh. On the other hand, the unrelenting scopic
  availability that defined blackness within the visual economy of
  racial slavery becomes the necessary context for producing a field
  of sex/gender knowledge" (33). 

Methodology: "This black and trans historiographical project" relies
on what has been omitted from the archive as "conditions of
possibility" (11). "The archives under review here are all products of
invention. What is necessary, then, are theoretical and historical
trajectories that further imaginative capacities to construct more
livable black and trans worlds" (14).  

Method is to read into the details of the archival record:
- The /smell/ indexes both racial/class hierarchy and resistance. "The
  discourse of disgust registered Anarcha's stench with the conjoined
  necropolitial and biopolitical logics of slavery and medicine, yet
  the recurrent descriptors of Anarcha's body odor provides an opening
  to imagine what modicums of protection might have been afforded by
  smelling noxious to one's enslaver" (27). 
- The /medical assistance/ by slaves opens speculation into "modes of
  nourishment and care" they provided one another (29). 
   - "the opacity in the archive on this matter [Betsey's procedure]
     leaves room to imagine how Betsey might have somehow resisted the
     performance of stoic bravery or willing subjectivity that she was
     compelled to produce" (25).
- The /daguerrotype/ "offers a visual grammar for reading the
  imbrications of 'race' and 'gender' under captivity" (40). 
    - "That the image does not reside on the surface but floats in an
      unmappable elsewhere offers an allegory for race as a procedure
      that exceeds the logics of a bodily surface, occuring by way of
      flesh, a racial mattering that appears through puncture in the
      form of a wound or covered by skin and screened from view"
      (40). 
    - For captive bodies, "flesh functioned as a disarticulation of
      human form from its anatomical features" (18).

examining what is inside the black hole (43). 


***** to read in between the contradictions - at the intersection of
race and gender. 

He picks apart the contradictions that produce race and gender. The
captive women Betsey, Lucy, and Anarcha and unnamed others enabled the
development of gynecology as a field while being simultaneously
disavowed as women. White femininity prevents the inspection of white
female genitalia, it is constructed out of the "scopic availability"
of black flesh (Snorton 33). Yet this genderless flesh is also a
"capacitating structure" which enables "fungibility for fugitive
movement" (Snorton 53). Additionally, while traditional racial
"passing" assumes white passing, it is blackness which gives one the
"gender indefiniteness" to enable "cross-gendered modes of escape"
(Snorton 56). For example, Snorton discusses the "blackening" of
Harriet Jacobs, the writer of /Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl/
(1861), as an escape strategy that s allowed her to obtain
"fungibility, thingness" to avoid recognition (Snorton 71). 

Answering to two arguments about the inevitability of Phillip DeVine's
death in the Brandon Teena murders, the first that his race was
irrelevant, and the second that it was a question of bad
timing. Snorton explains how the former argument demonstrates how
blackness as inconsequential becomes an excuse for violence, and the
second that, as a disabled black man, "DeVine's figuration [is] always
and already untimely, assigned to a conversation perpetually deferred"
from trans issues (Snorton 181).

methodology: inventing from the details of the archival record

DeVine's story, for example, "requires nothing short of invention"
(Snorton 183). 

In light of the "Say their names" imperatives from BLM and BTLM,
Snorton situates her project as part of an attempt to find new ways of
figuring black death, enumerating and naming black death, "a demand
for enw structures of naming that evince and evicerate the conditions
that continually produce black and trans death" (Snorton 195). 

Her method is to read into the details of the archival record....

**** Jackson, Zakiyyah Iman. /Becoming human: Matter and meaning in an antiblack world/. NYU Press, 2020.

There seems to be this move in Black/AfAm Studies that’s drawing on
newer ideas in Materialisms and the Philosophy of Science to overturn
ideas from the Enlightenment.

The ideas from contemporary science (plasticization, symbiosis) which
she takes and applies to her critique of Enlightenment. Dismantles
Enlightenment thought -- saying that blackness has not been “denied”
or “evacuated” but rather reappropriated, plasticized to suit liberal
humanist needs. What we think of as "Humanism" emerges from the
appropriation of black being and knowing. Human–animal dichotomies
inscribe, through their hierarchisation, violent orders.

This is essential, necessary work, and makes me think of feminist
scientists like Haraway (whom she cites) who began by critiquing
patriarchal approaches to empirical science (like the idea that
primate society is driven by competitions for dominance, rather than
collective cooperation). Also makes me think of New Materialist ideas
like Jane Bennett (whom she cites) who talk about consciousness being
something not only contained within the human or other beings but also
with objects. About the assemblage rather than the individual.

The ideas from Butler, which Jackson brings up, are key here. Butler
reimagines human subjectivity as not individual but collective,
arising from symbiosis between a variety of bodies and species. In
“Bloodchild,” Jacson reads “receptivity” rather than passivity. She
also claims that Butler doesn’t idealize symbiosis, but instead looks
at how conditions of unequal power can make it problematic.

**** TODO Musser, Amber. /Sensual Excess/
Sexuality/desire cannot be severed from domination. The pornotrope
(from Hotense Spillers): severing the body from social network,
gender, etc. Makes the body just flesh. And also mysterious, and
desirable.

Excess is in the surface, a way of confounding subjectivity and
subject coherence.

Violence produces flesh. Violence produces an excess (like hunger in
Holiday) which it cannot incorporate. 

"In Origin of the Universe 1 Thomas places rhinestones where we might
expect to see shadows. They appear in the creases of sheets, to mark the
contours of flesh, to demarcate nipples, pubic hair, and labial folds. They
disrupt the flat planes of color with their raised and sparkling presence.
Instead of peeking inward, we are distracted by surface and ornamentation.
Rhinestones offer Thomas a palette beyond oils; they provide a way
to expand the surface of her paintings and to gesture toward epistemologies
not captured by realism" (49).


"surface as a formal strategy of producing opacity. This activation of
a surface aesthetic serves as a rejection of the mandate of
transparency, while also enabling alternate modes of apprehending
pleasure and selfhood. There are several layers to thinking Thomas’s
relation to surface. First, there is the question of size. Origin of
the Universe 1 is a large painting (sixty by forty-eight inches),
which invites the contemplation of surface as a spectacle. In this
way, I understand spectacle to be operating in opposition to the
pornographic or scientific gaze in that through its excess, it
disrupts the possibility of contained knowledge.  Additionally, the
nature of spectacle invites us into the specific realm of black
hypervisuality through Thomas’s use of the rhinestone and the
reflective dimensions of their shine. Instead of vagina as void, the
rhinestones emphasize the ways that this vulva’s materiality lies at
the center of two epistemologies of intimacy—friction and narcissism"
(48).

"Thinking the rhinestone as a trace or residue of Thomas’s wetness and
excitement allows us to hold violence, excess, and possibility in the
same frame. Even as the source is ambiguous, the idea that rhinestones
might offer a record of pleasure—-pleasure that is firmly constituted
in and of the flesh—-shows us a form of self-possession.  This self is
not outside of objectification, but its embellishment and insistence
on the trace of excitement speaks to the centrality of pleasure in
theorizations of self-love." (63).

**** TODO Brown, Jayna. Black Utopias: Speculative Life and the Music of Other Worlds. Duke University Press, 2021. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1dgmm37. Accessed 8 Jul. 2022.

Brown points out in Bulter the tension between what in our human
nature allows us to transcend our species and what prevents us from
doing so. Either humanity will “grow” or it will “prevail.

Brown is re-conceiving sensation and desire to transcend the bounded
subject.

Black subjects, being excluded from the ‘human’, have a mobility, an ‘untethered state’ (7). 

She asks, “Does the self need bounded wholeness in order to feel, or
can it thrive in the effluent?” (14). She zeroes in on the
potentiality of “flesh” in its reduction to avoid the markings of
subjectivity: “Flesh… is free of the need for subjectivity. I contend
that there is freedom in the flesh, in the moments when it is excluded
from being marked, as it feels, and responds to, touch”
(11). Sensation, desire, and flesh all reach toward a kind of merging.

The freedom in this reduction recalls snorton’s transcapable.

She creates a model for understanding the role of the flesh in
reconceiving the subject, which allows us to rethink agency and
consent. 

quotes:

**** Jennifer L. Morgan. /Reckoning with Slavery/. 

From [[https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/li_qipehreviews_reckoning_with_slavery/][review]]:

 "Over the course of six chapters, Reckoning with Slavery models a way
 of accounting for and filling in this archival silence, namely by
 reading references to gender and kinship “as a type of irruption”
 (p. 49). Attending to the canonical writings of the fifteenth-century
 Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Zurara, for instance, Morgan
 demonstrates how Zurara’s description of the grief of the enslaved
 reveals the damage that market forces wreak on networks of
 kinship. Similarly, in her analysis of a diagrammatic cross section
 of the crowded hold of a slave ship, she notes movingly that the
 easily missed image of an enslaved woman giving birth on board
 signals the horrors of children being viewed as commodities. Such a
 mode of reading reframes early colonial texts about slavery as
 implicit critiques of it and, in doing so, offers a way of
 interpreting narratives as counternarratives and a glimpse at the
 radical forms historical reconstruction can take. No longer is
 historical reconstruction merely about writing a more expansive
 history including the previously excluded voices of women and
 girls—itself a formidable task. It is also about rethinking the
 foundations of this history in terms of their movements and roles.

 What Reckoning with Slavery brings to literary-historical studies,
 then, is an archival practice that is at once historicist and
 reparative. On one hand, it is invested in interpreting a spotty
 historical record ethically, and this is shown in the book by Morgan
 as she brings together different archives to map a more accurate and
 comprehensive global history. That it leans so productively on
 Portuguese texts to chart a partial history of the slave trade in the
 English Americas is but one example. On the other hand, however, the
 book is also not bound by what is present in historical archives, and
 this is where it shines. Many of the stories of enslaved women might
 never be recovered, but Reckoning with Slavery shows how their
 stories might still be told by reading their silences creatively. The
 absence of women from the history of slave revolts, for instance,
 might not necessarily mean that they failed to participate in these
 uprisings or that they only participated in tiny, quotidian ways. It
 might also mean that their deeds were erased because women were so
 foundational to these uprisings that they inspired unease. Such a
 creative methodology paves the way for new, provocative historical
 narratives to be written."

**** Dereck Scott, Extravagant Abjection: “Slavery, Rape, and the
 Black Male Abject”

Analyzing abjection - “Even in the abject there is something with
which to work” (146).

“Or is it possible that there is a self-seeking in the act (especially
as the violating act becomes systematized, routinized), a subject
questing after its own forms of relief and, in so doing, questing
after the terms by which to know and to experience itself?” (162).

Toni Morrison reworks tropes of male emasculation into male rape,
while doing so both figures it as a possibility and surrounding it
with silence: “to figure both the possibility of sexual exploitation
of men and the silence surrounding this possibility” (132). It eludes
our access for a few reasons.

Representational strategy -- to shape a silence while breaking it… the
emptiness left by a boom or a cry”

Reminds me of William James’s idea about thought being continuous, a
“stream”, illustrated by the word: “Thunder-breaking-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it…. the feeling
of the thunder is also a feeling of the silence as just gone” (234).

 Language can work with and against this idea. It works against this
 idea by using discrete names for things, when everything is actually
 part of an ecosystem of interconnection, a continuous sensorium. But
 we can see this in syntactic structures, particularly in
 conjunctions, prepositions, and inflections of voice. James talks
 about how the stream of thought is continually moving from idea to
 idea, and there are moments of “flight” between the ideas, the
 “resting places.” In the moments of flight we can grasp the movement,
 but not completely: “Our experiences actually match the shadings and
 nuances of language, so we ‘ought to say a feeling of and, and a
 feeling of if, a feeling of but, and a feeling of by, quite as
 readily as we say a feeling of blue or a feeling of cold’ (The
 Principles of Psychology 378).”  “Rapid premonitory perspective views
 of schemes of thought not yet articulate” (245).  I’m thinking of
 language as a representational strategy, as a way to represent what
 is unrepresentable, à la Hartman. To tell an impossible story.

We don’t normally easily imagine the male submission, even though it’s
a repressed trauma--- “testeria”: the complicated relationship of
control and desire.

and Naturalized Others of Octavia E. Butler’s Lilith’s Brood," The
Bloomsbury Handbook to Octavia Butler. pp. 95-115.

/Dawn/ concept of posthumanism revises the anthropocentric and
patriarchal hegemony of humanism. The key difference for this kind of
posthumanism is a craving to integrate and accumulate difference,
rather than define themselves against it.

"Lilith’s Brood prompts us to question how our relationships and sense
of kinship with the racialized, sexualized, and naturalized Other
might look, if, like the Oankali, we chose to “embrace difference”
(Adulthood Rites 329); might we, as a result, now recognize the Other
within us?" (Dunkley 113-114).

"Humanism functions on the apotheosis of the anthropos and a belief in
its inherent worth, autonomy, rationality, and capabilities—-qualities
intended to affirm our status at the pinnacle of the Cartesian
hierarchy, above animals, machines, and the Other" (Dunkley 97).

"Oankali are ostensibly constructed so as to invert our Humanistic
egocentrism—-not only is difference not considered the source of fear
for the Oankali, but they are physiologically engineered to hunger for
it" (Dunkley 96).

"In fact, the ontological danger that the ooloi pose to the system of
Humanism is most acutely felt by the men, for whom the ooloi come to
represent rival figures... threaten to usurp the men’s position at the
pinnacle of a gendered hierarchy, usurpation that is especially
calamitous given the ooloi’s role as sexual penetrator—-an
ideologically loaded function, connoting uniquely masculine traits of
power, virility, and strength" (Dunkley 100).

Nature," The Bloomsbury Handbook to Octavia Butler. pp. 11-13.

"she tended to ground her opinions of humanity in her biological
research" (Barnes 11).

**** overview of alien and flesh sections:
The "aliens" section examines human vs Oankali social structures to
read the role of sensuality and feeling in their relationships and
ethics. The Oankali offer a model of ethics based on feeling, rather
than choice or consent. They achieve this model by bypassing the
organ, the flesh, in favor of direct neural connection.

It then turns to the flesh, to examine how it can be redeployed
through the very reduction to materiality that causes problems.

We begin by taking a deeper look at the human contradiction and
racialization. 
- Reconstructing the simile: Chicana theory of fear of similarity
  enabled by the human contradiction.
- Drive to put things in a hierarhcy, use intelligence to do so. 

Oankali social structure bases social relations on pleasure; allows
them to bypass barrier of fear. 
- The bypassing of flesh bypasses consent, prioritizes pleasure
- Crucially, it also scrambles traditional distinctions between
  thought and feeling. Boundaries become permeable.

How can black femininst studies help us to read the flesh, then?

For humans, the flesh is a problem, a barrier to more pleasurable
forms of social organization. Black feminists help us to see how the
Flesh can be redeployed. 
- The emphasis on the surface finds fugitivity, foreclosure.

The aliens give us a social problem, fixed with a physiological
solution. It involves bypassing the flesh. Once we are in this place,
our distinctions between sense and thought dissolve. Consent becomes
mutual feeling. 

The black feminists give us a method of reading resistance into the
flesh. 

We then move this redeployment from the physiological to the
technological.

*** Media Archaeology 

**** Flesh enables re-formulation (queer form)
Looking at racialization and the flesh reveals strategies of reading
of the flesh rooted in its *materiality*. In possibilities contained
within the reduction to the physical. It leads to a *re-formulation*
for understanding the interaction between the material and the
symbolic in media.

**** Media Archaeology overview

Kittler vs Kirschenbaum 
- Media is undifferentiated, immaterial (Kittler) vs media is durable,
  particular (Kirschenbaum). Kirschenbaum wants to unflatten the 0s
  and 1s.
- Kirschenbaum's registers: Forensic vs Formal levels.
- Engaging with media always implies displacement. Oral history
  quote. 
- Hansen and perceptual extensibility. 
- There is always a quality of inaccessibility, of remove, what we
  might call opacity.
- The torque of switching between. The shifting between different
  layers, abstractions.
- The vulnerability - being open to feeling/chaos that dissolves
  boundaries (unsure how this relates to media). 

*** the flesh
**** methodology: flipping the reductions
***** queer form
Taking what has been reduced as a tool for strategic opacity. 

When it comes to black bodies, the method of reduction has been
pornotroping, or /reducing the body to flesh/ (see Spillers, Snorton,
Musser). The reduction to flesh is what enables violence.

When it comes to technology, what is the method of reduction? It a
method of /abstracting the physical computational processes/,
displacing the physical operations of the CPU, memory, and hard drives
to screens (Kirschenbaum). So the flesh, unexpectedly, is /formal/
(not physical) materiality, what we see on the screen. The
computational processes have been reduced to these screen effects,
which we perceive as being disconnected from a body, from the
hardware. Flesh is a surface.

**** positionality and politics
How to theorize from black flesh but not instrumentalize it, not
diminish the real violences and suffering of black people. What are
ways of theorizing with blackness without perpetuating its
exploitation?

It's about a method of thinking at the intersection of two
registers. The story of the black flesh helps us to understand how
race was constructed for the purpose of oppression and
hierarchization. This can be applied to technology, to allow us to
rethink and relearn the way we use technology toward more equitable
ends. The current discourse of technology tends toward neoliberal
notions of productivity, monetization, privatization. Knowing the
discourse and how it works to conceal itself. Knowing how to
deconstruct and to build. To start over, like in /Dawn/.

What women of color have been thinking and writing about for decades,
is only just now reaching the attention of mainstream feminism. 

To think of the surface effects of computation as a way of thinking
about the physical realm. To bring the body back to the
flesh. Considering the flesh as a formal phenomenon made from a
physical reality. Being at the intersection of the digital and the
analog, the intersection of two registers, will open up the kind of
thinking we can do. This is the kind of thinking we will need to, in
Anzaldua's words, "see from both sides at once". This is about
capacious thinking.

**** Black Feminist Thinking and New Materialisms
Writers in Black Studies have been revising New Materialisms, reorient
discussions on materiality away from white masculinist perspectives
and celebrating a lineage of marginalized thinkers
***** The Pornotrope

The pornotrope suggests a state of chaos which can resist the fixity
of gender.

***** Pornotrope vs Pornographic: Snorton v. Lorde
There seems to be a misalignment between the pornographic in Lorde and
the pornotropic in Snorton/Musser. 

- The pornographic (Lorde) supresses feeling, pursuing only sensation,
  which opposes the erotic, which is "a measure between the beginnings
  of our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings" (54).

- Flesh (Snorton) is supposed to be this thing which eludes capture,
  but at the same time creates possibility. Snorton seems to suggest
  that we can get at resistance through the reduction to flesh, in the
  concept of the “transcapable”. That the pornotrope suggests a state
  of chaos which can resist the fixity of gender.

If the pornographic is just flesh, just pure sensation, we might build
an erotics from it. The reduction to flesh might represent potential
for depth of feeling. /Looking at the flesh for it’s erotic potential/
rather than the pornographic which is imposed upon it.

***** The Flesh and Subjectivity/Desire by Brown, Musser, Snorton
According to Hortense Spillers, the black body, by the violences in
the middle passage, has undergone a reduction to flesh.

This reduction to flesh, for Snorton, Musser, (Brown, Jackson?), opens
a space of possibility.  

For Snorton, Black flesh, as a reduction, can be a place of
possibility. An opportunity to read the details. 

For Musser, flesh is produced by violence. Violence produces an excess
(like hunger in Holiday) which it cannot incorporate. Sexuality/desire
cannot be severed from domination. According to Musser, it seems that
some kind of violence---the violence of marking the
subject/object---is necessary in the experience of flesh and
pleasure. “To think with the flesh and to inhabit the pornotrope is to
hold violence and possibility in the same frame” (Musser 12).

For Jackson, Blackness is plasticized at the service of violent
hierarchies of domination, such as "dehumanization" of blackness.

For Morgan and Johnson, looking at the structure of the thing to find
possibilities for resistance, for freedom and intimacy in the archive.

And additionally, that there is this contradiction (or paradox?)
within desire, which is between possession and dissolution---desire is
about a sovereign subject attempting to possess another, this is the
drive or impulse of desire; but at the same time, at the height of
desire, its ultimate goal, is about dissolution, about the melting
away of the subject. What if we reconceptualize desire as the impulse
to possess or dissolve, but without a subject?

***** Embodied and extended cognition
Folks from afam studies, like Jackson and Brown, are reconceptualizing
the human to go beyond the confines of the body, into ecology,
environment, via affective registers. 

Flesh, for Musser, can represent a state of freedom of connection, at
the same time that it is a sign of objectification: “Flesh… is free of
the need for subjectivity. I contend that there is freedom in the
flesh, in the moments when it is excluded from being marked, as it
feels, and responds to, touch” (Brown 11).

***** Flesh and absence: what is formally not representable 

There are two ideas: 
- Flesh as a site of possibility (see above) - what the reduction
  opens up.
- Flesh as an indicator of what is not representable (Scott).

Scott's /Extravagant Abjection/:

To feel what is not there -- to shape a silence. To find form in
apparent formlessness (with the help of James). 

Potential connection to media archaeology: the way that the immaterial
level (what we cannot see or touch) influences the formal level. How
the immaterial enables a continuous sensorium, an ecosystem of
interconnection.

*** resisting violence in the archive: Snorton, Hartman
For his "black and trans historiographical project," Snorton
demonstrates flesh as the physical and malleable material that enables
the construction of social categories like race and gender. Similar to
scholars of slavery's archive like Saidiya Hartman, Snorton's method
takes the details of the archival record as "conditions of
possibility" in his study, and reads for hints of resistance contained
within the dominant narrative that suggest the ommitted, obscured, or
elided experience of black subjects (Snorton 11). This methodology
uses the critical imagination to read into what Hartman and others
call "the violence of the archive," a violence not only in the form of
evidence, that the records literally obscure or overlook information,
but also in the tools of expression, in the language that cannot
approximate experience, and in the discourse that dictates silence
(2). Like "Critical fabulation," Snorton's reading of archival
material draws narrative from the gaps and lacunae of the evidence,
working to "expose and exploit the incommensurability between the
experience of the enslaved and the fictions of history" (Hartman
10). One example concerns a slave woman, Anarcha, whose severe case of
Vaginal Fistula made her an object of medical experimentation. Because
the record that hardly mentions her by name (when it does not misname
her) is silent about her experience of what certainly were painful and
prolonged surgeries without anesthetics, Snorton turns to seemingly
minor details like smell and the presence of other enslaved women to
"further imaginative capacities" for reading resistance
(14). Anarcha's reportedly offensive smell, what Snorton calls the
"discourse of disgust," for example, indexes both her subjection to
social hierarchy and her resistance, for "the recurrent descriptors of
Anarcha's body odor provides an opening to imagine what modicums of
protection might have been afforded by smelling noxious to one's
enslaver" (27). Additionally, the banal reality of servitude implies
that other slave women such as Lucy and Betsey (among others who were
unnamed), stood as medical assitants when necessary, which opens
speculation into "modes of nourishment and care" they provided one
another (Snorton 29); In one procedure on Betsey, for example, Snorton
explains that "the opacity in the archive... leaves room to imagine
how Betsey might have somehow resisted the performance of stoic
bravery or willing subjectivity that she was compelled to produce"
(25).
