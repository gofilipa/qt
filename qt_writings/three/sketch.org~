and Amber Musser), Media Archaeology/New Materialisms (Kirschenbaum).

Object: Hyperfiction /These Waves/, Science Fiction /Dawn/. 

Method: Close reading of /Dawn/, Media archaeological reading of
/Waves/. A methodology of studying digital media which attends to its
physicality, what Kirschenbaum describes as the forensic and formal
levels of materiality.

**** Audre, Lorde. "Uses of the erotic: the erotic as power." Sister Outsider (1984), pp. 53-59. 

Need to reclaim the erotic as a source of power, empowerment through
desire and joy. 

The difference between the erotic and the pornographic: both have to
do with pleasure, but the pornographic supresses feeling, pursuing
only sensation.  “The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of
our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an
internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it,
we know we can aspire” (54).  “erotic… is a question of how actually
and fully we can feel in the doing” (54).

Quantity vs quality: “There is a difference between painting a back
fence and writing a poem, but only one of quantity. And there is, for
me, no difference between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight
against the body of a woman l love” (58).

I wonder --- is she saying that the pornographic has to do with
quantity -- of sensation without feeling, and that the erotic has to
do with quality -- depth of feeling? This question of quantity over
quality interests me because it relates to the digital, and digital
aesthetics. To the question of digitization. There’s the claim by
Kittler that the digital brings us to a new regime of aesthetics where
media is just numbers, what Kittler calls “eyewash,” as opposed to
analogue media like photography and phonography, which stores data as
physical effects or traces. From the first page of Media, Film,
Typewriter: The general digitization of channels and information
erases the differences among individual media. Sound and image, voice
and text are reduced to surface effects, known to consumers as
interface. Sense and the senses turn into eyewash.. Inside the
computers themselves everything becomes a number: quantity without
image, sound or voice. 1 The claim that digital media lacks
physicality has been countered by media/literary theorists like
N. Katherine Hayles and Matt Kirschenbaum, who explore the very
physical effects of digital media, in Kirschenbaum’s case, looking at
how traces on a hard drive, for example, are as sensual and unique as
any other physical objects, though they perpetuate an illusion of
immateriality.

The use of Lord’s “erotic,” emphasizing the role of chaos in creating
intimacy or new modes of connection---something I had read, this word
“chaos,” and didn’t know what to do with: “The erotic is a measure
between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our
strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which,
once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire” (54). This idea
that chaos can be a bridge of connection. Reminds me of Brown, and
also of Jackson, who talks about dissolving the boundaries of the self
as a way of forming new ethical connections (we’ve seen this in
Brown’s Black Utopias). This is very smart, and it’s in keeping with
structures of thought from black lesbian feminists.

identity. U of Minnesota Press, 2017.

Looking at the quality that has been used (black flesh) to denigrate
as a tool of empowerment.

The ways that white bodies & gender has been constructed out of black flesh. This black flesh, this reduction, can be a place of possibility, of fugitivity, of escape, for example. 
 
Chapter 1: how the field of gynecology, which is about sex/gender in
white women, was only possible by the scopic access to black
flesh. Captive flesh is ungendered. Echoes here of Hartman’s method,
of critical fabulation. Wondering what kinds of ways did the female
slaves care for each other during the “scientific procedures.” They
are the raw materials for creating a gender from which they are
excluded.

 “The narratives of American gynecology’s founding clarify how chattel
 slavery functioned as one cultural apparatus that brought sex and
 gender into arrangement; the instrument in such an encounter occurred
 in and as flesh” (52).

Chapter 2: how does this state of gender indefiniteness create
possibilities of resistance, of escape? The cross dressing of runaway
slaves.

 “the black’s figurative capacity to change form as a commoditized
 being engendered flow” (59).

**** TODO Zakiyyah Iman Jackson. /Becoming Human/. NYU Press, 2020.
Dismantles Enlightenment thought -- saying that blackness has not been
“denied” or “evacuated” but rather reappropriated, plasticized to suit
liberal humanist needs. What we think of as "Humanism" emerges from
the appropriation of black being and knowing. Human–animal dichotomies
inscribe, through their hierarchisation, violent orders.

The ideas from contemporary science (plasticization, symbiosis) which
she takes and applies to her critique of Enlightenment. This is
essential, necessary work, and makes me think of feminist scientists
like Haraway (whom she cites) who began by critiquing patriarchal
approaches to empirical science (like the idea that primate society is
driven by competitions for dominance, rather than collective
cooperation). Also makes me think of New Materialist ideas like Jane
Bennett (whom she cites) who talk about consciousness being something
not only contained within the human or other beings but also with
objects. About the assemblage rather than the individual. There seems
to be this move in Black/AfAm Studies that’s drawing on newer ideas in
Materialisms and the Philosophy of Science.

The ideas from Butler, which Jackson brings up, are key here. Butler
reimagines human subjectivity as not individual but collective,
arising from symbiosis between a variety of bodies and species. In
“Bloodchild,” Jacson reads “receptivity” rather than passivity. She
also claims that Butler doesn’t idealize symbiosis, but instead looks
at how conditions of unequal power can make it problematic.

**** TODO Jessica Marie Johnson. /Wicked Flesh/. 
Johnson takes something very constraining--marriage and baptism
records--and turns it into a mechanism for reading intimacy. 

I am interested in projects like Jessica Marie Johnson’s which examine
existing structures for modes of resistance, and in particular for
modes of resistance that emerge from the logics of those
structures. Johnson takes something very constraining, that is, the
social structures available to African and African-descent women who
lived during and sometimes operated within the slave-trading 18th
century. She studies civil records of marriage and baptism for the
ways they enable new productions of intimacy, which is a practice of
freedom.

From my point of view, Johnson’s project addresses the problem of
data, which is the problem of the archive in the Atlantic World. Her
methodology is to close-read the civil records to create a
“promiscuous accounting of blackness not as bondage and subjection,
but as future possibility” (10). The records, on their own, tell a
story of bondage and subjection to power. Johnson’s job is to
construct a narrative around these records, about the “ways black
women sought out profane, pleasurable, and erotic entanglements as
practices of freedom” (12). In “Markup Bodies,”another piece by this
author, Johnson argues that data on its own re-enacts the
commodification of black bodies---that black bodies are reduced to
data points. In order to subvert the reduction of bodies to “data,”
data has to be supplemented with “black digital practice,” which are
the rich histories of black embodiment, the narrative that surrounds
the data, which accompanies the database.

How are the records themselves constituted and structured? Databases
themselves are far from neutral (as Johnson undoubtedly would
agree). They are constructed, structured data. I’m curious about the
formal aspects of this database, in the decisions made not only in
their creation but in their preservation. What if we think of these
records as their own data format, and examine the structures /
boundaries of that format?

Is there something within this structure that allows us to read an
emergent freedom?

**** TODO Jennifer L. Morgan. /Reckoning with Slavery/. 

From [[https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/li_qipehreviews_reckoning_with_slavery/][review]]:

 "Over the course of six chapters, Reckoning with Slavery models a way
 of accounting for and filling in this archival silence, namely by
 reading references to gender and kinship “as a type of irruption”
 (p. 49). Attending to the canonical writings of the fifteenth-century
 Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Zurara, for instance, Morgan
 demonstrates how Zurara’s description of the grief of the enslaved
 reveals the damage that market forces wreak on networks of
 kinship. Similarly, in her analysis of a diagrammatic cross section
 of the crowded hold of a slave ship, she notes movingly that the
 easily missed image of an enslaved woman giving birth on board
 signals the horrors of children being viewed as commodities. Such a
 mode of reading reframes early colonial texts about slavery as
 implicit critiques of it and, in doing so, offers a way of
 interpreting narratives as counternarratives and a glimpse at the
 radical forms historical reconstruction can take. No longer is
 historical reconstruction merely about writing a more expansive
 history including the previously excluded voices of women and
 girls—itself a formidable task. It is also about rethinking the
 foundations of this history in terms of their movements and roles.

 What Reckoning with Slavery brings to literary-historical studies,
 then, is an archival practice that is at once historicist and
 reparative. On one hand, it is invested in interpreting a spotty
 historical record ethically, and this is shown in the book by Morgan
 as she brings together different archives to map a more accurate and
 comprehensive global history. That it leans so productively on
 Portuguese texts to chart a partial history of the slave trade in the
 English Americas is but one example. On the other hand, however, the
 book is also not bound by what is present in historical archives, and
 this is where it shines. Many of the stories of enslaved women might
 never be recovered, but Reckoning with Slavery shows how their
 stories might still be told by reading their silences creatively. The
 absence of women from the history of slave revolts, for instance,
 might not necessarily mean that they failed to participate in these
 uprisings or that they only participated in tiny, quotidian ways. It
 might also mean that their deeds were erased because women were so
 foundational to these uprisings that they inspired unease. Such a
 creative methodology paves the way for new, provocative historical
 narratives to be written."

**** TODO Jayna Brown. /Black Utopias/

I’m interested in how Brown is re-conceiving sensation and desire to
transcend the bounded subject. She asks, “Does the self need bounded
wholeness in order to feel, or can it thrive in the effluent?”
(14). She zeroes in on the potentiality of “flesh” as a site that can
avoid the “markings” of subjectivity: “Flesh… is free of the need for
subjectivity. I contend that there is freedom in the flesh, in the
moments when it is excluded from being marked, as it feels, and
responds to, touch” (11). Sensation, desire, and flesh all reach
toward a kind of merging.

- Black subjects, being excluded from the ‘human’, have a mobility, an
‘untethered state’ (7). “Does the self need bounded wholeness in order
to feel, or can it thrive in the effluent?” (14).  

- “Perhaps we can think of desire differently: not as consumption but as
relation of and charged with the potential to explode all attempts to
order and contain it” (14).

**** TODO Musser, Amber. /Sensual Excess/
Sexuality/desire cannot be severed from domination. 

The pornotrope (from Hotense Spillers): severing the body from social
network, gender, etc. Makes the body just flesh. And also mysterious,
and desirable.

**** Saidiya, Hartman. "Venus in Two Acts." Small Axe 12.2 (2008): 1-14.

How do we know what was never recorded? How do we represent what was
never recorded without reinscribing the violence of exclusion,
mutilation?

 “How does one resist the scene of subjection without replicating the
 grammar of violence?” (4).

 "Picture them: The relics of two girls, one cradling the other,
 plundered innocents; a sailor caught sight of them and later said
 they were friends. Two world-less girls found a country in each
 other’s arms. Beside the defeat and the terror, there would be this
 too: the glimpse of beauty, the instant of possibility” (8).

By critical fabulation:

 “Is it possible to exceed or negotiate the constitutive limits of the
 archive? By advancing a series of speculative arguments and
 exploiting the capacities of the subjunctive (a grammatical mood that
 expresses doubts, wishes, and possibilities), in fashioning a
 narrative, which is based upon archival research, and by that I mean
 a critical reading of the archive that mimes the figurative
 dimensions of history, I intended both to tell an impossible story
 and to amplify the impossibility of its telling” (11).

 “By playing with and rearranging the basic elements of the story, by
 re-presenting the sequence of events in divergent stories and from
 contested points of view, I have attempted to jeopardize the status
 of the event, to displace the received or authorized account, and to
 imagine what might have happened or might have been said or might
 have been done” (11).

 “The intent of this practice is not to give voice to the slave, but
 rather to imagine what cannot be verified, a realm of experience
 which is situated between two zones of death—social and corporeal
 death—and to reckon with the precarious lives which are visible only
 in the moment of their disappearance” (12).

 "the essay mimes the violence of the archive and attempts to redress
 it by describing as fully as possible the conditions that determine
 the appearance of Venus and that dictate her silence” (1).

**** Dereck Scott, Extravagant Abjection: “Slavery, Rape, and the
 Black Male Abject”

Analyzing abjection - “Even in the abject there is something with
which to work” (146).

“Or is it possible that there is a self-seeking in the act (especially
as the violating act becomes systematized, routinized), a subject
questing after its own forms of relief and, in so doing, questing
after the terms by which to know and to experience itself?” (162).

Toni Morrison reworks tropes of male emasculation into male rape,
while doing so both figures it as a possibility and surrounding it
with silence: “to figure both the possibility of sexual exploitation
of men and the silence surrounding this possibility” (132). It eludes
our access for a few reasons.

Representational strategy -- to shape a silence while breaking it… the
emptiness left by a boom or a cry”

Reminds me of William James’s idea about thought being continuous, a
“stream”, illustrated by the word: “Thunder-breaking-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it…. the feeling
of the thunder is also a feeling of the silence as just gone” (234).

 Language can work with and against this idea. It works against this
 idea by using discrete names for things, when everything is actually
 part of an ecosystem of interconnection, a continuous sensorium. But
 we can see this in syntactic structures, particularly in
 conjunctions, prepositions, and inflections of voice. James talks
 about how the stream of thought is continually moving from idea to
 idea, and there are moments of “flight” between the ideas, the
 “resting places.” In the moments of flight we can grasp the movement,
 but not completely: “Our experiences actually match the shadings and
 nuances of language, so we ‘ought to say a feeling of and, and a
 feeling of if, a feeling of but, and a feeling of by, quite as
 readily as we say a feeling of blue or a feeling of cold’ (The
 Principles of Psychology 378).”  “Rapid premonitory perspective views
 of schemes of thought not yet articulate” (245).  I’m thinking of
 language as a representational strategy, as a way to represent what
 is unrepresentable, à la Hartman. To tell an impossible story.

We don’t normally easily imagine the male submission, even though it’s
a repressed trauma--- “testeria”: the complicated relationship of
control and desire.

**** TODO Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley, /Ezili’s Mirrors/

The issue of queer identity: is it a performance or an inhabitation:
Gender as plurality, inhabitation or construction. Gender is not a
performance, but an ecosystem. This writing tries to do away with
systems that already exist (43).

What is “femme”? Femme is a “je ne sais quoi of desiring difference
prior to any determination of sexual preference or gender identity”
(40).

I know I mentioned this in class, but I keep on getting stuck on this
idea of gender as inhabitation. This idea emerges when Tinsley
describes the “submerged epistemology of gender variance” in the drag
king, “MilDred”: "All people have the possibility to be simultaneously
man and woman, Shaft and Foxy Brown, packing and lacy—but not because
gender is constructed, or performative, or any other queer theoretical
word. No, because they’re always surrounded by multiple, multiply
gendered spirits and may temporarily become any of these spirits at
any time" (43). I have been conceiving gender as a performance
(according to Butler, “performativity”), which precedes and constructs
the subject, while also creating the possibility for resistance by
resignifying gender norms. Describing this resistance, Butler famously
asks: "What would it mean to cite the law to produce it differently,
to 'cite' the law in order to reiterate and coopt its power, to expose
the heterosexual matrix and to displace the effect of its necessity?"
(p. 15).  As someone who has been thinking of gender as a kind of
enabling constraint, I wonder at what it means to reconceive gender as
something which is purely enabling, as a kind of freeing, creative,
and spiritual force. Gender as something which inhabits bodies,
something which exists outside (maybe prior to?) the body, that can
move easily in between bodies.

This seriously disrupts my thinking about gender. For much of the work that I’m doing, I need gender to be constituted by power relations, and to be something constraining, which subjects can resist. Much of the work I’m doing looks for this kind of structure in queerness and technology. But I do wonder about thinking of gender as something spiritual and emergent. I would have to think more about the kind of work that this perspective will allow me to do.

**** Roderick A. Ferguson, "Queer of Color Critique"
https://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-33

Queer of Color Critique is reactung against the collapsing of
difference in identity politics--queer theory was creating identities
for things in a way that incorporates/ignores intra-group
differences. Intersectionality disrupts the pluralism of
multiculturalism. 

"To the extent that queer studies understood sexuality to be singularly
constituted, the field betrayed its own investments in Eurocentric
presumptions of uniformity"

Building of Norma Alarcon, Kimberle Williams Crenshaw. Showing how
QOCC appears in Munoz.

"Queer of color critique began as a U.S.-based critical discourse
responding to the circumstances of migration, neoliberal state and
economic formations, and the developments of racial knowledges and
subjectivities about sexual and gender minorities within the United
States. As a convergence with and a departure from queer studies,
queer of color critique signaled the ways in which the dominant
literary, philosophical, and aesthetic engagements with queer
sexuality distanced themselves from the study of race and from
politico-economic concerns."

"As an effort designed to address connections between race, sexuality,
and political economy, queer of color critique had to begin by
confronting a founding limitation of queer studies, a limitation that
obscured the very connections that queer of color critique was
interested in exposing. That limitation had to do with an initial
ambivalence within queer studies about the connections that sexuality
has to other modes of difference....This presumed equivalence and
authenticity imply a liberal pluralism aimed at including racial and
gender subjects into existing normative institutions and systems."

"Consider, for instance, Norma Alarcón’s critique of the identity
politics of Anglo-American feminism in her 1990 essay “The Theoretical
Subjects of This Bridge Called My Back.” In that essay Alarcón
considers the epistemological impact of women of color feminism, in
general, and the 1981 anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings
by Radical Women of Color. For Alarcón, the overall work of women of
color feminists and the volume are significant not because they
offered a “rainbow theory” or a discourse of authenticity. They were
significant because they called into question the implicit subject of
Anglo-American feminism. As Alarcón put it, “[The] most popular
subject of Anglo-American feminism is an autonomous, self-making,
self-determining subject who first proceeds according to the logic of
identification with regard to the subject of consciousness, a notion
usually viewed as the purview of man, but now claimed for women.”"

"For Alarcón, This Bridge and women of color feminism analyzed the
ways in which patriarchal and liberal notions of agency account for
the ideological structure of Anglo-American feminism. In doing so,
Alarcón produces a devastating critique of how Anglo-American feminism
attempted to base feminist authenticity on a replication rather than a
repudiation of heteropatriarchal agency."

"Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw’s classic article “Mapping the Margins:
Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of
Color” provided another example of how intersectional work was a
critique of authenticity politics. For instance, in her discussion of
identity politics, she argued, “The problem with identity politics is
not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge,
but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores
intra-group differences.”11 Crenshaw offered intersectionality as a
critique of the ways in which race and gender were politicized as
consistent with ideologies of discreteness and authenticity. As she
stated, “Feminist efforts to politicize experiences of women and
antiracist efforts to politicize people of color have frequently
proceeded as though the issues and experiences they each detail occur
in mutually exclusive terrains.”12 In designating race and gender as
categories that are constituted in relation to each other as well as
other social differences, Crenshaw presented intersectionality as a
means for disrupting discourses of authenticity and providing
alternatives to those discourses."

"Instead of arguing for the authenticity of categories of race and
gender, women of color feminism and its intersectional strategies can
be productively interpreted as attempts to show the limits of
authenticity discourses and the ways that those discourses
marginalized women of color. Contrary to the notion that modes of
difference can be understood singularly, women of color feminists
advanced arguments that posited those modes as necessarily constituted
in relation to one another, for historical and political reasons."

"Muñoz defines the hermeneutical properties of disidentification by
arguing, “For the critic, disidentification is the hermeneutical
performance of decoding mass, high, or any other cultural field from
the perspective of a minority subject who is disempowered in such a
representational hierarchy.”

**** Roderick A. Ferguson’s Aberration in Black: Toward a Queer of Critique
"The book attempted to demonstrate the ways in which the discipline’s
liberal regard for African Americans was precisely the mechanism for
constructing African American culture as outside of the normative
boundaries of the archetypal Western subject and the citizen-subject
of the United States."

*** Butler's /Dawn/ reading notes
**** Queerness in Dawn:
Not typically queer, in that there are no queer characters, but the
novel calls into question the role of individual sovereignty, the
boundaries of the body and subjectivity, which resists
heteronormativity as theorized by liberal subjectivity. 

The debate about whether Octavia Butler was queer or not, and the
speculation into her archive. The debate shows perhaps that her
queerness in life is besides the point. What is more queer, is the
debate itself. The speculation. 

There is a deep ambivalence between the ethical and the practical
course of action in the novel. Each time that I read /Dawn/, I get a
different message of what a human ought to do. The writing reinforces
this ambivalence, the way that the narrator's resolution wavers, or is
revealed to the reader piecemeal.
**** Inter-subjectivity/Collectivity:
Dawn presents the radical question of interspecies breeding. The
interspecies breeding, which emerges as part of the essential
collectivity of the Oankali, resists notions of human autonomy and
subjectivity. 

The relation between this and the distributed cognitive
environment. Perhaps this fear of being part of the collective is a
fear of being subsumed by technological advancement?

** brainstorms 
*** methodology: flipping the reductions

The way that black feminist thinkers are using what has been
weaponized against them for their own power. Using the pornotrope as a
site of possibility (Musser and Snorton). 

This has to do with queer form -- it's about taking what has been a
method of reduction, what has been a tool for appropriating the
complexity of real world objects for the purpose of exploitation, and
using that to instead seek out moments of illegibility, opacity. To
multiply rather than resolve meaning. 

*** Black Feminist Thinking and New Materialisms
Writers in Black Studies have been revising New Materialisms, reorient
discussions on materiality away from white masculinist perspectives
and celebrating a lineage of marginalized thinkers
**** The Flesh, Subjectivity, Desire by Brown, Musser, Snorton
My question here: is there pleasure in the sensation that transcends
the boundaries of the subject? I’m thinking of Musser’s point about
how sexual desire is produced by violence and pleasure together, and
that “To think with the flesh and to inhabit the pornotrope is to hold
violence and possibility in the same frame” (Musser 12). It seems that
some kind of violence---the violence of marking the subject---is
necessary in the experience of flesh and pleasure.

“Flesh… is free of the need for subjectivity. I contend that there is
freedom in the flesh, in the moments when it is excluded from being
marked, as it feels, and responds to, touch” (Brown B11).

The idea that sexuality (sexual desire) is irreparably produced by
violence and pleasure, that they are both contained within the
pornotrope. 

And additionally, that there is this contradiction (or paradox?)
within desire, which is between possession and dissolution---desire is
about a sovereign subject attempting to possess another, this is the
drive or impulse of desire; but at the same time, at the height of
desire, its ultimate goal, is about dissolution, about the melting
away of the subject. What if we reconceptualize desire as the impulse
to possess or dissolve, but without a subject?

Also snorton’s transcapable.

**** confusion on the flesh - engaging Lorde with Snorton/Musser
The misalignment between the pornographic in Lorde and the pornotropic
in Snorton/Musser. 

 If the pornographic is just flesh, just pure sensation, how do we
 build an erotics out of it? 

 Flesh (Snorton) is supposed to be this thing which eludes capture,
 but at the same time creates possibility. Snorton seems to suggest
 that we can get at resistance through the reduction to flesh, in the
 concept of the “transcapable”. That the pornotrope suggests a state
 of chaos which can resist the fixity of gender. 

 I wonder what Audre Lorde might say to this? Maybe that yes, the
 flesh represents a state of possibility. But not in its vacuity,
 rather, in the potential for depth of feeling. Looking at the flesh
 for it’s erotic potential rather than the pornographic which is
 imposed upon it.
 
**** Humanity
Folks from afam studies, like Jackson and Brown, are reconceptualizing
the human to go beyond the confines of the body, into ecology,
environment, via affective registers. 

Connect to Hayles's work (?)
