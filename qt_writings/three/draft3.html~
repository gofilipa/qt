This chapter looks at the materiality of digital media by harnessing
concepts of the flesh as developed in black feminsist studies. 
</p>

<p>
First, I open a discussion on the role of agency in ethics from
Octavia Butler's novel, <i>Dawn</i>, which is about an alien colonization
of earth and humanity. Here, I examine the process by which the aliens
use sexual pleasure to placate the humans and even compel them to
interbreed with the aliens. The aliens stimulate pleasure by direct
neural contact, which is faciliated by an intermediary being whose
"sensory arms" connect directly to the brain's pleasure centers. By
bypassing the flesh, this method of intercourse dissolves the binary
between self and other&#x2013;the foundation for possessive
individualism&#x2013;as well as sense and thought. Drawing from thinkers in
Chicanx Studies and Black Feminist Studies, I argue that this method
creates an ethics based on pleasure rather than choice or consent.
</p>

<p>
Then, I examine more closely the intersection between sense and
thought, turning to the materiality of the flesh, as it as been
theorized in Black Feminist Studies. Here, I examine how the concept
of the Pornotrope, that is the reduction of body to flesh, of the
conceptual (body) to the material (flesh), creates a ground for new
theorizations of meaning and materiality. Specifically, this reduction
of Body to Flesh offers a model of resistance to racial exploitation
that reinforces sensuality and pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
This in turn allows me to do a media archaeology of a hypertext
fiction work, a digital series by Entropy8Zuper! entitled
<i>skinonskinonskin</i> (1999). Here, I bring the theorizations about
pleasure and the Flesh to bear on an interface that obscures its
material components and construction. I trace the complicated stack of
hardware and software that facilitate the display and preservation of
this work, examining various technologies that work in tandem such as
internet networks, hypertext, and Flash technology. These technologies
together enable me to explore how <i>skinonskinonskin</i>'s interface
engages the intersection between the digital and analog registers
undergirding its components.

This paper juxtaposes two unlikely texts&#x2013;an early hypertext work from
1999, and a science fiction novel from 1987&#x2013;to unpack the role of
“media” across physiological and technological systems. The early
hypertext work, skinonskinonskin, written collectively by the
artist-couple known as Entropy8Zuper!, explores
electronically-mediated desire through a series of digital love poems
that combine hypertext, audio, and Flash media technology. Moving from
digital to embodied desire, the science fiction novel, Dawn by Octavia
Butler, poses a post-apocalyptic scenario where humans find themselves
coerced into sex and procreation with extraterrestrial colonizers. In
these couplings, sexual contact is routed through an alien
intermediary, whose ability to plug directly into the human brain’s
pleasure centers intensifies their sexual instincts into all but
irresistible compulsions. Though Butler’s novel and skinonskinonskin
present vastly different narrative worlds and physical formats, I’m
interested in how both texts explore the mediation of pleasure, in one
case technological, through computer hardware and software, and in
another physiological, through nervous systems and brain chemistry.
</p>

<p>
My analysis reads for sensual pleasure across the medial environments
in each text. In Butler’s novel, I examine how human flesh&#x2013;the
traditional site for sexual contact between two partners&#x2013;is bypassed
for direct neural stimulation facilitated by the third sexual partner,
the alien intermediary. Because this direct neural connection
scrambles traditional distinctions between the body and mind, during
the sex act, the humans have trouble differentiating their embodied
feelings from their cognitive interpretations. The alien colonizers,
who describe themselves as “gene traders,” exploit this human
susceptibility to sexual pleasure in order to interbreed with them. To
better understand the compulsions of pleasure and the flesh, I engage
Black Feminist Studies’ theorizing on the flesh. According to critics
like Hortense Spillers, C. Riley Snorton, and Amber Jamilla Musser,
the systematic reduction of the Black body to the physical flesh, a
process that began during the violences and atrocities of the Middle
Passage, creates an opportunity for rethinking the political potential
of pleasure and eroticism. In my analysis, this concept of the flesh
becomes a ground for understanding how physical registers interact
with symbolic ones, which offers an analogue for thinking through
media in technological contexts. Turning to skinonskinonskin, I
examine the hardware and software formats that facilitate the display
and preservation of this work, tracing the complicated stack of
technologies, which include internet networks, web tools, Flash media,
and more recently, a computer system Emulator. Borrowing from Media
Archaeology and Network Studies, I take a close look at what Matt
Kirschenbaum describes as the “formal” level of materiality, or the
effects on the screen, moving down the layers of abstraction, through
the compiled code of Flash media, into the level of hardware, what he
calls the “forensic materiality,” of the internet network. Bringing
the sensibility of the flesh in Black Feminist Studies to bear in this
electronic environment, I explore the quality of vulnerability
inherent in network contact, as theorized by Wendy Chun, Alexander
Galloway, and Eugene Thacker. Here, I am interested in how contact
between nodes necessitates a level of openness and exposure, and how
this susceptibility to touch relates back to notions of the flesh. My
goal is to examine the material qualities of the medium&#x2013;be it
technical or physiological&#x2013;for the ways it offers a kind of capacious
mode for theorizing new forms of collectivity.  
</p>

<p>
As Kirschenbaum argues, “Digital inscription is a form of
displacement. Its fundamental characteristic is to remove digital
objects from the channels of direct human intervention” (Kirschenbaum
86). As a result of this displacement, scholarship about electronic
media generally focuses on conceptual or abstract levels of media,
such as the effects of interface and visual design, and only
occasionally considers logical structures like data formats and
programming languages, and even less frequently, the material
realities of hardware and networks. Pushing against this tendency, the
bulk of this presentation will comprise what N. Katherine Hayles calls
a “media-specific analysis” (Hayles 107). With Butler’s novel
situating my discussion on mediation, I will parse out the levels of
formal and forensic materiality in the technological stack that makes
up skinonskinonskin. Here, I will examine the shifts between digital
formats, such as the levels of compiled code, software applications,
and physical networks necessary to create, present, and preserve Flash
media. I hope that this attention to the physical qualities of
electronic media will pose new possibilities for reframing the way we
understand the role of touch and pleasure in making connections across
various kinds of media.

Octavia Butler's novel, <i>Dawn</i>, published in 1987, is the first book
of a trilogy, initially titled <i>Xenogenesis</i> and more recently,
<i>Lilith's Brood</i>, about humans who must, as a question of survival,
interbreed with extra terrestrial beings. <i>Dawn</i> relates the story of
one family's matriarch, Lilith Iyapo, who is "rescued" from nuclear
war by the extra terrestrials, the Oankali. The story begins with
Lilith waking up in a prison cell on the Oankali spaceship, where she
soon finds out that the humanity has been all but extinguished and
that the Oankali intend to reproduce with the remaining
survivors. Then, over the next several pages, it becomes clear what
the Oankali want Lilith to do: to shepherd a group of humans to accept
the dissolution of humanity as they know it. This dissolution takes
the form of genetic manipulation, where by interbreeding with the
humans, what the Oankali call the "gene trade," will yield a new,
hybrid race. As the "Judas goat" who leads the sheep to slaughter,
Lilith must convince the humans to accept a fate whose implications
she cannot bear: that humanity will become something profoundly
different from what it is; that their children will look not quite
human, what but what she describes "Medusa children" (Butler 87).
</p>

<p>
Lilith's aversion to the prospect of humanity changing signals a deep
predicament which she and other humans will struggle against for the
rest of the series. Like other of Butler's work, this novel explores
the paradox that humanity must fundamentally change in order to
survive. Speaking of the <i>Parable</i> novels, which also depict the
events following societal collapse, Jayna Brown explains that, for
humanity, "changing and prevailing cannot coexist&#x2026; We must adapt to
survive, but species are never stable over time if they successfully
adapt" (Brown 94). Throughout the novel, Lilith toes the line of this
paradox, simultaneously encouraging the humans to obey the aliens'
directions while preparing them for escape, encouraging them to "learn
and run."  Nonetheless, for more than a few humans in her group, she
represents acquiesence to their new captors, and becomes a recepticle
for their anger and resistance to colonization. Despite the Oankali's
promise of long, healthy lives for their human mates, it is difficult
for the humans to take their advances as promising anything but
annihilation.
</p>

<p>
One reason that humans cannot accept the gene trade can be attributed
to their own genetics which contain, in the words of the Oankali
themselves, the "human contradiction." As explained by Jhdaya, the
first Oankali that Lilith meets, humans have two characteristics that
once enabled humanitity to survive but now threaten the future of the
species:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"You are intelligent," he said. "That's the newer of the two
characteristics, and the one you might have put to work to save
yourselves. You are potentially one of the most intelligent species
we've found, though your focus is different from ours. Still, you had
a good start in the life sciences, and even in genetics."
</p>

<p>
"What's the second characteristic?  
</p>

<p>
"You are hierarchical. That's the older and more entrenched
characteristic. We saw it in your closest animal relatives and in your
most distant ones. It's a terrestrial characteristic. When human
intelligence served it instead of guiding it, when human intelligence
did not even acknowledge it as a problem, but took pride in it or did
not notice it at all. . ." [&#x2026;] "That was like ignoring cancer. I
think your people did not realize what a dangerous thing they were
doing."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The tendency toward hierarchy, as a "terrestrial" characteristic, is
ingrained in all humans. The impulse to stratify people, to create
social groupings, even to colonize and oppress, descends from an
ancient instinct that once served to sustain, protect, and organize
early human tribes. But when the hierarchical instinct grows unchecked
into the modern world, Jdhaya explains, it becomes dangerous, like a
cancer. The problem, which the book returns to again and again, is
that humanity will not overcome something which is ingrained into
their DNA. Brown points out that, "If survival is based on a
competitive struggle for existence, then how can humans ever overcome
what they are biologically wired to do?  How can humans change <i>and</i>
stay the same?"  (Brown 98-99).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-2">
<p>
The social problems that emerge from this hierarchical impulse are
those that precipitate and perpetuate systemic
inequalities. Stratifications between gender, race, nationality, and
class, for example, descend from this very foundational tendency to
mark and divide what is different, what is other, from what is
familiar. This novel explores how such a tendency, deeply ingrained in
human nature, comes to the fore even as it is threatened by aliens who
intend to "fix" the human contradiction through gene manipulation in
interbreeding. The tendency to self-organize appears early on, when
the humans are being woken up from suspended animation in order to
prepare and train for survival. Upon waking, the humans almost
instantly pair off in male-female couples that end up sustaining
themselves throughout the story. The pressure to couple brings a
remnant of human society into the strange, alien spaceship which
offers some form of stability for the survivors. When one woman
hesitates to choose a man, a violent confrontation ensues. One of the
women involved demands: "What the hell is she saving herself
for?&#x2026; It's her duty to get together with someone. There aren't that
many of us left" (335). The stratifications that the hierarchical
tendency engenders grows as the humans become more desperate in their
resistance against the Oankali colonization. In particular, certain
men, like Peter and Curt for example, grow more and more agitated at
their captivity and eventually attack Lilith and her followers, who
they regard as responsible, with deadly force.

<li><a id="org2ab1488"></a>fear of the unknown<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-3">
<p>
One of the implications of the human contradiction is how the
hierarchical tendency works in tandem with the propensity for
intelligence to create a fear of the other. Early in the story, this
fear is established as a stubborn and innate human trait. To wade
through this fear, familiar categories and concepts are often imposed
onto foreign phenomena. This is why, when she first sees her captives,
Lilith processes the alien body in human terms:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The lights brightened as she had supposed they would, and what had
seemed to be a tall, slender man was still humanoid, but it had no
nose&#x2013;no bulge, no nostrils&#x2013;just flat, gray skin. It was gray all
over&#x2013;pale gray skin, darker gray hair on its head that grew down
around its eyes and ears and at its throat. There was so much hair
across the eyes that she wondered how the creature could see. The
long, profuse ear hair seemed to grow out of the ears as well as
around them. Above, it joined the eye hair, and below and behind, it
joined the head hair. The island of throat hair seemed to move
slightly, and it occurred to her that that might be where the creature
breathed&#x2013;a kind of natural tracheostomy.
</p>

<p>
Lilith glanced at the humanoid body, wondering how humanlike it really
was. "I don't mean any offense," she said, "but are you male or
female?"
</p>

<p>
"It's wrong to assume that I must be a sex you're familiar with," it
said, "but as it happens, I'm male."
</p>

<p>
Good. It could become 'he' again. Less awkward. 29
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Lilith initially describes the alien's features by cataloging a
"nose," "hair," "eyes," "ears," and "throat," though he has no such
organs, and the first question she asks is to inquire him of his
sex. These responses illustrate the strength of the instict to
interpret bodily appearances according to pre-existing anatomical
categories. Although Jdhaya points out Lilith's mistake in making
assumptions about gender, she nonetheless takes some comfort from
being able to call Jdhaya a "he."
</p>

<p>
When, however, the strangeness of the alien's appearance proceeds the
terms available to her, she immediatley turns to what would likely be
read as a fear of the other:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
She did not want to be any closer to him. She had not known what held
her back before. Now she was certain it was his alienness, his
difference, his literal unearthliness. She found herself still unable
to take even one more step toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh god," she whispered. And the hair&#x2013;the
whatever&#x2013;it-was&#x2013;moved. Some of it seemed to blow toward her as
though in a wind, though there was no stirring of air in the room.
</p>

<p>
She frowned, strained to see, to understand. Then, abruptly, she did
understand. She backed away, scrambled around the bed and to the far
wall. When she could go no farther, she stood against the wall,
staring at him.
</p>

<p>
Medusa. 30
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The narration in this passage suggests a process as Lilith attempts to
place the alien into pre-existing categories. First, when the truth of
his total alienness begins to register, it occurs in a pre-linguistic,
embodied level. It begins with an intense aversion toward physical
proximity&#x2013;"She found herself unable to take even one more step toward
him" (29-30). Then, when she examines his "features," she still
struggles to process his physical composition until she finally,
"abruptly&#x2026; understand[s]," and her impulse is to move away. Her
encounter with Jhdaya's unknown alien form demonstrates an aversion
through terms of body language. Then, the narration moves from
depicting body language to description through figuration, an
evocation of the mythical figure "Medusa." Here, Lilith's subscribes
the unknown in terms of something that is, ableit in the context of
myth and fantasy, familiar to the human imaginary. The narration in
this passage, which builds from instinctual body movement to
imagination, reinforces the processes that humans undergo when
encountering the unknown. The tendency toward hierarchy demands that
she place this being on a scale of familiarity, comparing him to what
she already knows about other living beings, for example, that Jhadaya
is male. However, the hierarchy fails to subsume his other qualities,
the sensory organs, intelligence steps in to create an analogy, and
her mind makes the leap between what she sees and what she already
knows. The two sides of the contradiction, hierarchy and intelligence,
work together here to engender a sense of all-consuming fear of the
other.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org38e24b7"></a>is actually fear of <i>feeling</i> the similar<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-4">
<p>
The comparison to Medusa, however, demonstrates that the fear of the
other is based not on the unknown, but on the known. Lilith's use of
similitude evokes a point that Cherrie Moraga, Chicana feminist
activist and writer, argues that the cause of racial fear is not the
totally foreign, but a similarity that the subject percieves in the
other, despite their difference. In her influential essay, "La Guera"
[The White Girl], Moraga explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
it is not really difference the oppressor fears so much as
similarity. He fears he will discover in himself the same aches, the
same longings as those of the people he has shitted on. He fears the
immobilization threatened by his own incipient guilt. He fears he will
have to change his life once he has seen himself in the bodies of the
people he has called different. He fears the hatred, anger, and
vengeance of those he has hurt. 32
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For Moraga, similarity is the foundation on which fear of the other is
built. This similarity is apparent in Lilith's use of the "Medusa"
comparison, and marks the moment when the subject, which can find no
expression beyond body language, finally settles on a familiar
designation, relating the unknown to a form within the human
imaginary. Despite his alienness, at that point, Jhadaya becomes
incorporated into an anthropocentric worldview. This process is about
finding similarity in difference as it is being felt, in the form of
"aches" and "longings." Who has lighter skin and more education than
most in her Latino, working-class background, describes how her
lesbianism unlocked the workings racial and class oppression. Moraga
explains that "[her] lesbianism is the avenue through which I have
learned the most about silence and oppression, and it continues to be
the most tactile reminder to me that we are not free human beings"
(28-29).

<li><a id="orgd46e900"></a>sensuality a (difficult) method of human interconnection<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-5">
<p>
For Moraga, the body is both the central obstacle and the solution for
achieving interpersonal connection with the other. To overcome the
fear of the other, it is necessary to come to terms with similarity in
the body coded different&#x2013;by race, gender, class, disability. This
occurs in a process by which one opens one's body, particularly
sensastions, oneself to full accounting of oppression:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this country, lesbianism is a poverty&#x2013;as is being brown, as is
being a woman, as is being just plain poor. The danger lies in ranking
the oppressions. <i>The danger lies in failing to acknowledge the
specificity of the oppression</i>. The danger lies in attempting to deal
with oppression purely from a theoretical base. Without an emotional,
heartfelt grappling with the source of our own oppression, without
naming the enemy within ourselves and outside of us, no authentic,
non-hierarchical connection among oppressed groups can take
place. Emphasis original, 29
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As Moraga explains, one must not only acknowledge the existence of
others' oppression, but come to terms with the oppression's
specificity, a process which involves looking within the self to
experience its physical, sensual components, what she calls "an
emotional, heartfelt grappling" of one's own oppression. Moraga's
argument, which is an intersectional Feminist response to the identity
politics of second-wave feminism, offers a model for interpersonal
understanding while keeping the specificity of oppression local and
situated, which is to say in some way unknowable or
un-essentializable. The power of this kind of connection comes from
its incompletion, its partiality, its lack of fulfillment. 
</p>

<p>
Other Chicana and Latin American theorists, like Ofelia Schutte and
Norma Alarcon, discusses another side of the process of overcoming
difference in communication. Ofelia Schutte, for example, explores the
possibilities for "cross-cultural communication," specifically, the
question of "how to speak to the 'other' who is different from
oneself" (Schutte 53). Schutte's strategy is to emphasize attention to
what she calls "incommensurability," that is, the "residue of meaning
that will not be reached in cross-cultural endeavors"
(56). Incommensurability refers to the quality that is lost in
translation, so to speak, when members from two cultures interact. In
order to tap into incommensurability, Schutte explains, interlocutors
might attend to moments when the other's speech "resonates in [one] as
a kind of strangeness, a kind of dsiplacement of the usual
expectation" (Schutte 56). The point here is to not subsume that
quality of strangeness in the other into familiar structures of
knowledge, like the way that Lilith subsumes Jhadaya's strangeness
into the similitude of the terrifying Medusa. Rather, the point is to
sustain the feelings of difference without trying to incorporate them
into pre-existing (dominant) modes of thought. Norma Alarcon makes a
similar point in her argument about the dangers of "ontologiz[ing]
difference," that is, of subsuming specific difference into a
universal identity politics. She explains that,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The desire to translate as totalizing metphorical substitution without
acknowledging the "identity-in-difference," so that one's own system
of signification is not disrupted through a historical concept whose
site of emergence is implicated in our own history, may be viewed as
a desire to dominate, constrain, and contain. 133 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The challenge, according to Schutte and Alarcon, is to achieve
connection without totally subsuming the other into totalizing and
therefore oppressive paradigms of subjectivity. One potential
solution, as Schutte and Moraga exemplify, is to attend to the
feelings of the body, of both the "emotional, heartfelt grappling"
within the self <i>and</i> the "incommensurability" of the other, which
seeks to feel without attempting to recodify.
</p>

<p>
For most humans, who are bound and determined by their biological
impulses and social conditioning, this process is nearly
impossible. It is only through significant effort and supra-human
capabilities that Lilith herself is able to move beyond her fear of
the Oankali. Crucially, this novel refrains from offering an easy
solution to the problem of xenophobia that accompanies the innate
human characteristic of hierarchy. Rather, it explores how
hierarchical human nature might engage with an alternative, even
antithetical social paradigm, that is, social collectivism. The
novel's proposal for this new form of social organization comes down
to Oankali anatomy and their sense organs, which enable direct
connection between themselves and their human partners. Connection
between the Oankali is based the immediate sharing of feelings,
sensations, and thoughts through the neural linkage enabled by their
sensory organs, in particular, their "sensory hands" which they use
for gene manipulation and sex. By connected to each other's bodies and
minds, the Oankali have no need for deceoption or even memory, for
they are compelled to share experiences directly. This form of
collectivism enables the novel to explore new alternatives for
collectivism based on mutual sensation, in particular, through
pleasure. It offers the human-Oankali couplings allow for a
reconsideration of the role of agency in ethics.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org7c1fff8"></a>acquisitiveness leads to collectivity, refiguring ethics<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-6">
<p>
It is important to situate, however, Oankali collectivism within their
own innate tendencies as a colonizing, alien species. For the Oankali,
ther deepest instinct is to acquire new species for their "gene
trade." Jhadaya explains: "We acquire new life, seek it, investigate
it, manipulate it, sort it, use it. We carry the drive to do this in a
minuscule cell within a cell, a tiny organelle within every cell of
our bodies" (84). The Oankali compulsion to acquire may seem to have
some similarities with the human drive for hierarchy, in particular,
that it requires taking in and incorporating new beings into an
existing structure. However, there is a crucial difference between the
Oankali and the humans, which has to do with the collective nature of
the alien species. One of the Oankali children, Nikanj, explains to
Lilith that they evolved from a life form that consisted of numerous
interconnected beings: "'Six divisions ago, on a white-sun water
world, we lived in great shallow oceans,' it said. 'We were
many-bodied and spoke with body lights and color patterns among
ourself and among ourselves'" (123). From their "many-bodied"
ancestors, the current Oankali inheirited a constitution of
collective, rather than individual, consciousness, which affects their
concept of agency. As the Oankali evolved, this collective nature
affects the way they communicate, which is by sharing sensory
information directly so that the interlocutor experiences what is
being related to them, and the way they make decisions, which is by
unanimous agreement. Agency is distributed among the beings, who are
singular and plural at once, "ourself and ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Their method of acquisition, though arguably similar to human acts of
colonization in the way they expand through incorporation, presents a
drastically different understanding of ethical relationships. Because
health and vitality are necessary in order to trade genes, the Oankali
do not admit any form of harm or desctruction of life. At several
points in the book, this attachment to life becomes a blind spot,
preventing them from anticipating acts of violence and at one point,
even death, by humans. Toward the end of the novel, Lilith's partner,
Joseph, is killed by a group of humans who rebel and attempt to escape
the Oankali. Soon after his murder, Nikanj uses Joseph's genetic
material to impregnate Lilith without her knowledge. Nikanj explains
to Lilith that it gives her what she truly wants, though she cannot
admit it,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"You'll have a daughter," it said. "And you are ready to be her
mother. You could never have said so. Just as Joseph could never have
invited me into his bed&#x2013;no matter how much he wanted me
there. Nothing about you but your words reject this child." 468-9.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nikanj's explanation here reformulates the question of agency from
conscious acknowledgement ("You could never have said so") into
subconcious desire. For the Oankali, pleasure is the principal factor
for decision-making. For, unlike humans, Oankali lack the capacity to
self-delude through language. When Lilith protests that "It won't be
human," Nikanj points out the facts: "You shouldn't begin to lie to
yourself. It's a deadly habit. The child will be yours and Joseph's"
(469). Nikanj's reasoning is simple: no matter what she says, it knows
she will love and accept the child. The collective nature of the
Oankali prioritizes pleasure, in this case pleasure tied both to
concieving a child and mothering a child, over what the organism says
or thinks. The question of agency, and therefore what counts as
coercion and manipulation, depends on pleasure rather than individual
choice, which has significant implications for ethics.

</li>

<li><a id="org4c0fea7"></a>Flesh as interface scrambling sense/thought registers<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-7">
<p>
One of the consequnces of the Oankali focus on pleasure as a
foundation for ethics may seem perhaps paradoxical from a human
perspective. The method that Oankali have sex dispenses with what is
for humans the source of sexual pleasure&#x2013;the flesh. Flesh, which is
the means through which humans achieve sexual contact, is an obstacle
for Oankali sex. In the Oankali sexual union, the male and female do
not touch, but are rather routed through an intermediary, nonbinary
being whose "sensory arms" plug directly into into the brain. The
ooloi intermediary dispenses not only with the clumsiness of human
bodies and the flesh, but also with human modes of communication and
intimacy, to achieve direct stimulation of the brain's pleasure
centers. In the process of seducing Joseph, Nikanj explains that it
"offer[s] a oneness that your people strive for, dream of, but can't
truly attain alone" (359). The direct connection facilitated by the
ooloi offers a sensual and cognitive experience which cannot be
paralleled by physical intercourse. Once Nikanj has her "plugged in",
Lilith
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
immediately recieved Joseph as a blanket of warmth and security, a
compelling, steadying presence. 
</p>

<p>
She never knew whether she was receiving Nikanj's approximation of
Joseph, a true transmission of what Joseph was feeling, some
combination of truth and approximation, or just a pleasant fiction. 
</p>

<p>
What was Joseph feeling from her?
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her that she had always been with him. She had no
sensation of shifting gears, no "time alone" to contrast with the
present "time together." He had always been there, part of her,
essential. 
</p>

<p>
Nikanj focused on the intensity of their attraction, their union. It
left Lilith no other sensation. It seemed, itself, to vanish. She
sensed only Joseph, felt that he was aware only of her. 
</p>

<p>
Now their delight in one another ignited and burned. They moved
together, sustaining an impossible intensity, both of them tireless,
perfectly matched, ablaze in sensation, lost in one another. 308-309
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While Lilith's experience of sex with Joseph and Nikanj explains a lot
about the relationship between physical pleasure and mental
experience, it also instructs one crucial lesson about human
relationships. That Lilith questions whether her mental experiences
are true or not, the fact that she doubts, points to an issue with
human intimacy&#x2013;that there is exists a gap for miscommunication and
misunderstanding. This gap is created and sustained by the flesh,
which can be a clumsy, cumbersome, and unreliable space through which
two sexual partners must navigate to reach sexual unity. By contrast,
the Oankali sexual experience bypasses this gap directly, plugging
into the brain's pleasure centers. By routing sensual connection to
the brain, they eliminate the space for discomfort and even repulsion
which can occur when in flesh-to-flesh contact.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org396d7ce"></a>first implication: materiality inexctricable from mind<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-8">
<p>
The elimination of flesh in sex reveals a complex imbrication between
physical sensation and mental experience, which pushes against a
tendency in narratives that feature the "posthuman," that is, figures
who extend the bounds of the traditional human subject by
technological, biological, or spiritual modification. Because the
sexual experience occurs entirely in the brain, it is easy to assume,
as Lilith and Joseph do, that the experience is a simulation. Their
assumption perpetuates one crucial tenet of liberal human
subjectivity, according to N. Katherine Hayles, that the rational mind
<i>possess</i> a fleshy body which functions as an extension of the
mind. Hayles explains that for the posthuman, the mind represents pure
intelligence, a set of informational patterns, while the body
functions as a sort of prosthesis, which can be substituted, updated,
or even removed from the intelligent mind. The classic example is
William Gibson's <i>Neuromancer</i> novel, which poses a a virtual
"dataspace," known as a "matrix," where users can move and interact
without the need of a physical body. This emphasis on cognition
creates an "erasure of embodiment" which assumes that feelings and
sensations that occur in the body can be experienced in a flesh-less
environment (Hayles 4-5). In the novel, Lilith appears to make the
same assumptions as the posthuman when she questions whether the
feelings she recieves from Joseph are "true." However, as her
conversation with Nikanj develops, she brings the body back into
consideration:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"He&#x2026; felt everything I felt?"
"On a sensory level. Intellectually, he made his interpretations and
you made yours.
"I wouldn't call them intellectual." 310-311
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Lilith's response here indicates that sense and thought are not as
distinct as might have been assumed, in Hayles words, that "abstract
pattern can never fully capture the embodied actuality" (22).Indeed,
during the sex act, the terms that she uses to describe their sexual
union appear to blend feeling and thought. The physical "warmth" with
which she receives Joseph is immediately augmented with mental
interpretations of "security," that is, comfort and
protection. Further on, the intensity of their connection appears not
only to dissolve her sense of time, as she feels "she had always been
with him," but also to intuit what he was feeling, "that he was aware
only of her" (308). While sex with the Oankali focuses on physical
pleasure, the mind builds mental interpretations that seem to be
inextricable from physical sensation.

sleeping comfortably against her many times. She did not pretend
outwardly or to herself that she would resist Nikanj’s invitation—or

Joseph that was beyond ordinary human experience. And what it gave, it

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
This inexctricability of physical sensation from mental interpretation
has an analogue in the way that C. Riley Snorton describes as
"unmappability." Here, Snorton reads the material qualities of a
daguerrotype, an early method of photography:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To view a daguerreotype is to look at an image that does not sit on a
surface but appears to be floating in space. Rather than an antiquated
form of modern photography, as Foucault’s characterization implies,
the daguerreotype provides a series of lessons about power, and racial
power in particular, as a form in which an image takes on myriad
perspectives because of the interplay of light and dark, both in the
composition of the shot and in the play of light on the display. That
the image does not reside on the surface but floats in an unmappable
elsewhere offers an allegory for race as a procedure that exceeds the
logics of a bodily surface, occuring by way of flesh, a racial
mattering that appears through puncture in the form of a wound or
covered by skin and screened from view. 40
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The format of the dagguereotype evokes the method by which meaning is
stripped then reapplied to flesh that, for captive bodies, "functioned
as a disarticulation of human form from its anatomical features"
(18). The physical material of the image, that is the silvered copper
plate of the daguerreotype, at once solidifies its ground and indexes
an ambiguous space, what Snorton describes as the "unmappable
elsewhere" which swells to obscure while containing the evidence of
racial significations. Snorton's curious use of the word "puncture"
here recalls Roland Barthes's concept of the "punctum," which indexes
the experience of being pierced by a detail of the photograph (<i>Camera
Lucida</i> 27). Opposed to the concept of the <i>studium</i>, which represents
the dominant historical, social, or cultural meaning portrayed within
and by the photograph, the <i>punctum</i> is the "sting, speck, cut, little
hole&#x2026; that accident which pricks me (but also buises me, is poignant
to me)" (Barthes <i>Camera Lucida</i> 27-28). Barthes explains that,
"However lightning-like it may be, the <i>punctum</i> has, more or less
potentially, the power of expansion. This power is often metonymic"
(<i>Camera Lucida</i> 45). For Barthes, the <i>punctum</i> is that detail of a
photograph which at once pierces the viewer and suggests an expansion,
an effect which is exagerrated in erotic photographs, where the
<i>punctum</i>, "is a kind of subtle <i>beyond</i>&#x2013;as if the image launched
desire beyond what it permits us to see" (59). Barthes's theorization
of the <i>punctum</i> allows us to see how the flesh can be at once a
<i>mattering</i>, a becoming matter, and an accumulation of meaning, which
in simulteneity, has the effect peirces the viewer. We cannot, as
Snorton points out, locate the image at a specific point on the
copper-plate is essential, though we can feel its puncture. That the
image cannot be traced back to a single location, yet is contained and
signifies within that physical space, is crucial for undersanding the
way that the physical registers interact with symbolic ones. The
meeting between this liminal space of the image's meanings and its
silver-plated copper ground offers a means for thinking through the
collision of two registers, of flesh against gender &amp; race.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orga1f16e5"></a>transition: concept of flesh to understand the gap<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-3-2-1">
<p>
This inextricability of the material from the mental is the key for
understanding how social relations might develop toward more ethically
equitable forms. To help unpack this inexctricability, I turn to
thinkers in Black Feminist Studies like Hortense Spillers, C. Riley
Snorton, and Amber Musser, and their theories of the "flesh." For
these thinkers, the concept of the flesh enables them to parse various
racial and gendered processes ascribed to Black bodies over time, the
"symbolic order" or "American grammar," in Spillers words (68). The
physical materiality of the flesh, which indexes a liminal space where
meaning is simultaneously ascribed and obscured, functions a solid
ground for thinking through the intersection of materiality and
meaning. Their theorizing of the flesh allows me to trace in more
detail how the process of reduction, such as the reduction of body to

us to consider, from another perspective, the intersection of the

<p>
In the nearly impossible task of accounting of the egregious yet
overlooked of horrors of transatlantic slavery, thinkers in Black
Feminist Studies have flipped the reduction of the body to flesh from
a tool of subjectification to one of (not unproblematic)
empowerment. The idea of black flesh as a reduction of the black body
is first theorized by Hortense Spillers in her influential essay,
"Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe: An American Grammar Book." Here Spillers
puts forth the conception of the black body as a stack of "attentuated
meanings, made in excess over time, assigned by a particular
historical order" (65). These meanings developed from the body that
had been reduced to flesh, a violent process, "severing of the captive
body from its motive will," that Spillers traces to the middle passage
and has four effects (67):
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the captive body becomes the source of an irresistible, destructive
sensuality;</li>
<li>at the same time- in stunning contradiction - the captive body
reduces to a thing, becoming being for the captor;</li>
<li>in this absence from a subject position, the captured sexualities
provide a physical and biological expression of "otherness";</li>
<li>as a category of "otherness," the captive body translates into a
potential for pornotroping and embodies sheer physical
powerlessness that slides into a more general "powerlessness,"
resonating through various centers of human and social meaning. 67</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Imposed by the reduction of bodies to bare physicality, to a material
substance, there is, in "stunning contradiction," some form
of meaning aheres to the flesh, a potential combination of sensuality,
objectificaiton, otherness, and powerlessness (Spillers 67).
</p>

<p>
The black flesh, "await[ing] whatever marvels of&#x2026; inventiveness,"
has been attended more recently by black feminist theorists such as
Snorton and Amber Musser (Spillers 65). For his "black and trans
historiographical project," Snorton demonstrates flesh as the physical
and malleable material that enables the construction of social
categories like race and gender. Similar to scholars of slavery's
archive like Saidiya Hartman, Snorton's method takes the details of
the archival record as "conditions of possibility" in his study, and
reads for hints of resistance contained within the dominant narrative
that suggest the ommitted, obscured, or elided experience of black
subjects (Snorton 11). This methodology uses the critical imagination
to read into what Hartman and others call "the violence of the
archive," a violence not only in the form of evidence, that the
records literally obscure or overlook information, but also in the
tools of expression, in the language that cannot approximate
experience, and in the discourse that dictates silence (2). Like
"Critical fabulation," Snorton's reading of archival material draws
narrative from the gaps and lacunae of the evidence, working to
"expose and exploit the incommensurability between the experience of
the enslaved and the fictions of history" (Hartman 10). One example
concerns a slave woman, Anarcha, whose severe case of Vaginal Fistula
made her an object of medical experimentation. Because the record that
hardly mentions her by name (when it does not misname her) is silent
about her experience of what certainly were painful and prolonged
surgeries without anesthetics, Snorton turns to seemingly minor
details like smell and the presence of other enslaved women to
"further imaginative capacities" for reading resistance
(14). Anarcha's reportedly offensive smell, what Snorton calls the
"discourse of disgust," for example, indexes both her subjection to
social hierarchy and her resistance, for "the recurrent descriptors of
Anarcha's body odor provides an opening to imagine what modicums of
protection might have been afforded by smelling noxious to one's
enslaver" (27). Additionally, the banal reality of servitude implies
that other slave women such as Lucy and Betsey (among others who were
unnamed), stood as medical assitants when necessary, which opens
speculation into "modes of nourishment and care" they provided one
another (Snorton 29); In one procedure on Betsey, for example, Snorton
explains that "the opacity in the archive&#x2026; leaves room to imagine
how Betsey might have somehow resisted the performance of stoic
bravery or willing subjectivity that she was compelled to produce"
(25). Following Spillers, who poses flesh as the "zero degree of
social conceptualization", Snorton attends to flesh as a <i>ground</i> for
theorizing enables him to attend to the implications of format and
form in the archive. (Spillers 67).
</p>

<p>
Snorton, for example, demonstrates that the whittling down of black
subjects to the interchangeable, what he calls the "fungible," in
chattel slavery creates a possibility for for "fugitivity," or
escape. His theorizing uses the properties of flesh to trace the
contradictions that produce race and gender, for "Captive and divided
flesh functions as malleable matter for mediating and remaking sex and
gender as matters of human categorization and personal definition"
(20). To demonstrate the imbrication between sex, race, and black
flesh, Snorton examines how the denial of femininity of black slaves,
whose bodies were used for experimental purposes, enabled the
emergence of field of gynecology as a white women's science. Snorton
explains that, white femininity, which prevents the inspection of
white female genitalia, is constructed out of the "scopic
availability" of black flesh of women (33). Yet, Snorton crucially
asserts, this genderless flesh is also a "capacitating structure"
which enables "fungibility for fugitive movement" (53). Here, Snorton
interweaves various narratives of fugitivity, such as that of Harriet
Jacobs, who escaped slavery in 1842 and subsequently wrote <i>Incidents
in the Life of a Slave Girl</i> (1861). Snorton points out that, while
traditional racial "passing" assumes white passing, it is blackness
which gives one the "gender indefiniteness" to enable "cross-gendered
modes of escape" (56). The "blackening" of Jacobs, for example,
allowed her to obtain a level of "fungibility, thingness" that
precluded her recognition (Snorton 71).

This method is about <i>taking what has been a method of reduction</i>,
what has been a tool for appropriating the complexity of real world
objects for the purpose of exploitation, and using that <i>to instead
seek out moments of illegibility</i>, opacity. To multiply rather than
resolve meaning.
</p>

<p>
Snorton explains that the materiality of a daguerreotype suggests "a
visual grammar for reading the imbrications of 'race' and 'gender'
under captivity" (40). In the daguerrotype, the surface becomes the
ground. The traditional (presumptive) way of reading is to guess
what's under the surface. Not this way, which is about seeing surface
as ground for what can be put on top of it.
</p>

<p>
Amber Jamilla Musser runs with the notion of unmappability to theorize
surface aesthetics in her conception of <i>brown jouissance</i>. Like
Snorton, Musser develops her ideas alongside a reading of photograph
technology, in this case, from a photograph of the artist Lyle
Harris's "citation" of Billie Holiday. Musser's reading of the
photograph theorizes the way that escapability emerges from the
superfical, the surface of this image, in its "shine" revealing a self
that is excessive yet inaccessible. Musser notes the details of
Harris's dress, such as the "pearls, eye shadow and lipstick" that
capture the light of the image, as the "Shine [which] plays joyfully
with the idea of the body as body while rejecting the demand to
present anything other than surface" ("Surface-Becoming"
par. 3). Moving beyond the unmappable elsewhere, surface for Musser
not only indexes but <i>forecloses</i> access to that which we cannot know:
She explains, "we can understand surface as the underside of the
scientific/pornographic drive toward locating knowledge in an
'objective' image" ("Surface-Becoming" par. 2). The material of the
surface, which "highlights the mutability of the flesh rather than
interiority," suggests that which escapes its own form (Musser,
"Surface-Becoming" par. 11). While foreclosing the reading of
interiority, the surface aesthetics opens up other considerations,
such as the evocation of hunger in Lyle's open mouth: "sticking with
the surface&#x2013;–through the use of Polaroid and shine–&#x2013;illuminates the
possibilities of imaging a self whose interiority we do not have
plumb, but who still generates creative possibilities for resisting
the mandate of sovereign subjectivity" ("Surface-Becoming"
par. 23). To locate in something physical that which eludes
physicality is a way of resisting (without attempting to recuperate)
the reduction of body to flesh.

For Butler's novel, even when the sex act is apparently contained to
the mind, it is always portrayed as something which relies on the
exigencies and realities of the body. For Lilith, sex is a space where
the compulsions of human drives will overtake logical reasoning. This
leads to new understandings of agency and possession.

potentiality of “flesh” as a site that can avoid the “markings” of

contend that there is freedom in the flesh, in the moments when it
is excluded from being marked, as it feels, and responds to, touch”

As the couple come close to their climax, the immersion in sensation
appears to break down their sense of individual subjectivity: "ablaze

Hayles explains that the ellision of a body within the liberal
humanist framework enables it to slip into further suppressions: "Only
because the body is not identified with the self is it possible to
claim for the liberal subject its notorious universality, a claim that
depends on erasing markers of bodily difference, including sex, race,
and ethnicity" (4-5).

<p>
It's interesting that reason will handicap itself from diagnosing its
own irrationalities. It will explain them away. Why does reason do
this?  Intelligence is largely an operation that orders, organizes,
things. Makes judgements and therefore places things in a
hierarchy. This organization or ordering is inherent to the way that
intelligence works, right? So there is the conflict. Reason can
rationalize hierarchy as a good thing, as an efficient thing.
