** Hardware
*** Macintosh IIci
**** Overview
1989-1993

**** usage
Monitor switch on the back, power switch on the keyboard. Monitor
turns on but computer does not boot up. Turns out it was the power was
not hooked up. When fixed, it booted.

It runs Cyborg well, which is saved on the desktop. But it does not
run the other games saved on the desktop: We Descend and Patchwork
Girl. Nor does it load from their floppies. Patchwork Girl opens and
closes, and We Descend is not recognized by the OS. The OS not
recognize the Marble Springs floppy as well. With Patchwork Girl,
could be in part because the software lisence only allows itself to be
installed on one computer.


*** Amiga 1000
**** Overview
1985-1996
**** usage
Difficult to use. Had to use two disks (Kickstart and Workbench) to
get it going. Different programs are on different disks. Cannot figure
out how to close some windows, but the idea of drawers is
interesting. 

Used TextCraft Plus for some word processing. Was interesting looking,
not many features, but had measured margins. The text wrapping went
off the screen before returning to the next line. Strange.

Need to learn more about how the drawers/screens work and how to use
multiple programs when you just have one drive. For example, when I
put in TextCraft, it asked me for Workbench. 

*** Macintosh SE
**** Overview
1987-1989
Excellent video on the SE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1S2j3TF4bI

**** usage
Marble Springs v.1 is saved here.

I read some of the text and added my own text to the Kenji file, about
his wife who was secretly inspired by the lesbians in Marble Springs
to go off and find her own lover, back in Japan, a princess by the
name of Mononoke. 

I also created some new Storyspace cards within a file called "moon to
Deena". 

*** Apple IIc
**** Overview

1983-1993

There is no hard disk. 

Pressing Control + Reset will launch Basic. ] is the prompt. 

You type your programs into the command line. Programs are saved in
RAM as "list", and you can save them later to the disk. 

   ]List
   ]10 let k=99
   ]15 k = k + 1
   ]20 print k

Screen is Raster graphics, using a Cathode Ray Tube.  

**** usage
Monitor is unresposive. Hear computer whirring and clicking, it
recognizes something is inside the drive, but no response.

*** TRS-80 Model 100
**** Overview

*** Kaypro IV
**** Overview
**** Usage
On startup, the texxt on the screen is a bit shakey. 

Enter "dir" to see the commands. Do not think this worked, but it
returned a list of what appears to be files on the disk ("Wordstar")
which included my name.

Typed in command "WS" to open wordstar, and "D" to open
filename. Again, I see my file from so many years ago, and I edit
it. I also edit the file MITH.

I save and close the file.
