My first chapter explores how gender has been characterized within
discursive frame, in terms of performativity. In that chapter, I
examined how coding structures (the for loop, for example) create
iterative forms which can be reworked toward evoking iterativity in
gender performativity. Here, I want to take a different approach. I
want to examine how Hayles' reading of information as represented on
the computer screen, which she frames as an evacuation of embodiment,
might actually be reframed as a /distinctly material/ and /sensual/
process. I want to consider the ways in which the language on the
computer's screen is only the topmost in a layer of various software
stacks that contain their own materialities.
