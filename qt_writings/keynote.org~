I have some regrets about the way that I did my dissertation. I
foresaw the dissertation being an academic exercise and knew that I
was doing it as a kind of rite of passage. A way of writing, a
practice of weaving together an argument-- it was useful for that. I
did learn how to string many things together, to bring different
frames of thinking into conversation. To do research, to pullee out
pieces, ideas that strike me, to meditate on these with writing, and
string them together. To write!

I think there is something useful about this practice.

But there's a problem with the output: it's not accessible, except
only to a few.

*** april 13
Thank you for having me. I am honored to be here.

I'm going to talk about my experience of doing academic work outside
the traditional research paper. This is something I've been intending
to do as part of my work as a Digital Humanist (a term useful for
labelling, but still doesn't fully describe or encompass the kind of
intervention) Maybe fields--areas of reasearch--ought to be based on
the kind of intervention that you're making.

So I'm going to speak about my experience at the intersection of
language and computation--which is how I describe my positioning
within my interests.

I've always felt outside of traditional English departments, like I
fundamentally didn't belong, despite my primary interest being in
language. I felt more like an outsider so when I started doing
"digital humanities" work.

Traditional English departments - the study of English Language and
Literature -- the study of english letters -- a study of history,
culture, form. But the idea here is that language, and it's ltierary
instances, are the primary object. And to that object, we've appended
multiple assumptions, attributes, like prestige determines quality,
for example. The imbrication of language and nation. Prestige
determines inclusion. This is not new. It's been already argued in
cultural critiques, in the canon wars, I'm not saying anything new. We
know that the discipline (and what of this word, discipline, as a way
of cordoning knowledge?) of English--what we call English--is
structural to reinforce hegemonic ideas about language, prestige--the
imbrications of language and nation--the prioritization of certain
types of writing, from writers in a dominant cultural position. It
emerges in the ways that we organize our study. I'm sure many of you
are already thinking and talking about this. Periodization. The
implication that intellectual interest is organized by the same
motivations / logics as national history, and reinforces the
objectivity of that organization. Remember applying here, how you
chose your specialization from a dropdown?

So what I have been saying isn't new: but what I'm going to say is to
make a proposal for one way of rethinking the work we do in English,
the way that we organize and conceptualize that work.

I am going to start with a question, posed by Eve Sedgwick, about
criticism, and what it /does/.

#+begin_quote
"Moving from the rather fixed question Is a particular piece of
knowlege true, and how can we know? to the further questions: what
does knowledge /do/--the pursuit of it, the having and exposing of
it" (124, /Touching Feeling/)
#+end_quote

What is the effect of knowledge?

The "paranoid trust in exposure seemingly depends... on an infinite
reservoir of naivete" (141). We assume exposure will "surprise,
disturb, nevermind motivate" (141).

Sedgwick explains that "reparative motives" are dismissed because they
are "about pleasure ('merely aesthetic') and amelioriative ('merely
reformist')" (144).

"Mere" - because pleasure is not as motivating. Is not as
"intolerable" as exposure.

Sedgwick offers instead:
- "imaginative close reading" - "the devalued and near obsolescent
  critical skill" (/Touching Feeling/ 145).
- "local theories and nonce taxonomies" (/Touching Feeling/ 145).

A reparative position for reading is
- open to being surprised (whereas paranoia expects to be surprised)
- guided by hope: if we can imagine a different future, we can imagine
  a different past.

#+begin_quote
Hope, often a fracturing, even a traumatic thing to experience, is
among the energies by which the reparatively positioned reader tries
to organize the fragments and part-objects she encounters or
creates. Because the reader has room to realize that the future may be
different from the present, it is also possible for her to entertain
such profoundly painful, profoundly relieving, ethically crucial
possibilities that the past, in turn, could have happened differently
from the way it actually did. (/Touching Feeling/ 146). 
#+end_quote

"Whatever else we know, we know that there isn't time to bullshit"
(149). 

Reparative reading enables us to learn "the ways selves and
communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a
culture--even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to
sustain them" (/Touching Feeling/ 151).

*** april 15 
This notion of close reading. Is this what I want to talk about in my
book?

Reading over my old papers. I don't want to do this kind of work
anymore. I don't want to read piles and piles of criticism with a
larger purpose of making sure I have the authority to speak -- but
rather to read for learning -- how others handle texts, how other are
thinking through their readings -- but from a position of
inferiority. Because no matter what, how much you read and how well
you write, it's never going to be good enough. Now I read those papers
and I think -- this is much better than I thought it was back then. I
remember feeling that it was a big work, a big project. And I remember
the sense of accomplishment at the end, after I'd submitted the
papers. The joy of putting the ideas together throughout the process
too.

But underneath all of that, there was this sense, this dread, this
conviciton that my work wouldn't be good enough. Which is why perhaps
it's taken me a long time to finally reject the academic written
form. I've finally explicitly rejected it. I always knew it was
stifling. Even as I was convinced I'd never be good enough.

I never believed the praise I got from my teachers, never believed
it. Now I believe it.

But that's not what I want to write about. I want to write about close
reading. It's about what Sedgwick says, what does knowledge
/do/. Could this be a way of organizing a discipline? a study of
English? Not what is the truth, what is the content. But maybe. What
kind of action does this study, this criticism, this reading motivate?
What does this kind of reading, this kind of cirtique, actually do in
the physical world?

Maybe I could give an example. My take on this is quite literal. As I
work with digital tools that actually do things, perform computations
upon language. I do a lot of coding that makes transformations of
literary text, like in text analysis, for example, or in marking up
textual changes (like changes in a manuscript) so they can be
represented in digital formats.

My work uses the nuance and complexity of liteary language to test
out the constraints, the limitations, of digital tools. Right now, I'm
working on, perhaps unsurprisingly, large language models.

I'm interested in how the generative capacities of these models, what
some have refered to as "creativity" but what is really just
statistical prediction, can teach us about the assumptions embedded in
language, particularly discriminatory views.

I'm looking at a body of legislative text that limits the rights of
transgender people across the united states. I'm interested in how
these bills are conceptualizing gender. 

*** april 17
I am going to discuss mqy current work, and how it tries to enact what
Sedgwick describes: a kind of imaginative close reading, /which
extracts sustenance from cultural objects not meant to sustain us/.

I'm going to see what we can gain from a technological process (in
this case, having to do with AI) that has the effect of perpetuating
discriminatory and biased views. I'm going to see what we can gain
from studying these kind of constraining systems, which is more than
just an unveiling (as Sedgwick often describes it) of injustice or
oppression.

To start that discussion of movement, of how knowledge work might
/create movement/, move others to action, I'm going to study an
example from our current political moment, just one of the many
authoritarian trends sweeping this country, which is the anti-trans
movement. In particular, I am studying the anti-trans legislation
that's being debated and passed all over the country.

From this legislation, I'm interested in exploring how the rhetoric
reinforces one of the most galvanizing aspects of the movement, a
particular flavor of transphobia: which is the fear that gender
dysphoria can spread from one person to another like a
contagion. Anti-trans folks call this "Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria,"
or ROGD.

*** april 18
Anti-trans attitudes:

Rapid onset gender dysphoria: this idea that transness can spread from
one person to another, like a contagion. Cassius Adair describes this
kind of threat as a fear of seduction.

This threat is a not only a fear, but a motivating fear. A fear of
seduction. A fear of being moved to action, to transition.

I'm interested in using LLMs to study this fear of seduction. 
- LLMs are really good at generalizing, at making predictions.
  - what is machine learning? Logistic regression: They get enough
    examples of x and y, so they can map the relationship between x
    and y. There's a formula that maps it. Eventually, with enough
    examples, they can get any x and be able to map it pretty well to
    a y.
  - in this mapping, words, language, is given a numerical
    representation, what's technically called a word vector. This
    enables the computer to make mathematical calculations with the
    word, to make predictions.

In a model, words are an approximation. Language is an approximation.

I'm wondering how this approximation in language might allow us to
study more muted, subtle aspects of tone and meaning in language,
specifically of irony. Trans Studies has theorized irony as an
affective mode that distinguishes trans from queer: while queer wants
to rebel, push and cross boundaries, trans, in the words of Andrea
Long Chu, "just wants to pass" (check quote).

I'm interested in exploring how the fear/seduction of ROGD is embedded
in irony.

Here are some examples of irony from a book, which has since been
discredited (check status of this!) that helped to popularize the term
ROGD.

/examples of irony from 'irreversable damage'/

Taking this lens to read the results of the gender generator.

people can re-operationalize gendering and sexualization practices"

Marquis Bey: “Where queer theory advanced a sense of antinormativity
as the golden child of its theorization, as it were, trans studies
might (and I mean might) be said to advance a nonnormativity, the
distinction of which from anti-normativity is one in which the
anti-indexes a militant rejection or reactive opposition, whereas the
non-references, for me, a subversion, a decline to state that refuses
the very logics that structure the ability to say yes or no. Trans
studies offers me that, the tinkering and refusal that cares less
about opposing the hegemonic on its own terms and much more about
subverting the hegemonic by way of living life on another terrain."

Eliza Steinbock: “trans analytics have (historically, though not
universally) a different set of primary affects than queer
theory. Both typically take pain as a reference point, but then their
affective interest zags. Queer relishes the joy of subversion. Trans
trades in quotidian boredom. Queer has a celebratory tone. Trans
speaks in sober detail. Perhaps the style of trans studies has been
for the most part realist, but this should not be mistaken for base
materialism. Even speculative thinking requires enough detail to
launch into new realms.”

**** Chu, Andrea Long. “The Right to Change Sex.” Intelligencer, 11 Mar. 2024, https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trans-rights-biological-sex-gender-judith-butler.html.

“we have largely failed to form a coherent moral account of *why*
someone’s gender identity should justify the actual biological
interventions that make up gender-affirming care. If gender really
*is* an all-encompassing structure of social norms that produces the
illusion of sex, critics ask, why would the affirmation of someone’s
gender identity entail a change to their biology?”

“This is why the anti-trans movement is so desperate: It is afraid of
what sex might *become.”*

“I am not terribly bothered by saying that the division of sex
determines gender norms, so long as we remember that it never remotely
*finishes* determining them.”

“I am speaking here of a universal birthright: the freedom of
sex. This freedom consists of two principal rights: the right to
change one’s biological sex without appealing to gender and the right
to assume a gender that is not determined by one’s sexual biology.”

“By asserting the freedom of sex, we may stop relying on the
increasingly metaphysical concept of gender identity to justify
sex-changing care, as if such care were only permissible when one’s
biological sex does not match the serial number engraved on one’s
soul… In general, we must rid ourselves of the idea that any necessary
relationship exists between sex and gender; this prepares us to claim
that the freedom to bring sex and gender into whatever relation one
chooses is a basic human right.”

“They do not owe us an explanation. They are busy taking charge of
their own creation. They may not change the world, but they will
certainly change *themselves.”*


** draft
**** Thank you for having me here today.

Since the beginning of my time here in the English department, I used
to be afraid of this podium. When I saw people speaking up here, I
could feel my own heart beating inside my body and my face flush. Even
if nobody was speaking, or there was no event going on, sometimes just
looking at the podium would make me feel panicky. That's because I had
a terrible, almost debilitating fear of public speaking. This fear
began when I first started graduate school, and it stayed with me for
many years.

The cause of this fear is going to be the subject of this talk. It has
to do with what is called impostor syndrome. Impostor syndrome, which
many of you may also know through personal experience, is when a
person feels that they aren't enough--not smart, hardworking, skilled,
or otherwise--and that any success they have achieved is due to luck
or coincidence rather than effort or talent. A person with impostor
syndrome is afraid that their great secret--that they are not good
enough--will be discovered. 

I'm going to use this fear to think through the role of graduate work,
within English deparments specifically, in perpetuating certain
systems of knowledge. By unpacking the fear, I want to get at what I
think is the central structural issue that's holding English
departments back, from my perspective, from speaking to issues of our
current moment, in the contemporary world outside these windowless
walls. The stakes of graduate work have to do with how we engage with
the current world.

I decided to study English, perhaps like many of you, because I
enjoyed reading and talking about what I read. Despite that, I never
felt quite like I belonged in an English department.

Maybe that's because my work is fundamentally interdisciplinary, and
can be better categorized as "Digital Studies" or "Queer Studies,"
rather than English. (I'll get into this later in the talk, but
really, I'm only using literary language as a means or a kind of test
case and skill set for talking about what happens to information when
we engage with it in digital processes and formats.) The object of my
study is not literary language. It's technological systems, formats,
and processes. I use literary language as a tool for testing and
trying technology.

I'm going to talk a little bit about how we organize English
departments and how that organization creates and perpetuates systems
of knowledge and prestige. These systems of knowledge and prestige, I
argue, create boundaries around the discipline that keep it from
people who might want to change it, or who might want to do work
within that would change the world. In other words, these are systems
that facilitate impostor syndrome. Then I'm going to pose some ideas,
or provocations, for organizing our work in ways that might encourage
or embolden people to join and contribute their knowledge and life
experience. Finally, I'm going to give an example of how I interpret
these provocations into my own work, in the past and in the future. I
hope that the example of my own journey into scholarship, (I now
consider myself a scholar), will prompt others to think about ways for
integrating or aligning their work, especially if that work is not
"traditional" English scholarship, in ways that open English Studies.

**** english departments
First, I'll begin with English departments. Traditionally, the study
of the English, or English Language and Literature, 



What unites me with others in the English departments is methodology,
which is close reading. This is something that most of us relate
to--in our research and in our teaching. But close reading is not part
of the way that we organize English departments.
