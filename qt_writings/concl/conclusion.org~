*** sensual fullness of a lack
- Returning to the question about /Waves/: How does its structure
  relate to queerness? 
- A lack of fulfillment/total understanding draws on this idea that
  queerness strategically lacks a teleology.
    - Insert: /Confessions/ reading?
    - Munoz: queerness is not here. Queerness is a structuring mode of
      desiring. 
    - What does this gain us? A way of reading touch that is more
      concerned with exploring the potential of a touch rather than
      verifiable contact. The sensual fullness of a lack. 

TEXT:

 Clicking
(touching) her way through the narrative, the reader is repeatedly
reminded of her removal from the story, in her inability to grasp the
story. This work thus literalizes the connection between touch, its
frustration, and queer desire.

It is interesting that this medium makes the story accessible through
touch (the “click” on the hyperlinks) while not giving full visual
access to the individual narratives like a traditional print work
(which is a phenomenon exaggerated in the ticker tape).
