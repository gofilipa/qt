- past posts: 
    - worked out "untouchable" as raw data about queer subjectivity
      and experience that cannot be quantified. In order to engage (or
      “interface”) with this data, we need abstraction and
      formalization.
	- Looked for analogies of the "untouchable" in other fields
      (history and science) that eschew the impulse to verify,
      correct, or recover.This impulse for satisfaction is observed in
      “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading practices, which attempt to
      find "hidden meaning" in texts in a way that constrains inquiry.

this week, worked on the introduction, the intersection of digital and
queer.
