About a week ago I converted my chapter document into a word
doc. Until now, I've only been engaging with the draft on through the
text editor Emacs using Org Mode, an amazing format that allows you to
collapse paragraphs and outlines to make writing cleaner and more
navigable. As a result, however, I didn't have a sense of how long my
document was until I opened it in Word. Turns out I have 34 pages
single spaced. And I still need to draft what I think will take up
about one third of the chapter. Clearly, some revision and
reorganization is necessary.

So I took the week to go through the entire doc, writing concise
notes and outlines of my work so far, and flagging things that still
need to be done. Below is an image of the first 2/3 or so of the
chapter draft, showing the outline and flags for specific sections:

After taking this time to step back and see the big picture, I feel a
lot better about the work that I've already achieved, though almost
all of the paragraphs need some work in revising and refining. There's
still a long way to go, but there's also an arc here, a form of my
argument that takes shape despite the gaps.

For now, I'm going to set some goals:
- first, the next week (July 27) I will draft the final third of the
chapter. This will be hard work.
- the next two weeks, (august 3 & 10) will be spent on cleaning up the
first three sections, "intro to touch" and "queerness as untouchable,"
and "solutions." This is to prepare for sharing those pages with my
Undercommons writing group in mid-August.
- then, starting August 17 until September, I'll revise the rest of
the chapter, fulfilling any lingering TODOs
- following this schedule, by the end of August I will hopefully have
something, even if not perfect, to send to Matt.

As I revise, I find myself more and more myred in the various
definitions of queerness. It will be important to keep the following
in mind:
- Being queer is, at its core, a desire for connection---with oneself
or with others---that is continually thwarted by the oppression,
categories, and heteronormativity of dominant culture. Queerness which
we can only engage within formalized or opaque structures---the formal
experiments of queer writers.
- The "untouchable" denotes a state of *suspended knowledge* (about queer
subjectivity and experience) that allows me to then turn to *feeling
and affect* as epistemological methods.
