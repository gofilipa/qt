title: TEI and Queer Form
categories: [TEI, queer form, queer formalism, deformance, revising]
---

The work on chapter two has been taking longer than I thought-
there were three weeks of heavy revision in October/November, where I
made the following changes at the request of my peer reviewers. Then
a round of copyediting, which is done, and the final round of
proofreading, to be completed next week, after which the thing will
finally go to press. The major revisions included: 

- Clarified and foregrounded the central arguments w/r/t/ “queer
  encoding” and “queer form”
- Expanded sections on TEI, particularly discussion on my
  customization and the limitations of the tool
- Expanded engagement with Queer DH and Queer Historiography
  scholarship
- Cut down the overly descriptive sections on the history of the
  Manuscript
- Standardized the writing style and in-text citations (to Harvard
  style)
- Included links to online images of the manuscript, rather than
  images I took with my phone, as the Morgan did not let me use my
  images for free.
  
As I was doing this work, I was also preparing fellowship and grant
applicaitons. I applied for the ACLA, Ford, and Graduate Center
Dissertation Fellowships. I also applied for two research grants (was
awarded one of them!) and to a postdoctoral position at the New
School. Which is to say, I've also been spending a lot of time
theorizing my project across cover letters, proposals, abstracts, and
research, personal, and teaching statements.

One thing that I've been carefully theorizing is the importance of
*form* as a connection between the queer and digital---specifically
looking at how queerness takes certain forms in literary narrative and
voice, on the one hand, and how textual data takes certain forms when
it is digitized and/or computed. To explore queer form, I've been
marshalling Kadji Amin, Amber Musser, and Roy Perez's definition of
the term. They discuss queer form as a strategy for avoiding
compulsory visibility:

>For our purposes, queer form means challenging the primacy of the
>visual, which has too often been a site for pernicious power
>relations [...]. At their base, such operations of surveillance and
>classification rely on the concept of immutable difference, on sharp
>boundaries, and on the possibility of exhaustively knowing the other
>[...]. We see queer form as an aesthetics that moves persistently
>around the visual, thereby avoiding this flattening. To the extent
>that form operates behind the scenes as ideological impulse and
>materiality, queer formal practices can resist the dictates of
>transparency normally required of non-normative subjects by
>illuminating the unseen. In this way it not only troubles the
>epistemic assurances of the visual regime, but it also asks how
>shifting away from static visuality can circumnavigate questions of
>objectification. A move toward the diffusely sensual, and away from
>the linearity of visual gazing, articulates difference in terms that
>are not about dominance or norms, but that underscore the importance
>of thinking with other modes of knowing, theorizing, and
>experiencing. Queer form is about other ways of understanding
>relationships to power and relationships to being. 232-3

My work strives to show how Queer Form as an "aesthetics" can
productively mirror, and offer openings to study, digital forms. I've
been plumbing this connection between "queer formalism" and
"deformance" --- "queer formalism" is a term from Tyler Bradway's
*PMLA* article, "Queer Narrative Theory and the Relationality of
Form"; and "deformance" I take from Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuel's
foundational essay, "Deformance and Interpretation."
