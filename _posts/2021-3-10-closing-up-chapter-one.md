title: Closing Up Chapter One
categories: [text analysis, queer distant reading]

Even though I still need to finalize the conclusion (and add a final
example of text analysis), I'm deeming the first draft of my first
chapter complete. It's been nearly a year, and the thing has taken so
many shapes, texts, interventions in the meantime. Although there's
still a little more work to do, fleshing out some text analysis with
Python, the thing is being set aside. It doesn't feel totally done --
in fact I feel slightly guilty for setting it aside -- but I know that
any attempt to finalize it right now will just have to be revised once
I progress through other chapters and my intervention develops.

Below is an abstract for the project, which I recently submitted to
the [ACH conference][https://ach2021.ach.org/]:

**Queer Distant Reading: Quantifying Gender in Woolf’s “Orlando”**

This project explores how Queer Studies and quantitative text analysis
might work together to analyze queer identity in 20th and 21st century
literature. In recent years, practitioners of distant reading have
been grappling with the problem of quantifying gender and sexuality,
among other aspects of minority identity. My project intervenes in
this debate by exploring one of the stickier aspects of distant
reading--reproducibility. I trace a genealogy of reproducibility from
distant reading’s inception in Franco Moretti’s call for a
“falsifiable criticism” to more recent experiments in which
researchers “reproduce” their assumptions about social categories in
the results of their analysis. However, rather than condemn the
reproducible, this project unpacks its radical potential by reworking
it to engage with Judith Butler’s concept of performativity. Bringing
Butler’s foundational ideas about “performative citation” from Queer
Theory to distant reading, I propose a methodology that achieves
displacement through repetition, subversion through iteration, and
resistance from within the flattening processes of
quantification. This method illustrates how the iterative practice of
analyzing text computationally can surface new textual structures and
resignify elements of that text. I demonstrate this critical method
with an analysis of Virginia Woolf's text, Orlando: A Biography (1928)
to explore how the terms "man" and "woman" can be re-signified to
multiply our already complex understanding of gender in that
text. This method harnesses the reductions of reproducibility within
text analytical methods in order to advance the study of queer
identity in Queer Studies.
