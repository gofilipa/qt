It's been difficult to stay focused during the pandemic. Only the past
week have I been able to return to my dissertation work, and just to
go over my reading notes taken in the weeks prior to march 16, when I
left New York. I was working through a mountain of reading and
research in response to a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/Caladoscope/status/1232711183288934400) I
sent out about a month ago asking for examples of
non-white-cis-male-het distant reading.

So after this time of research and note-taking, I feel ready to start
writing again, and I'm starting to constellate some of the central
findings in the work of great feminist scholarship on distant
reading. 

In my last post, I zeroed in on what I see as the crux of my chapter's
argument, where I think much of this research will be deployed. The
chapter starts off with this conundrum---pointing out the necessity of
touch, and then the reality of queer experience and "raw data" which
are untouchable, sharing in the status of being constructed in some
way. The answer to handling this construction is to celebrate the
necessity of critical detachment and how it opens up the way we
interface with constructions. By abstracting data we can move with
them and find new modes of moving with with them. The method lies in
bodies "touching" through their own abstraction.  

In my reading, I found that much of the writers were inspired by
Drucker, or build off Drucker's ideas as foundational to their
thinking. There is this general agreement that all data is capta. They
build off this notion into different directions, and below are the two
strands I find most useful for my project:

- the first is the strand of *criticism as performance*. Critics like
  Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement stress the performativity of the
  critical process; Bode emphasizing more the materiality of the
  critical apparatus, and Clement emphasizing the process of
  discovery. Both are heavily indebted to ideas from textual
  criticism, particularly of Jerome McGann. They are formalists. 
  
- the second strand is of *dynamicity* or *vantages*. These critics
  look at how computation affords possibilities for social critique by
  refusing "totalizing" narratives and approaching modeling as
  something partial yet dynamic. Lauren Klein looks for methods that
  engage multiple dimensions of the invisible in data; Laura Mandell
  at how we might "animate numerical processes" rather than establish
  them; and Susan Brown's category work exhorts critics to work with
  provisionality, rather than aim for permanence. I could also add
  Julia Flanders and Pamela Caughie to this list. 
  
Does it make sense for me to separate these two strands? They are both
based on approaching criticism as a vital exercise, but they seem to
differ on the emphasis of social vs formal critique. Is that a
separation I want to uphold here? 

What I'm really interested is in how these critics address the body in
their processes. How can I incorporate a concern for affect here?
