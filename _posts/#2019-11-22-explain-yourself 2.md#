Last week I had a dissertation workshop where I presented a rough
draft of my chapter on Social Annotation. I was feeling pretty
vulnerable about it, not only is the draft in its infancy, but it also
combines a few disciplines that aren't typical for projects in English
studies.

To give some background---I'm developing a digital annotation tool
that has a multi-color highlighter for teaching purposes. I'm hoping
that the colors will help students to engage their immediate and
embodied responses to reading, which happen prior to their
articulation in language. Basically, I'm hoping that using colors will
allow readers to mark their reactions to reading by assigning certain
reactions to specific colors. The point, for me, is to explore
alternative kinds of annotation, particularly annotation that short
circuits verbalized forms of response. My paper on this project (which
will be fully drafted once I use the tool in the classroom)
interweaves my narrative of the tool's technical development with
discourses on educational technology and neuroscience. Wit, I'm
trying to address the ways that current annotation tools track or
quantify student data, and how looking at reading from a
neuroscientific lense, particularly from the perspective of embodied
cognition, opens up the way we understand students' engagement with
text. To better display this engagement, I created the highlighter
with really low color opacities that facilitates layering. I imagine
that, in a social reading situation, different readers will highlight
with different colors over the same piece of text. My idea is that the
color-highlighter's layering capability will create a kind of
"heatmap" of the text, which manifests in new color combinations. This
palimpsest of readings will (I hope) show


my professor saying that i need to explain the utility of this
tool. life go fuck yourself sir.
