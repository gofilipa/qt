Over the past two weeks, I continue to interweave discussions on queer
theory and dh methods, focusing on what they share---the sensitivity
to textual objects, mediated by the critic's self-consciousness of her
distance from the object. 

It has been difficult to keep a structure, and I continue to revise my
outlines as I add more theorists. So far, I've come up with this
master sketch for the chapter:

- touch as a reading method: making & opening connections
  - anzaldua and sedgwick on touch as connective and multiplying
- queerness as untouchable: something we cannot fully grasp
  - love and cvetkovitch on queer negativity
- data as unknowable: something we cannot fully grasp
  - drucker and underwood on studying cooked data
- the illusion of critical detachment, we need bodies
  - felski's affective method
  - sedgwick on reparative reading
- abstraction as necessary in order to bring things into relation
  - sedgwick on generative shame
  - klein on figuring what is absent
- the parallels between DH and Queer theorists, different reading
styles; refocus on touch
  - feminist distant reading
  - mcgann, ramsay on deformance, piper on close & distant. 
  - example of queer theorist who is guided by
    touching/feeling... affect theories? Munoz, Anzaldua, Ahmed... 
- my reading of /voyant-tools/ & /waves/

The progression builds off the notion of touch, then immediately
brings in that which is untouchable---queerness and data, and starts
to plot how we might move from there, into a criticism that celebrates
detachment by turning to the body and abstraction. Bodies engaging
with the subject matter through abstraction. By abstracting data, we
can move within them and interface with them. Something along those
lines. 

The writing process is slow, as I'm trying to coordinate my readings
of the critics and bring them into a narrative. There are moments,
however, when I break free from my critics, to articulate without
substantiation the focus on touch and the necessity of critical
distance. In those moments the writing is loose and easy.

At this point, I'm trying very deliberately to base my method on work
done by women and especially queer women of color. When it comes to
digital humanities, this has been tough, because as Sara Ahmed says,
whiteness and maleness automatically reproduce themselves. We
reproduce them without intention, and it takes a willful effort to
center other voices.

In that vein, I tweeted out a call for "non-cishet-white-male distant
reading." The responses I got were overwhelming, with people citing
their own work and others. So I'm inundated with some exciting reading
for the next couple of weeks.
