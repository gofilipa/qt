In my last post, I started to organize my thoughts on feminist distant
reading. My focus was to work out how we might open up the way we
interface with queerness as "untouchable," as the raw data that cannot
be quantified. The solution is to abstract and formalize so we can
move or "interface" with it.

The past few weeks I have dived into the issue of the
"untouchable"---what does it mean for the way we do critique?
Primarily, I've been looking for ways that other fields have eschewed
the impulse to verify, correct, or recover. In what follows, I outline
the main argument from the first third of my chapter, where I lay out
the state of queerness as "untouchable" by finding analogies in the
fields of science and history. 

First, queerness is defined as a desire for touch (the digital), a
desire that cannot be satisfied, redeemed, or recovered. This impulse
for satisfaction is observed in "paranoid" or "suspicious" reading
practices, which seek to answer or discover the "hidden" meaning in

that constrains inquiry. This is because paranoia only delivers the
results that are /imaginable/ within current the knowledge
structures. 

We see the harm of paranoia, for example, in methods of science and
histor. We encounter excellent critiques of these methods particularly
in recovery projects, such as slave history or the black
atlantic. Here, the goal of recovery creates a
