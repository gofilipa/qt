title: Feedback on Chapter One Intro
categories: [dissertation workshop, feedback, revision]
--- 

Last week I shared the intro to my first chapter with my dissertation
workshop. Below is the feedback I received, indicating points for
revision. 

First, positives: people are really compelled by my topic and close
readings. They appreciate the ways I am engaging DH and Queer Theory
around the trope of "touch."

Now, for the criticism: 

The three heavy footnotes in the beginning are tripping people up, a
bit overwhelming. Work on spreading this out. In doing so, luxuriate
in the idea of how digital etymology relates to the idea of touch.

clarify specific terms/concepts: 
- Who is **Matt Kirschenbaum**? Characterize him a little bit for
  outsiders. Situate myself in relation to him. Also consider taking
  out or reducing the footnote on materiality, because it's tripping
  people up. 
- Explain why I am choosing this word **formalization** to describe a
  construct. What does this term do that "construct" cannot do?
  Another sentence on what I mean here.
- What Queer theory am I using, at **reconsolidation**. The
  abstraction of the queer subject. (related to the issue of
  positioning myself w/ regard to queer theory: The ways that queer
  subjectivity is constructed differently in early poststructrualism,
  as opposed to affect theory. Affect theory tries to bring the body
  back, thinking to Sara Ahmed vs Foucault). In addition to defining
  my position/sources, also consider how "queer" can be reclaimed by
  those it is meant to oppress (Butler, 'Critically Queer'). 
- **the sensual fullness of a lack**: see butler on beauvoir and
  irigaray, two women together as a double lack, in gender
  trouble. /When our two lips touch/, Irigaray
- see how **haptic** is being deployed in other disciplines. 
- what do I mean by **touch as abstraction** on page 3? The physical
  experience of touch may be an abstraction, or abstracted, but it is
  not experienced as such. Jacob: "Touch often registers as painful
  immediacy". See Ann Cvetkovitch's writing on Stone Butch Blues. 
- on page 3, I'm making sweeping claims about the **Queer
  Subject**. Is there a single queer subject, a queer subjectivity? Do
  the narrators demonstrate this? If so, what is that kind of queer?

More broadly: 
- how does the digital relate to the **body**? how does it change the
  body? how does queerness do this? --> Butler's points about how a
  body doesn't come into being until contact in /Bodies that Matter/.
- what am I doing with **touch more broadly**? why is this chapter
  about touch?
- emphasize that I'm doing this **new thing**, this new field. DH can
  help us theorize the queer; and queer can help us understand the
  Digital.
- clarify the relationship between **removal, touch, and grasp**. How
  are these distinct?

In close readings, **the various registers of touch** are at odds.  
- I start the chapter by saying that queer and the digital are related
  through touch, then I assert that it is a troubled relationship to
  touch. Make it clear at the start that I'm thinking about touch as a
  complicated activity/phenomenon, not touch as always making
  contact. 
- How the implications of touch are slightly different or opposite to
  each other across the close readings. One is frustrated touch and
  one touch opens up. Establish the connection between the two.
- There's a tension between literal touch (touching the text) and
  figurative touch (touch as a trope, touch via sight). Emphasize and
  distinguish the difference between touch as a figure within the text
  and as a means of engaging without the text. Additionally, on the
  literal side, how is this touch (clicking through) different from
  turning the page?
- revise the close reading of /waves/ to include analysis of the beam
  routine. How is touch operating? there is no touch in this scene.
- the paradox of touch: the untouchable is good --- it is a paradox. 
   - the paradox of touch: touching w/o touching

Revise close-reading of /Waves/
- people found it confusing regarding "touch" and doesn't cohere as
  nicely as /Confessions/ with my chapter argument.
- emphasize dynamics of the beam routine, the not touching in that
  episode paralleling the not touching of /Confessions/.
- explain clearly the removal between reader and text not only in the
  level of narrative form but also in the materiality of the substance
  of the story, the codes and computation.

More readings:
- on Munoz --> also think about Raymond Williams, and structures of
  feelings which will help you elaborate on emergence.
- will narratology help me clarify some of the terms on page 6, on the
  close readings of /Waves/? Mieke Bal perhaps.
