Submitted my prospectus to the English office today. It's been a long
process---three months, three drafts, two reviews in Dissertation
Workshop.

I changed the introduction, going more directly into Queer DH. I also
narrowed down the focus of the main paragraphs after the intro:
reading method, Life Writing, Cyborgs, and added a paragraph on
"Queer," used in three ways:

* Queer Methods (reading practices, relationality---touching but not
  touching)- A reading method, searching for moments of misfitting.
* Queer Materiality (queer subjects, digital media)- At the level of
the body and the computer, looking at the materiality of "mind" and
"computation". Close reading the man and the machine. A rubric for
engagement, human-machine interactions, the cyborg.
* Queer Texts (life writing: memoir & journals, manuscripts)- Formal
experiments of literature that engage experience and cognition as
embodied processes, modes of perception that are
enworlded. Figurations of the digital.

I also added a paragraph, "Toward Disability," which elaborates the
aesthetic encounter between reader and object, the logical conclusion
of a queer relationality, my reading method. Here, I concretize my
interest in "electronic editing schemas that mark elusive
subjectivities, digital annotation tools that visualize affective
responses to reading, and archival digitization efforts that animate
the past." I also added a paragraph introducting the chapter
descriptions and tying together the threads around this central
question: "How do our current digital tools facilitate queer
encounters with literature?"

In a meeting last week, M-- asked me some questions that helped me to
whittle down my motives:

How would I summarize my project in one sentence? 
- About looking at ways that technology disrupts our expectations. How
  it prompts the incommensurable. 

What am I most interested in? 
- The materiality of media, and of human bodies.
