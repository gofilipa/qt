About a week ago I converted my chapter document into a word
doc. Until now, I've only been engaging with the draft on through the
text editor Emacs using Org Mode, an amazing format that allows you to
collapse paragraphs and outlines to make writing cleaner and more
navigable. As a result, however, I didn't have a sense of how long my
document was until I opened it in Word. Turns out I have 34 pages
single spaced. And I still need to draft what I think will take up
about one third of the chapter. Clearly, some reorganization and
revision is necessary.

So I took the week to go through the entire doc, writing concise
notes and outlines of my work so far, and flagging things that still
need to be done. 




(which I'm writing in
org mode using Emacs)
- The "untouchable" denotes a state of *suspended knowledge* (about queer
subjectivity and experience) that allows me to then turn to *feeling
and affect* as epistemological methods.
- Being queer is, at its core, a desire for connection---with oneself
or with others---that is continually thwarted by the oppression,
categories, and heteronormativity of dominant culture. Queerness which
we can only engage within formalized or opaque structures---the formal
experiments of queer writers.
