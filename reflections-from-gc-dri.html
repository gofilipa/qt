</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The past few days we have been running our annual <a href="https://gcdri.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Digital Research
Institute</a> at the Graduate Center
Digital Initiatives. I've taught three sessions of python, and
supported sessions on Text Analysis, as well as helping out in Command
Line, Git/Github, and attended Mapping.</p>
<p>What I've found, or realized once again, is how much my approach
toward data and method informs my interest in DH. </p>
<p>As I watched the Text Analysis workshop unfold, the most striking
realization was the preconceptions and biases we bring into our
inferences. We might make certain assumptions about analysis. For
example, in Natural Language Toolkit's (NLTK) <code>similar()</code> method, we
measure what words are similar to any other word. In the analysis
below, we see what words are associated to "love" across two different
texts, <em>Moby Dick</em> (text1) and <em>Sense And Sensibility</em> (text2).</p>
<p><img alt="Finding words that are similar to &quot;love&quot; in *Moby Dick* and *Sense
and Sensibility*" src="../images/love-similar.jpg"></p>
<p>For Melville, love is associated with the strong natural forces,
having to do with nature ("sea," "whale," "fear") and men, male bodies
("head," "hand," "him," "me"). In Austen, the word love has
associations with domestic life, family and specific people ("sister,"
"mother," "elinor," "marianne"). Both Melville and Austen share "head"
and "him," though Austen also has "heart" (while Melvill has "hand")
and "her." In Austen, affect is associated with "affection," while
Melville associates it with "fear."</p>
<p>I wonder how our analysis might change when we know the text is
written by a woman. What kinds of conclusions are we tempted to draw?
Presumably, that love for Austen is associated with familial
affection, and for Melville, with awe of nature and man, and that
these differences indicate gender differences. To be overly reductive:
women find love in the home, and men out in the world.</p>
<p>But this desire to draw conclusions isn't the right approach, or at
least it's not the most interesting to me. I am not doing text
analysis to answer a question. I am doing it to arrive at the
question, which is a way to keep the literary conversation going (see
Stephen Ramsay, <em>Algorithmic Criticism</em>). During the session, Rafa
said something that reinforced this idea, that "text analysis is just
playing with lists."  That idea of play is the space I want to stay
in.</p>
<p>In the spirit of play, I'm thinking a lot about how we can try to
queer or mess around with some of the reductions of "cleaning text."
Obviously, the more and more you clean your data, that you simplify
and regularize strings, the easier it is to see the relationships
between them (Moretti: "where <em>distance</em> is a condition of
<em>knowledge</em>"). Lemmatizing words, stemming them, removing stopwords
and punctuation, are ways of reducing the complexity of data in order
to make comparisons between them and draw conclusions. </p>
<p>So I'm proposing that we take a closer look at some of the data that
is often ignored in text analysis, which are "stopwords." Stopwords
are text that are commonly used and thought to be semantically void,
such as articles and prepositions. I compiled a list of stopwords from
one of my favorite texts,
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200331.txt"><em>Orlando: A Biography</em></a> by Virginia
Woolf:</p>
<p><code>['for', 'there', 'be', 'no', 'of', 'his', 'the', 'of', 'the',
'did', 'to', 'it', 'was', 'in', 'the', 'of', 'at', 'the', 'of', 'a',
'which', 'from', 'the', 'was', 'the', 'of', 'an', 'and', 'more', 'or',
'the', 'of', 'for', 'the', 'and', 'a', 'or', 'of', 'the', 'on', 'a',
'or', 'his', 'had', 'it', 'from', 'the', 'of', 'a', 'who', 'had',
'up', 'under', 'the', 'in', 'the', 'of', 'and', 'now', 'it', 'in',
'the', 'which', 'through', 'the', 'of', 'the', 'of', 'the', 'who',
'had', 'him', 'had', 'in', 'of', 'and', 'and', 'by', 'and', 'they',
'had', 'of', 'off', 'and', 'them', 'to', 'from', 'the', 'too', 'he',
'he', 'was', 'only', 'and', 'too', 'to', 'with', 'them', 'in', 'or']</code> </p>
<p>Anyone who is familiar with <em>Orlando</em> will notice the cadence of the
first few sentences in these lines. I'm interested in how these words,
often overlooked, can give us some insight into the movement of the
text. Can prepositions help to suggest the energy or tone of a passage?
How might they be compared to what William James describes in "Stream
of Thought" as the the "moments of flight" between "images" or "resting places"
(typically conveyed by nouns and adjectives)? I don't know if this
line of thinking will lead anywhere, but it seems like an interesting
project. </p>
