</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Submitted my prospectus to the English office today. It's been a long
process---three months, three drafts, two reviews in Dissertation
Workshop.</p>
<p>I changed the introduction, going more directly into Queer DH. I also
narrowed down the focus of the main paragraphs after the intro:
reading method, Life Writing, Cyborgs, and added a paragraph on
"Queer," used in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queer Methods (reading practices, relationality---touching but not
  touching)- A reading method, searching for moments of misfitting.</li>
<li>Queer Materiality (queer subjects, digital media)- At the level of
the body and the computer, looking at the materiality of "mind" and
"computation". Close reading the man and the machine. A rubric for
engagement, human-machine interactions, the cyborg.</li>
<li>Queer Texts (life writing: memoir &amp; journals, manuscripts)- Formal
experiments of literature that engage experience and cognition as
embodied processes, modes of perception that are
enworlded. Figurations of the digital.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also added a paragraph, "Toward Disability," which elaborates the
aesthetic encounter between reader and object, the logical conclusion
of a queer relationality, my reading method. Here, I concretize my
interest in "electronic editing schemas that mark elusive
subjectivities, digital annotation tools that visualize affective
responses to reading, and archival digitization efforts that animate
the past." I also added a paragraph introducting the chapter
descriptions and tying together the threads around this central
question: "How do our current digital tools facilitate queer
encounters with literature?"</p>
<p>In a meeting last week, M-- asked me some questions that helped me to
whittle down my motives:</p>
<p>How would I summarize my project in one sentence? 
- About looking at ways that technology disrupts our expectations. How
  it prompts the incommensurable. </p>
<p>What am I most interested in? 
- The materiality of media, and of human bodies. </p>
