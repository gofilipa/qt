Title: Sketching the Book

So I have been thinking more and more about my dissertation, and what
to do with it. At first, I really resisted the idea of publishing
it. That genre of academic writing, which I mimed as a learning
exercise, felts inauthentic to me in the end. When I look at those
pages I see an attempt to fit a type of mold that doesn't reflect my
energy or my intention as a writer.

Something more authentic would be terse and mobile, moving from one
idea to the next with a clear goal structuring the progress. It would
not be typical, longform academic writing, but it would be just as
deeply researched. Notes and perhaps a glossary would be encoded in an
interesting way, maybe in the margins, with more dense theoretical
information in the back. I imagine something between a tutorial and a
manifesto, where each chapter takes up one computational concept, like
text analysis or text encoding, and guides the reader through a queer
inflected methodology for using that tool.

Here's an outline of the chapters:

- text analysis

- data formats 

- interface effects

- artificial intelligence

In analyzing the tools, the chapters would in turn explore concepts
theorized by Queer Studies, Black Feminist Studies, and Trans Studies,
like Gender Performativity, Dis-identifcation, Surface Aesthetics, and
Transphobia. I would want to find perhaps a tighter way of tying these
concepts together, because they do go in all directions. 

The main argument of the book is that computational structures create
power structures that reduce the complexity of real world
subjects. But we can resist that reduction by re-deploying its own
logic against it. Taking up the same process but with a slight
difference. This is an old argument, of course.
