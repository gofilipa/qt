My interests:
- exploring pre-verbal responses to reading in digital annotation tool
- critiquing edtech that tracks and quantifies student performance
- text analysis questions that resist conclusions, finding
  answers. Text analysis as a part of a speculative process, play.
- disability is positioned early on as the logical conclusion of my
  research into queer methodology. Of finding alternative methods of
  human-computer interaction. Looking at computers and humans in their
  physical, sensual dimensions opens up the possibilities for
  interaction.
- critical methods where the critic is aware of their distance from
  the object of study, and at times turns that distance into a
  heuristic. This begins with an interest in different reading
  methods, suspicious vs surface reading, for example. My being drawn  of the flesh, without feeling like I'm instrumentalizing it?

In a meeting in 2019, M asked me some quesitons to help me whittle
down my motives.

```
How would I summarize my project in one sentence? 
- About looking at ways that technology disrupts our expectations. How
  it prompts the incommensurable. 

What am I most interested in? 
- The materiality of media, and of human bodies.

Here's an articulation of my project from from 2020, which I think
still applies:

> The progression builds off the notion of touch, then immediately
> brings in that which is untouchable---queerness and data, and starts
> to plot how we might move from there, into a criticism that
> celebrates detachment by turning to the body and abstraction. Bodies
> engaging with the subject matter through abstraction. By abstracting
> data, we can move within them and interface with them. Something
> along those lines.
