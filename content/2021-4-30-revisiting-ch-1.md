Title: Revisting Chapter One

After letting the draft sit for a while, slightly traumatized by the
hectic process of wrapping it up over the winter, I was pleasantly
surprised by my perspective on it now. The argument that I found
discouragingly convoluted still reads as a bit messy but also
intriguing, particularly in the way it interweaveas deformance and
performativity. 

At this point, I really should be talking to my advisor about it. Even
if the prose isn't ready to share, the ideas are workable. Before
that, though, I'm going to give myself a week to revise some things
that stand out to me, in this order:

- add more up front on the technology of Distant Reading, how it
  works, a kind of media archaeology of the tech.
- flesh out the final analysis of Woolf's text (which depends on the
  specifics of Disant Reading tech).
- find a way to structurally integrate the close reading of Woolf's
  text. Interweave with the intro? Maybe starting with a meditation on
  gender?

In other news, my abstract on this chapter was accepted by the ACH
conference. One other abstract (on my second chapter, which I am now
in the process of researching) was accepted at MLA, as well as a book
article on the same chapter.
