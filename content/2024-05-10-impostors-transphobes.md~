Last Friday I gave a keynote at the English department at the Graduate
Center, CUNY, for their annual English Student Association (ESA)
conference, which was on the theme of graduate student work and its
many manifestations. I talked about my approach toward the
dissertation and my work since then, on studying the anti-trans
legislation. I organized my thoughts around the theme of "fear." Which
allowed me to tie together the fear and insecurities that come with
doing "non-traditional" work in English, reading practices that focus
on negative affects like fear, and my current work which analyzes
transphobia. The [talk is accessible

Giving that talk felt like a kind of culmination for me. I knew I
wanted to talk about my own fears throughout graduate school, of
impostor syndrome, which for me manifested most strongly as a fear of
public speaking. So I used that as a launch point. Then I went into
reading practices, using Sedgwick to frame a discussion on paranoid vs
reparative reading practices; and most usefully, for me, how
reparative reading takes what is traditionally seen to be repressive
and turns it into a source of sustenance, of generation. From there I
moved, perhaps rather abruptly, into my interest in studying
transphobia with AI. Then, in probably what was the most
disorientating progression for my audience, I dove deeply into the
workings of text generation in machine learning tools. I talked about
word vectors and generalization and made the case that text generation
is much like 

But it's only the start of all the threads, 

My ideas in that paper, how I am bringing them together. Lots of
threads.
