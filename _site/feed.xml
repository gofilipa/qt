example of text analysis), I’m deeming the first draft of my first
chapter complete. It’s been nearly a year, and the thing has taken so
many shapes, texts, interventions in the meantime. Although there’s
still a little more work to do, fleshing out some text analysis with
Python, the thing is being set aside. It doesn’t feel totally done –
in fact I feel slightly guilty for setting it aside – but I know that
any attempt to finalize it right now will just have to be revised once
I progress through other chapters and my intervention develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an abstract for the project, which I recently submitted to
the [ACH conference][https://ach2021.ach.org/]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queer Distant Reading: Quantifying Gender in Woolf’s “Orlando”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project explores how Queer Studies and quantitative text analysis
might work together to analyze queer identity in 20th and 21st century
literature. In recent years, practitioners of distant reading have
been grappling with the problem of quantifying gender and sexuality,
among other aspects of minority identity. My project intervenes in
this debate by exploring one of the stickier aspects of distant
reading–reproducibility. I trace a genealogy of reproducibility from
distant reading’s inception in Franco Moretti’s call for a
“falsifiable criticism” to more recent experiments in which
researchers “reproduce” their assumptions about social categories in
the results of their analysis. However, rather than condemn the
reproducible, this project unpacks its radical potential by reworking
it to engage with Judith Butler’s concept of performativity. Bringing
Butler’s foundational ideas about “performative citation” from Queer
Theory to distant reading, I propose a methodology that achieves
displacement through repetition, subversion through iteration, and
resistance from within the flattening processes of
quantification. This method illustrates how the iterative practice of
analyzing text computationally can surface new textual structures and
resignify elements of that text. I demonstrate this critical method
with an analysis of Virginia Woolf’s text, Orlando: A Biography (1928)
to explore how the terms “man” and “woman” can be re-signified to
multiply our already complex understanding of gender in that
text. This method harnesses the reductions of reproducibility within
text analytical methods in order to advance the study of queer
identity in Queer Studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="text analysis" /><category term="queer distant reading" /><summary type="html">Even though I still need to finalize the conclusion (and add a final example of text analysis), I’m deeming the first draft of my first chapter complete.

form. I had a meeting with my dissertation workshop in late October
that revealed to me how I was writing around the argument I wanted to
make, which is about deconstructing (in NKM’s words) “the fantasy of
the falsifiable.” So I cut about half of what I had already written,
the sections on the digital, queerness, and touch, and moved that to
an introductory chapter. What remained was the section where I
critique “reproducible” criticism, and that was pretty much it. Around
this section, I’ve written another on textual scholarship and
deformance, and one on queer performance. I’m now working on the final
section of the chapter, where I synthesize aspects from deformance and
preformance to present a new approach for “queer” text analysis. After
that, I will write up a quick intro that begins be presenting a
critique of the falsifiable, which I position as forerunner to the
reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of the chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of performativity, and how that
method enhances the critical process. It begins by debunking the
fantasy of falsifiable criticism, presenting a critique of moretti’s
methodology and stylistic approach (eventually with accompanying text
analysis). It then goes into a critique of current distant reading
practices, discussing Ted Underwood, Nan Z. Da, to emphasize how these
practices can often reproduce the critic’s assumptions. This section
also discusses the work of Johanna Drucker and Richard Jean So,
emphasizing that their methods do a good job deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I’m interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by producing new structures, or formalizations of these
texts. Then, I go into a history of textual scholarship, focusing
particularly on the work of Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode, who offer a deformative and speculative understanding
of critical analysis that is useful for my proposal. Then, I dip into
Queer Theory, in particular Judith Butler’s concepts of performativity
and citation, which lend an understanding to the ways that critical
processes can subvert dominant structures through iteration, or
“performative citation.” This notion of displacement through
repetition is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the
iterative process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures
that re-signify certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with
my reading of Virginia Woolf’s /Orlando/, to show how our
understanding of “man” and “woman” in that text is re-signified
through this kind of text analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps, is to continue to explore /Orlando/ and Moretti in Python
(though not for too long) so I can write up this final section and the
introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

workshop. Below is the feedback I received, indicating points for
revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, positives: people are really compelled by my topic and close
readings. They appreciate the ways I am engaging DH and Queer Theory
around the trope of “touch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for the criticism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three heavy footnotes in the beginning are tripping people up, a
bit overwhelming. Work on spreading this out. In doing so, luxuriate
in the idea of how digital etymology relates to the idea of touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clarify specific terms/concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kirschenbaum&lt;/strong&gt;? Characterize him a little bit for
outsiders. Situate myself in relation to him. Also consider taking
out or reducing the footnote on materiality, because it’s tripping
people up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain why I am choosing this word &lt;strong&gt;formalization&lt;/strong&gt; to describe a
construct. What does this term do that “construct” cannot do?
Another sentence on what I mean here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What Queer theory am I using, at &lt;strong&gt;reconsolidation&lt;/strong&gt;. The
abstraction of the queer subject. (related to the issue of
positioning myself w/ regard to queer theory: The ways that queer
subjectivity is constructed differently in early poststructrualism,
as opposed to affect theory. Affect theory tries to bring the body
back, thinking to Sara Ahmed vs Foucault). In addition to defining
my position/sources, also consider how “queer” can be reclaimed by
those it is meant to oppress (Butler, ‘Critically Queer’).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the sensual fullness of a lack&lt;/strong&gt;: see butler on beauvoir and
irigaray, two women together as a double lack, in gender
trouble. /When our two lips touch/, Irigaray&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;see how &lt;strong&gt;haptic&lt;/strong&gt; is being deployed in other disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what do I mean by &lt;strong&gt;touch as abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; on page 3? The physical
experience of touch may be an abstraction, or abstracted, but it is
not experienced as such. Jacob: “Touch often registers as painful
immediacy”. See Ann Cvetkovitch’s writing on Stone Butch Blues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on page 3, I’m making sweeping claims about the &lt;strong&gt;Queer
Subject&lt;/strong&gt;. Is there a single queer subject, a queer subjectivity? Do
the narrators demonstrate this? If so, what is that kind of queer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how does the digital relate to the &lt;strong&gt;body&lt;/strong&gt;? how does it change the
body? how does queerness do this? –&amp;gt; Butler’s points about how a
body doesn’t come into being until contact in /Bodies that Matter/.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what am I doing with &lt;strong&gt;touch more broadly&lt;/strong&gt;? why is this chapter
about touch?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emphasize that I’m doing this &lt;strong&gt;new thing&lt;/strong&gt;, this new field. DH can
help us theorize the queer; and queer can help us understand the
Digital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarify the relationship between &lt;strong&gt;removal, touch, and grasp&lt;/strong&gt;. How
are these distinct?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In close readings, &lt;strong&gt;the various registers of touch&lt;/strong&gt; are at odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I start the chapter by saying that queer and the digital are related
through touch, then I assert that it is a troubled relationship to
touch. Make it clear at the start that I’m thinking about touch as a
complicated activity/phenomenon, not touch as always making
contact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the implications of touch are slightly different or opposite to
each other across the close readings. One is frustrated touch and
one touch opens up. Establish the connection between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a tension between literal touch (touching the text) and
figurative touch (touch as a trope, touch via sight). Emphasize and
distinguish the difference between touch as a figure within the text
and as a means of engaging without the text. Additionally, on the
literal side, how is this touch (clicking through) different from
turning the page?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;revise the close reading of /waves/ to include analysis of the beam
routine. How is touch operating? there is no touch in this scene.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the paradox of touch: the untouchable is good — it is a paradox.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the paradox of touch: touching w/o touching&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revise close-reading of /Waves/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people found it confusing regarding “touch” and doesn’t cohere as
nicely as /Confessions/ with my chapter argument.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emphasize dynamics of the beam routine, the not touching in that
episode paralleling the not touching of /Confessions/.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain clearly the removal between reader and text not only in the
level of narrative form but also in the materiality of the substance
of the story, the codes and computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More readings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on Munoz –&amp;gt; also think about Raymond Williams, and structures of
feelings which will help you elaborate on emergence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;will narratology help me clarify some of the terms on page 6, on the
close readings of /Waves/? Mieke Bal perhaps.&lt;/li&gt;

doc. Until now, I’ve only been engaging with the draft on through the
text editor Emacs using Org Mode, an amazing format that allows you to
collapse paragraphs and outlines to make writing cleaner and more
navigable. As a result, however, I didn’t have a sense of how long my
document was until I opened it in Word. Turns out I have 34 pages
single spaced. And I still need to draft what I think will take up
about one third of the chapter. Clearly, some revision and
reorganization is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took the week to go through the entire doc, writing concise
notes and outlines of my work so far, and flagging things that still
need to be done. Below is an image of the first 2/3 or so of the
chapter draft, showing the outline and flags for specific sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/org_outline.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of chapter outline in emacs org
mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking this time to step back and see the big picture, I feel a
lot better about the work that I’ve already achieved, though almost
all of the paragraphs need some work in revising and refining. There’s
still a long way to go, but there’s also an arc here, a form of my
argument that takes shape despite the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m going to set some goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first, the next week (July 27) I will draft the final third of the
chapter. This will be hard work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the next two weeks, (august 3 &amp;amp; 10) will be spent on cleaning up the
first three sections, “intro to touch” and “queerness as untouchable,”
and “solutions.” This is to prepare for sharing those pages with my
Undercommons writing group in mid-August.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then, starting August 17 until September, I’ll revise the rest of
the chapter, fulfilling any lingering TODOs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;following this schedule, by the end of August I will hopefully have
something, even if not perfect, to send to Matt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I revise, I find myself more and more myred in the various
definitions of queerness. It will be important to keep the following
in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being queer is, at its core, a desire for connection—with oneself
or with others—that is continually thwarted by the oppression,
categories, and heteronormativity of dominant culture. Queerness which
we can only engage within formalized or opaque structures—the formal
experiments of queer writers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “untouchable” denotes a state of &lt;em&gt;suspended knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (about queer
subjectivity and experience) that allows me to then turn to &lt;em&gt;feeling
and affect&lt;/em&gt; as epistemological methods.&lt;/li&gt;

and how it functions in relation to queerness. “Untouchable” denotes a
state of &lt;em&gt;suspended knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (about queer subjectivity and
experience) that allows me to then turn to &lt;em&gt;feeling and affect&lt;/em&gt; as
epistemological methods.
    - First, I worked out a definition of “untouchable” as the raw
      data about queer subjectivity and experience that cannot be
      quantified. (later in the chapter, I will explain that in order
      to engage (or “interface”) with this data, we need abstraction
      and formalization.
	- Then, I looked for analogies of the “untouchable” in other
      fields (history and science) that display the impulse to verify,
      correct, or recover. In literary studies, this impulse for
      satisfaction is observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading
      practices, which attempt to find “hidden meaning” in texts in a
      way that constrains inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past two weeks, I’ve been working on the introduction, because
it occurs to me that I need a solid definition of queerness before
moving on to describe how queerness is untouchable. So I defined the
core condition of queerness being &lt;strong&gt;“the desire for touching,” a
desire that is ultimately frustrated, deferred, or eluded&lt;/strong&gt; (analogous
to Jose Munoz’s concept of queer horizon, the state of being “not yet
here”). Being queer is, at its core, a desire for connection—with
oneself or with others—that is continually thwarted by the
oppression, categories, and heteronormativity of dominant culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “desire for touching,” without being able to fully touch, as the
definition of queerness, is also where the digital and queer
intersect. Digital media creates the illusion that we have access to
data, to information, but all we have access to is a &lt;em&gt;formalized&lt;/em&gt;
relationship to that data. We encounter the digital object through
mediation, through an interface, mice, GUIs, keyboards, etc. It is the
same with queernes, which we can only engage within formalized or
opaque structures—the formal experiments of queer writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to begin the chapter with this meditation on the
intersection of the digital and queerness. Right now, I’m doing so by
providing a few close readings, right at the start, which define
queerness as a thwarted desire for touching. In the example I’ve
chosen, by Jordy Rosenberg’s &lt;em&gt;Confessions of the Fox&lt;/em&gt;, I use an
evocative quote that characterizes sexual desire not on touch, but how
precluding touch activates other sensations that are more physical,
more intense, than touch. Then I jump to a hypertext novella, &lt;em&gt;These
Waves of Girls&lt;/em&gt; by Caitlin Fisher, and discuss how the narrative pull
of clicking through the text enacts a desire for closure or
understanding that is never fully satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me now that I need to go a little more into the &lt;em&gt;Waves&lt;/em&gt;
example, include a bit of media archaeology, the formal and forensic
(Matt Kirschenbaum) levels of materiality, and a bit about how
hypertext works, to fully round out this point. I’m drawing a parallel
between what Rosenberg is doing with refusing touch and what Fisher is
doing by frustrating touch. They are both searching for alternative
modes of connections, modes that active a fuller sensorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the introduction might be structured thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an opening statement on how touch relates to queerness and the
digital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a definition of queerness as deferred desire for touching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introducing two case studies that demonstrate how queerness engages
this idea of deffered touch in text and digital media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, which is only meant to pique interest and
 set ideas into motion, I will move on to exploring the “untouchable”
 state of queerness in depth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="rosenberg" /><category term="fisher" /><category term="munoz" /><summary type="html">My past two posts have been clarifying the concept of “untouchable” and how it functions in relation to queerness. “Untouchable” denotes a state of suspended knowledge (about queer subjectivity and experience) that allows me to then turn to feeling and affect as epistemological methods. - First, I worked out a definition of “untouchable” as the raw data about queer subjectivity and experience that cannot be quantified.

reading. My focus was to work out how we might open up the way we
interface with queerness as “untouchable,” as the raw data that cannot
be quantified. The solution is to abstract and formalize so we can
move or “interface” with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I have dived into the issue of the
“untouchable”—what does it mean for the way we do critique?
Primarily, I’ve been looking for ways that other fields have eschewed
the impulse to verify, correct, or recover. In what follows, I outline
the main argument from the first third of my chapter, where I lay out
the state of queerness as “untouchable” by finding analogies in the
fields of science and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, queerness is defined as a desire for touch (the digital), a
desire that cannot be satisfied, redeemed, or recovered. This impulse
for satisfaction is observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading
practices, which seek to answer or discover the “hidden” meaning in
text. These practices attempt to answer questions, but do so in a way
that constrains inquiry. This is because paranoia only delivers the
results that are /imaginable/ within current the knowledge
structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the harm of paranoia, for example, in methods of science and
histor. We encounter excellent critiques of these methods particularly
in recovery projects, such as slave history or the black
atlantic. Here, the goal of recovery creates a system of inquiry that
predetermines the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is related to queerness, which is untouchable. It is a feeling of
embodied disembodiment, estrangement, loss. The state of queerness is
incommensurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of my writing in this section is to draw the ties between
racial critique and queer, in a way that doesn’t diminish or
wrongfully appropriate the POC scholarship. I’m not trying to suggest
an equivalence, but pointing out that this kind of work has already
been done in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section sets up the last part of the chapter, where I’ll discuss
the preferred method of speculation, drawing from speculative history
methods by Saidiya Hartman, Lisa Lowe, and David Kazanjian, among
others such as Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga. The harm of
paranoia comes from the subject/object divide, where the dominant
subject takes control/power over the other. Looking to work done in
slave history recovery, in chicanx studies and literature, we find
alternative ways of reading that involve speculation and play. They
require formalizing and abstracting what cannot be touched into a
touchable format. It involves playing with vantages (Lauren Klein),
provisionality (Julia Flanders, Susan Brown), and performance

Only the past
week have I been able to return to my dissertation work, and just to
go over my reading notes taken in the weeks prior to march 16, when I
left New York. I was working through a mountain of reading and
research in response to a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Caladoscope/status/1232711183288934400&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; I
sent out about a month ago asking for examples of
non-white-cis-male-het distant reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after this time of research and note-taking, I feel ready to start
writing again, and I’m starting to constellate some of the central
findings in the work of great feminist scholarship on distant
reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I zeroed in on what I see as the crux of my chapter’s
argument, where I think much of this research will be deployed. The
chapter starts off with this conundrum—pointing out the necessity of
touch, and then the reality of queer experience and “raw data” which
are untouchable, sharing in the status of being constructed in some
way. The answer to handling this construction is to celebrate the
necessity of critical detachment and how it opens up the way we
interface with constructions. By abstracting data we can move with
them and find new modes of moving with with them. The method lies in
bodies “touching” through their own abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my reading, I found that much of the writers were inspired by
Drucker, or build off Drucker’s ideas as foundational to their
thinking. There is this general agreement that all data is capta. They
build off this notion into different directions, and below are the two
strands I find most useful for my project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the first is the strand of &lt;em&gt;criticism as performance&lt;/em&gt;. Critics like
Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement stress the performativity of the
critical process; Bode emphasizing more the materiality of the
critical apparatus, and Clement emphasizing the process of
discovery. Both are heavily indebted to ideas from textual
criticism, particularly of Jerome McGann. They are formalists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the second strand is of &lt;em&gt;dynamicity&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;vantages&lt;/em&gt;. These critics
look at how computation affords possibilities for social critique by
refusing “totalizing” narratives and approaching modeling as
something partial yet dynamic. Lauren Klein looks for methods that
engage multiple dimensions of the invisible in data; Laura Mandell
at how we might “animate numerical processes” rather than establish
them; and Susan Brown’s category work exhorts critics to work with
provisionality, rather than aim for permanence. I could also add
Julia Flanders and Pamela Caughie to this list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense for me to separate these two strands? They are both
based on approaching criticism as a vital exercise, but they seem to
differ on the emphasis of social vs formal critique. Is that a
separation I want to uphold here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m really interested is in how these critics address the body in
their processes. How can I incorporate a concern for affect here?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="performance" /><summary type="html">It’s been difficult to stay focused during the pandemic.

theory and dh methods, focusing on what they share—the sensitivity
to textual objects, mediated by the critic’s self-consciousness of her
distance from the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been difficult to keep a structure, and I continue to revise my
outlines as I add more theorists. So far, I’ve come up with this
master sketch for the chapter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;touch as a reading method: making &amp;amp; opening connections
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;anzaldua and sedgwick on touch as connective and multiplying&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;queerness as untouchable: something we cannot fully grasp
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;love and cvetkovitch on queer negativity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data as unknowable: something we cannot fully grasp
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;drucker and underwood on studying cooked data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the illusion of critical detachment, we need bodies
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;felski’s affective method&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sedgwick on reparative reading&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abstraction as necessary in order to bring things into relation
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sedgwick on generative shame&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;klein on figuring what is absent&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the parallels between DH and Queer theorists, different reading
styles; refocus on touch
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;feminist distant reading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;mcgann, ramsay on deformance, piper on close &amp;amp; distant.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;example of queer theorist who is guided by
touching/feeling… affect theories? Munoz, Anzaldua, Ahmed…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my reading of /voyant-tools/ &amp;amp; /waves/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progression builds off the notion of touch, then immediately
brings in that which is untouchable—queerness and data, and starts
to plot how we might move from there, into a criticism that celebrates
detachment by turning to the body and abstraction. Bodies engaging
with the subject matter through abstraction. By abstracting data, we
can move within them and interface with them. Something along those
lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing process is slow, as I’m trying to coordinate my readings
of the critics and bring them into a narrative. There are moments,
however, when I break free from my critics, to articulate without
substantiation the focus on touch and the necessity of critical
distance. In those moments the writing is loose and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m trying very deliberately to base my method on work
done by women and especially queer women of color. When it comes to
digital humanities, this has been tough, because as Sara Ahmed says,
whiteness and maleness automatically reproduce themselves. We
reproduce them without intention, and it takes a willful effort to
center other voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that vein, I tweeted out a call for “non-cishet-white-male distant
reading.” The responses I got were overwhelming, with people citing
their own work and others. So I’m inundated with some exciting reading
for the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="distant reading" /><category term="methods" /><category term="feminism" /><summary type="html">Over the past two weeks, I continue to interweave discussions on queer theory and dh methods, focusing on what they share—the sensitivity to textual objects, mediated by the critic’s self-consciousness of her distance from the object.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Queerness as Data</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/qt/queer-data/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Queerness as Data" /><published>2020-02-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-02-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/qt/queer-data</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/qt/queer-data/">&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been taking the first stabs at the dissertation, trying to get
down a draft of the foundational chapter, which is about methods. The
goal is to weave together reading methods from specific strands of
Queer Theory and the Digital Humanities, trying to fixate on what they
share, which is a sensitivity to the critic’s distance from the
textual subject, a relationality. I’m trying to map out this
parallelism about the way that these theorists treat the objects of
their study—as incapable of being fully figured—and the moment of
convergence, which is the act of identification, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Queer Theory side, I’ve started with Heather Love’s &lt;em&gt;Feeling
Backward&lt;/em&gt;, drawing out Love’s descriptions of queer subjects as
unredeemable and lost in their own sufffering. She is largely
responding to critical narratives that try to resolve or recuperate
the psychic trauma undergone by queer subjects, transforming them into
pride, liberation, or at least the acknowledgment of repression. She
argues against an “affirmative” reading of these subjects, insisting
instead that critics allow them their ambiguity and use that as a
foundation for theorizing. For example, she reads in Walter Pater a
hesitance, a preference to linger in a space of withdrawal, before the
emergence of modern homosexual identity, in “a world in which time was
suspended” (58). Her reading materializes the “dual movement of
solicitation and self-effacement” (59) in his writing, and theorizes
what she calls “the epistemology of the vestibule” (64) into a
politics of suspension and inaction. For Love, the experience of
queerness cannot be captured, it is something raw and elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Love’s “feeling backward,” I turn to an example from DH about
analytical methods that cannot fully capture the complexity of
data. Johanna Drucker’s “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display”
explains how all data, rather than “given,” is actually “taken” or
constructed, what she calls &lt;em&gt;capta&lt;/em&gt;. Drucker goes into detail about
how quantification necessarily reduces and eliminates many aspects
about itself, obscuring its own interpretive choices. She gives the
example of a graph which shows number of books published by year, and
points out that such a graph hides the reason for choosing
“publication date” as a measure of productivity, rather than, for
instance, composition, editing, review, distribution, etc. For
Drucker, all visualizations, in simplifying and regularizing their
data, collapse certain aspects about their subjects in ways that mask
their actual constructedness. To counter this misrepresentation,
Drucker deliberately messes with graphical metrics, breaking lines and
blurring bars, showing how the entities of data are actually fuzzy,
malleable, and above all, unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between Drucker and Love, I try to bring out the way they similarly
approach the objects of their study as somehow beyond the critic’s
grasp. Drucker makes evident what is overlooked or assumed when
dealing with complex subjects. She places those elements there, for
all to see, in a way that muddles the relationship between them. Like
Love, Drucker works on the “image of exile, of refusal, even of
failure” (Love 71).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step for me is to hone this idea of identification. In my
section on Love, I spend some time proposing identification as a
reading method. By “identification,” I mean the act in which the
critic finds something in the textual subject that touches or
&lt;em&gt;coincides&lt;/em&gt; with the critic. In what ways does this act of
“identification” also relate to the ways we respond to graphical or
quantified information? Can we “identify” with a graphic? I’m not sure
this is the route to go. I think I need to reframe identification as a
means of feeling, of being pulled forward. What pulls the reader
through a queer narrative, similarly to what pulls the user through a
graphical interface. It is a motive force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other things that came up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Throughout my discussion of Drucker, I’m trying to respond to
Moretti (presenting him in direct opposition to many of her ideas)
without naming him explicitly in the body of my writing. Instead, I’m
relegating him to the footnotes, an appendage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve also been reading Yiyun Li’s &lt;em&gt;Dear Friend, from my Life I Write
to you in your Life&lt;/em&gt;, which is clarifying the way that I think about
the confines of identification. Li very clearly presents a paradigm
for reading &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to identify (she doesn’t see herself in ficitonal
characters) but to acquire a certain invisibility among others. Need
to think more about this need to be with but not of the subjects that
we read.&lt;/li&gt;

proposals. I’ve applied to two places (the DSRG and the Clark) to get
money to go to LA and see the Wilde typescript. Besides these
applications, I also submitted an abstract to a special edition of
Digital Humanities Quarterly on Minimal Computing, on my highlighter
tool as a tool that resists the tendency of EdTech to track and
quantify student data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing out the various proposals forced me to see my project within
the space of few sentences, and I struggled here to articulate the
role of “queerness.” Here’s what I came up with in the intro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Within the broad field of the Digital Humanities (DH), an emerging
Queer DH explores what is queer about digital methods and media. These
initiatives often critique the practice of using digital tools to
verify, correct, or establish “facts” about cultural materials,
preferring instead to orient technological contexts around speculation
and experimentation. In support of such efforts, my project excavates
the limitations of digital methods that overlook or collapse the
complexity of literary materials to consider how they might open
possibilities for queer scholarship. I examine how the processes of
electronic editing, social reading and archiving tools draw attention
to the ambiguities of queer subjectivity, experience, and
embodiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point I was trying to get across is how “queerness” in media
centers on the ways that tools act unexpectedly, give us unexpected or
suprising results—they are “queer” in sense that they diverge from
the “norm”. This idiosyncrasy (and it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an idiosyncrasy) of digital
tools results from the condition of being embodied, of their material
and physical existence as hardware and software, a condition that’s
often overlooked by what Matt Kirschenbaum calls digital media’s
“formal materiality,” the illusion that objects on the screen have no
connection to hardware realities. So, in order to explore this
condition, it’s necessary to take apart the machine, to look at its
components and software to see how it works. We start to see how
machines are not the flawless, homogenous, objective workers we
thought them to be, we see how they are built by humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we begin to look more closely into computational processes, we also
see the parallels between computational and human cognitive
processing. We start to appreciate how both humans and machines
closely resemble each other, how they both make mistakes and
misreadings. We start to develop a new way of understanding how they
might interact, how they can fit (or mis/fit) together. This is where
queer materiality leads to dis/ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a strange trajectory of ideas here: first I’m saying that there’s
something flawed and messed up about computers, something
fundamentally physical and therefore unpredictable. Then I’m saying
this problem with computers actually reflects the way that humans are
built, the way that human bodies, perception, memory works. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; I’m
saying that this creates new ways of looking at human/computer
interactions. This new way accepts difference, surprise,
strangeness—queerness—as a minimum for interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to me a very tenuous line of argument, something that can
be easily critiqued and taken down at each step. Especially when
considering the other ways I use queer, which is a reading practice
and a subject matter. Maybe those other understanding of queer build
toward this one about media and bodies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thought—more exciting—that my dissertation chapters can
focus on one part of the above argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first chapter: on reading—there is something fundamentally
physical and therefore unpredictable about computational
processes. Creates a critical distance /relationality between reader
and text.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;second chapter: on editing—this issue with computers actually
reflects back to a human issue (Caughie: the questioning of
computing gender leads us back to gender ontology) of fully knowing
and formalizing ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;third chapter: on annotating—this queerness shared across humans
and computers can guide the way we create/use digital tools, in a
way that accepts difference, surprise, strangeness as a minimum for
interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fourth chapter: archiving—do I need a fourth chapter? Maybe this
can become some kind of epilogue&lt;/li&gt;
