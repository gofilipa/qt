the first chapter and to complete a readable draft of the second
chapter by August 31. I managed to make that goal, though a few days
late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to repurpose most of my seminar paper on &lt;em&gt;Dorian Gray&lt;/em&gt;,
about 15 pages or so, into this chapter. They formed the background
discussion of the manuscript and the analysis of the revisions in the
first chapter. Then came a period of heavy writing, about two weeks,
where I created new sections on “Queer Historiography,” “TEI,” an
introduction and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper explores how to use TEI to mark up the homoerotic elements
that Wilde revised and obscured in the first chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Dorian
Gray&lt;/em&gt; manuscript. I first examine the question of perservation in the
field of Textual Editing, drawing out a debate between the more
“conservative” (favoring preservation via the discovery of authorial
intention) and the more “productive” approach which fully develops
with the advent of digital media (and uses digital media to explore
productive permutations and presentations of textual material). Then I
bring another scholarly debate for comparison, which is the debate on
the proper methodology for Queer Historiography, that is, whether it
is possible or desirable for critics in the present to adequately know
queerness in the past. I isolate one perspective, that of Heather Love
and what she calls “feeling backward,” which attends to the past
without trying to redeem or rescue it, as a guide toward developing my
editing methodology. I then turn to the manuscript itself, to examine
and analyze the changes that Wilde imposes on the homoerotic elements
from the first chapter. My reading here highlights a number of
“themes” that reveal what Wilde’s pen worked to suppress, and include:
“tension,” “affection,” “passion,” “beauty,” and “fatality.”  Finally,
I turn to the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) language itself, pointing
out its characteristics relevant to my project, such as one seeming
contradiction between the potential for customization (TEI allows for
researchers to create custom tags according to the needs of the
project) and the constrained nature of the tags which nonetheless
impose a level of legibility and fixity on the text. I conclude by
demonstrating how my method marks up homoerotic elements, although not
in a way that fixes them or makes them more legible to
researchers. Rather, the markup serves to index moments where the
tagging and labelling fails to capture how the homoerotic themes
appear and function in the text. Here, the lesson from Queer
Historiography comes to the fore: the act of marking up a text, which
can never fully capture the queer elements of the text, really
functions more as a tool for discovering those moments that elude
containment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having submitted this draft for review, I don’t think there’s much to
do with it now but wait for revisions. In the meantime, I will go back
to the first chapter (for the third time!) to get it ready for Matt’s
eyes. Hopefully a couple of weeks will help get it into “readable” form.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="TEI" /><category term="text encoding" /><category term="Oscar Wilde" /><category term="Dorian Gray" /><category term="Manuscript" /><summary type="html">The goal for the summer was to address the remaining small edits of the first chapter and to complete a readable draft of the second chapter by August 31.

intriguing, particularly in the way it interweaveas deformance and

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I really should be talking to my advisor about it. Even
if the prose isn’t ready to share, the ideas are workable. Before
that, though, I’m going to give myself a week to revise some things
that stand out to me, in this order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add more up front on the technology of Distant Reading, how it
works, a kind of media archaeology of the tech.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flesh out the final analysis of Woolf’s text (which depends on the
specifics of Disant Reading tech).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find a way to structurally integrate the close reading of Woolf’s
text. Interweave with the intro? Maybe starting with a meditation on
gender?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, my abstract on this chapter was accepted by the ACH
conference. One other abstract (on my second chapter, which I am now
in the process of researching) was accepted at MLA, as well as a book

example of text analysis), I’m deeming the first draft of my first
chapter complete. It’s been nearly a year, and the thing has taken so
many shapes, texts, interventions in the meantime. Although there’s
still a little more work to do, fleshing out some text analysis with
Python, the thing is being set aside. It doesn’t feel totally done –
in fact I feel slightly guilty for setting it aside – but I know that
any attempt to finalize it right now will just have to be revised once
I progress through other chapters and my intervention develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an abstract for the project, which I recently submitted to
the [ACH conference][https://ach2021.ach.org/]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queer Distant Reading: Quantifying Gender in Woolf’s “Orlando”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project explores how Queer Studies and quantitative text analysis
might work together to analyze queer identity in 20th and 21st century
literature. In recent years, practitioners of distant reading have
been grappling with the problem of quantifying gender and sexuality,
among other aspects of minority identity. My project intervenes in
this debate by exploring one of the stickier aspects of distant
reading–reproducibility. I trace a genealogy of reproducibility from
distant reading’s inception in Franco Moretti’s call for a
“falsifiable criticism” to more recent experiments in which
researchers “reproduce” their assumptions about social categories in
the results of their analysis. However, rather than condemn the
reproducible, this project unpacks its radical potential by reworking
it to engage with Judith Butler’s concept of performativity. Bringing
Butler’s foundational ideas about “performative citation” from Queer
Theory to distant reading, I propose a methodology that achieves
displacement through repetition, subversion through iteration, and
resistance from within the flattening processes of
quantification. This method illustrates how the iterative practice of
analyzing text computationally can surface new textual structures and
resignify elements of that text. I demonstrate this critical method
with an analysis of Virginia Woolf’s text, Orlando: A Biography (1928)
to explore how the terms “man” and “woman” can be re-signified to
multiply our already complex understanding of gender in that
text. This method harnesses the reductions of reproducibility within
text analytical methods in order to advance the study of queer
identity in Queer Studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="text analysis" /><category term="queer distant reading" /><summary type="html">Even though I still need to finalize the conclusion (and add a final example of text analysis), I’m deeming the first draft of my first chapter complete.

form. I had a meeting with my dissertation workshop in late October
that revealed to me how I was writing around the argument I wanted to
make, which is about deconstructing (in NKM’s words) “the fantasy of
the falsifiable.” So I cut about half of what I had already written,
the sections on the digital, queerness, and touch, and moved that to
an introductory chapter. What remained was the section where I
critique “reproducible” criticism, and that was pretty much it. Around
this section, I’ve written another on textual scholarship and
deformance, and one on queer performance. I’m now working on the final
section of the chapter, where I synthesize aspects from deformance and
preformance to present a new approach for “queer” text analysis. After
that, I will write up a quick intro that begins be presenting a
critique of the falsifiable, which I position as forerunner to the
reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of the chapter is to describe how to do text analysis in a
way that attends to queer concepts of performativity, and how that
method enhances the critical process. It begins by debunking the
fantasy of falsifiable criticism, presenting a critique of moretti’s
methodology and stylistic approach (eventually with accompanying text
analysis). It then goes into a critique of current distant reading
practices, discussing Ted Underwood, Nan Z. Da, to emphasize how these
practices can often reproduce the critic’s assumptions. This section
also discusses the work of Johanna Drucker and Richard Jean So,
emphasizing that their methods do a good job deconstructing social
categories. While this deconstruction is important, I’m interested in
analysis of text that disrupts what we know about these literary
materials by producing new structures, or formalizations of these
texts. Then, I go into a history of textual scholarship, focusing
particularly on the work of Jerome McGann, Tanya Clement, and
Katherine Bode, who offer a deformative and speculative understanding
of critical analysis that is useful for my proposal. Then, I dip into
Queer Theory, in particular Judith Butler’s concepts of performativity
and citation, which lend an understanding to the ways that critical
processes can subvert dominant structures through iteration, or
“performative citation.” This notion of displacement through
repetition is applied back to text analysis to illustrate how the
iterative process of analyzing text can surface new textual structures
that re-signify certain elements of that text. The chapter ends with
my reading of Virginia Woolf’s /Orlando/, to show how our
understanding of “man” and “woman” in that text is re-signified
through this kind of text analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps, is to continue to explore /Orlando/ and Moretti in Python
(though not for too long) so I can write up this final section and the
introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

workshop. Below is the feedback I received, indicating points for
revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, positives: people are really compelled by my topic and close
readings. They appreciate the ways I am engaging DH and Queer Theory
around the trope of “touch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for the criticism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three heavy footnotes in the beginning are tripping people up, a
bit overwhelming. Work on spreading this out. In doing so, luxuriate
in the idea of how digital etymology relates to the idea of touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clarify specific terms/concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kirschenbaum&lt;/strong&gt;? Characterize him a little bit for
outsiders. Situate myself in relation to him. Also consider taking
out or reducing the footnote on materiality, because it’s tripping
people up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain why I am choosing this word &lt;strong&gt;formalization&lt;/strong&gt; to describe a
construct. What does this term do that “construct” cannot do?
Another sentence on what I mean here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What Queer theory am I using, at &lt;strong&gt;reconsolidation&lt;/strong&gt;. The
abstraction of the queer subject. (related to the issue of
positioning myself w/ regard to queer theory: The ways that queer
subjectivity is constructed differently in early poststructrualism,
as opposed to affect theory. Affect theory tries to bring the body
back, thinking to Sara Ahmed vs Foucault). In addition to defining
my position/sources, also consider how “queer” can be reclaimed by
those it is meant to oppress (Butler, ‘Critically Queer’).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the sensual fullness of a lack&lt;/strong&gt;: see butler on beauvoir and
irigaray, two women together as a double lack, in gender
trouble. /When our two lips touch/, Irigaray&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;see how &lt;strong&gt;haptic&lt;/strong&gt; is being deployed in other disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what do I mean by &lt;strong&gt;touch as abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; on page 3? The physical
experience of touch may be an abstraction, or abstracted, but it is
not experienced as such. Jacob: “Touch often registers as painful
immediacy”. See Ann Cvetkovitch’s writing on Stone Butch Blues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on page 3, I’m making sweeping claims about the &lt;strong&gt;Queer
Subject&lt;/strong&gt;. Is there a single queer subject, a queer subjectivity? Do
the narrators demonstrate this? If so, what is that kind of queer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how does the digital relate to the &lt;strong&gt;body&lt;/strong&gt;? how does it change the
body? how does queerness do this? –&amp;gt; Butler’s points about how a
body doesn’t come into being until contact in /Bodies that Matter/.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what am I doing with &lt;strong&gt;touch more broadly&lt;/strong&gt;? why is this chapter
about touch?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emphasize that I’m doing this &lt;strong&gt;new thing&lt;/strong&gt;, this new field. DH can
help us theorize the queer; and queer can help us understand the
Digital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarify the relationship between &lt;strong&gt;removal, touch, and grasp&lt;/strong&gt;. How
are these distinct?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In close readings, &lt;strong&gt;the various registers of touch&lt;/strong&gt; are at odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I start the chapter by saying that queer and the digital are related
through touch, then I assert that it is a troubled relationship to
touch. Make it clear at the start that I’m thinking about touch as a
complicated activity/phenomenon, not touch as always making
contact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the implications of touch are slightly different or opposite to
each other across the close readings. One is frustrated touch and
one touch opens up. Establish the connection between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a tension between literal touch (touching the text) and
figurative touch (touch as a trope, touch via sight). Emphasize and
distinguish the difference between touch as a figure within the text
and as a means of engaging without the text. Additionally, on the
literal side, how is this touch (clicking through) different from
turning the page?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;revise the close reading of /waves/ to include analysis of the beam
routine. How is touch operating? there is no touch in this scene.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the paradox of touch: the untouchable is good — it is a paradox.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the paradox of touch: touching w/o touching&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revise close-reading of /Waves/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people found it confusing regarding “touch” and doesn’t cohere as
nicely as /Confessions/ with my chapter argument.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emphasize dynamics of the beam routine, the not touching in that
episode paralleling the not touching of /Confessions/.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain clearly the removal between reader and text not only in the
level of narrative form but also in the materiality of the substance
of the story, the codes and computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More readings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on Munoz –&amp;gt; also think about Raymond Williams, and structures of
feelings which will help you elaborate on emergence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;will narratology help me clarify some of the terms on page 6, on the
close readings of /Waves/? Mieke Bal perhaps.&lt;/li&gt;

doc. Until now, I’ve only been engaging with the draft on through the
text editor Emacs using Org Mode, an amazing format that allows you to
collapse paragraphs and outlines to make writing cleaner and more
navigable. As a result, however, I didn’t have a sense of how long my
document was until I opened it in Word. Turns out I have 34 pages
single spaced. And I still need to draft what I think will take up
about one third of the chapter. Clearly, some revision and
reorganization is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took the week to go through the entire doc, writing concise
notes and outlines of my work so far, and flagging things that still
need to be done. Below is an image of the first 2/3 or so of the
chapter draft, showing the outline and flags for specific sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/org_outline.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of chapter outline in emacs org
mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking this time to step back and see the big picture, I feel a
lot better about the work that I’ve already achieved, though almost
all of the paragraphs need some work in revising and refining. There’s
still a long way to go, but there’s also an arc here, a form of my
argument that takes shape despite the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m going to set some goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first, the next week (July 27) I will draft the final third of the
chapter. This will be hard work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the next two weeks, (august 3 &amp;amp; 10) will be spent on cleaning up the
first three sections, “intro to touch” and “queerness as untouchable,”
and “solutions.” This is to prepare for sharing those pages with my
Undercommons writing group in mid-August.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then, starting August 17 until September, I’ll revise the rest of
the chapter, fulfilling any lingering TODOs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;following this schedule, by the end of August I will hopefully have
something, even if not perfect, to send to Matt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I revise, I find myself more and more myred in the various
definitions of queerness. It will be important to keep the following
in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being queer is, at its core, a desire for connection—with oneself
or with others—that is continually thwarted by the oppression,
categories, and heteronormativity of dominant culture. Queerness which
we can only engage within formalized or opaque structures—the formal
experiments of queer writers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “untouchable” denotes a state of &lt;em&gt;suspended knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (about queer
subjectivity and experience) that allows me to then turn to &lt;em&gt;feeling
and affect&lt;/em&gt; as epistemological methods.&lt;/li&gt;

and how it functions in relation to queerness. “Untouchable” denotes a
state of &lt;em&gt;suspended knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (about queer subjectivity and
experience) that allows me to then turn to &lt;em&gt;feeling and affect&lt;/em&gt; as
epistemological methods.
    - First, I worked out a definition of “untouchable” as the raw
      data about queer subjectivity and experience that cannot be
      quantified. (later in the chapter, I will explain that in order
      to engage (or “interface”) with this data, we need abstraction
      and formalization.
	- Then, I looked for analogies of the “untouchable” in other
      fields (history and science) that display the impulse to verify,
      correct, or recover. In literary studies, this impulse for
      satisfaction is observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading
      practices, which attempt to find “hidden meaning” in texts in a
      way that constrains inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past two weeks, I’ve been working on the introduction, because
it occurs to me that I need a solid definition of queerness before
moving on to describe how queerness is untouchable. So I defined the
core condition of queerness being &lt;strong&gt;“the desire for touching,” a
desire that is ultimately frustrated, deferred, or eluded&lt;/strong&gt; (analogous
to Jose Munoz’s concept of queer horizon, the state of being “not yet
here”). Being queer is, at its core, a desire for connection—with
oneself or with others—that is continually thwarted by the
oppression, categories, and heteronormativity of dominant culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “desire for touching,” without being able to fully touch, as the
definition of queerness, is also where the digital and queer
intersect. Digital media creates the illusion that we have access to
data, to information, but all we have access to is a &lt;em&gt;formalized&lt;/em&gt;
relationship to that data. We encounter the digital object through
mediation, through an interface, mice, GUIs, keyboards, etc. It is the
same with queernes, which we can only engage within formalized or
opaque structures—the formal experiments of queer writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to begin the chapter with this meditation on the
intersection of the digital and queerness. Right now, I’m doing so by
providing a few close readings, right at the start, which define
queerness as a thwarted desire for touching. In the example I’ve
chosen, by Jordy Rosenberg’s &lt;em&gt;Confessions of the Fox&lt;/em&gt;, I use an
evocative quote that characterizes sexual desire not on touch, but how
precluding touch activates other sensations that are more physical,
more intense, than touch. Then I jump to a hypertext novella, &lt;em&gt;These
Waves of Girls&lt;/em&gt; by Caitlin Fisher, and discuss how the narrative pull
of clicking through the text enacts a desire for closure or
understanding that is never fully satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me now that I need to go a little more into the &lt;em&gt;Waves&lt;/em&gt;
example, include a bit of media archaeology, the formal and forensic
(Matt Kirschenbaum) levels of materiality, and a bit about how
hypertext works, to fully round out this point. I’m drawing a parallel
between what Rosenberg is doing with refusing touch and what Fisher is
doing by frustrating touch. They are both searching for alternative
modes of connections, modes that active a fuller sensorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the introduction might be structured thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an opening statement on how touch relates to queerness and the
digital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a definition of queerness as deferred desire for touching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introducing two case studies that demonstrate how queerness engages
this idea of deffered touch in text and digital media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, which is only meant to pique interest and
 set ideas into motion, I will move on to exploring the “untouchable”
 state of queerness in depth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="rosenberg" /><category term="fisher" /><category term="munoz" /><summary type="html">My past two posts have been clarifying the concept of “untouchable” and how it functions in relation to queerness. “Untouchable” denotes a state of suspended knowledge (about queer subjectivity and experience) that allows me to then turn to feeling and affect as epistemological methods. - First, I worked out a definition of “untouchable” as the raw data about queer subjectivity and experience that cannot be quantified. (later in the chapter, I will explain that in order to engage (or “interface”) with this data, we need abstraction and formalization. - Then, I looked for analogies of the “untouchable” in other fields (history and science) that display the impulse to verify, correct, or recover. In literary studies, this impulse for satisfaction is observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading practices, which attempt to find “hidden meaning” in texts in a way that constrains inquiry.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Untouchable Queerness</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/qt/the-untouchable/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Untouchable Queerness" /><published>2020-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/qt/the-untouchable</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/qt/the-untouchable/">&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I started to organize my thoughts on feminist distant
reading. My focus was to work out how we might open up the way we
interface with queerness as “untouchable,” as the raw data that cannot
be quantified. The solution is to abstract and formalize so we can
move or “interface” with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I have dived into the issue of the
“untouchable”—what does it mean for the way we do critique?
Primarily, I’ve been looking for ways that other fields have eschewed
the impulse to verify, correct, or recover. In what follows, I outline
the main argument from the first third of my chapter, where I lay out
the state of queerness as “untouchable” by finding analogies in the
fields of science and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, queerness is defined as a desire for touch (the digital), a
desire that cannot be satisfied, redeemed, or recovered. This impulse
for satisfaction is observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading
practices, which seek to answer or discover the “hidden” meaning in
text. These practices attempt to answer questions, but do so in a way
that constrains inquiry. This is because paranoia only delivers the
results that are /imaginable/ within current the knowledge
structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the harm of paranoia, for example, in methods of science and
histor. We encounter excellent critiques of these methods particularly
in recovery projects, such as slave history or the black
atlantic. Here, the goal of recovery creates a system of inquiry that
predetermines the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is related to queerness, which is untouchable. It is a feeling of
embodied disembodiment, estrangement, loss. The state of queerness is
incommensurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of my writing in this section is to draw the ties between
racial critique and queer, in a way that doesn’t diminish or
wrongfully appropriate the POC scholarship. I’m not trying to suggest
an equivalence, but pointing out that this kind of work has already
been done in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section sets up the last part of the chapter, where I’ll discuss
the preferred method of speculation, drawing from speculative history
methods by Saidiya Hartman, Lisa Lowe, and David Kazanjian, among
others such as Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga. The harm of
paranoia comes from the subject/object divide, where the dominant
subject takes control/power over the other. Looking to work done in
slave history recovery, in chicanx studies and literature, we find
alternative ways of reading that involve speculation and play. They
require formalizing and abstracting what cannot be touched into a
touchable format. It involves playing with vantages (Lauren Klein),
provisionality (Julia Flanders, Susan Brown), and performance
(Katherine Bode, Tanya Clement).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="queer of color critique" /><summary type="html">In my last post, I started to organize my thoughts on feminist distant reading.

Only the past
week have I been able to return to my dissertation work, and just to
go over my reading notes taken in the weeks prior to march 16, when I
left New York. I was working through a mountain of reading and
research in response to a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Caladoscope/status/1232711183288934400&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; I
sent out about a month ago asking for examples of
non-white-cis-male-het distant reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after this time of research and note-taking, I feel ready to start
writing again, and I’m starting to constellate some of the central
findings in the work of great feminist scholarship on distant
reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I zeroed in on what I see as the crux of my chapter’s
argument, where I think much of this research will be deployed. The
chapter starts off with this conundrum—pointing out the necessity of
touch, and then the reality of queer experience and “raw data” which
are untouchable, sharing in the status of being constructed in some
way. The answer to handling this construction is to celebrate the
necessity of critical detachment and how it opens up the way we
interface with constructions. By abstracting data we can move with
them and find new modes of moving with with them. The method lies in
bodies “touching” through their own abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my reading, I found that much of the writers were inspired by
Drucker, or build off Drucker’s ideas as foundational to their
thinking. There is this general agreement that all data is capta. They
build off this notion into different directions, and below are the two
strands I find most useful for my project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the first is the strand of &lt;em&gt;criticism as performance&lt;/em&gt;. Critics like
Katherine Bode and Tanya Clement stress the performativity of the
critical process; Bode emphasizing more the materiality of the
critical apparatus, and Clement emphasizing the process of
discovery. Both are heavily indebted to ideas from textual
criticism, particularly of Jerome McGann. They are formalists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the second strand is of &lt;em&gt;dynamicity&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;vantages&lt;/em&gt;. These critics
look at how computation affords possibilities for social critique by
refusing “totalizing” narratives and approaching modeling as
something partial yet dynamic. Lauren Klein looks for methods that
engage multiple dimensions of the invisible in data; Laura Mandell
at how we might “animate numerical processes” rather than establish
them; and Susan Brown’s category work exhorts critics to work with
provisionality, rather than aim for permanence. I could also add
Julia Flanders and Pamela Caughie to this list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense for me to separate these two strands? They are both
based on approaching criticism as a vital exercise, but they seem to
differ on the emphasis of social vs formal critique. Is that a
separation I want to uphold here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m really interested is in how these critics address the body in
their processes. How can I incorporate a concern for affect here?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="performance" /><summary type="html">It’s been difficult to stay focused during the pandemic.

theory and dh methods, focusing on what they share—the sensitivity
to textual objects, mediated by the critic’s self-consciousness of her
distance from the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been difficult to keep a structure, and I continue to revise my
outlines as I add more theorists. So far, I’ve come up with this
master sketch for the chapter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;touch as a reading method: making &amp;amp; opening connections
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;anzaldua and sedgwick on touch as connective and multiplying&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;queerness as untouchable: something we cannot fully grasp
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;love and cvetkovitch on queer negativity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data as unknowable: something we cannot fully grasp
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;drucker and underwood on studying cooked data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the illusion of critical detachment, we need bodies
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;felski’s affective method&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sedgwick on reparative reading&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abstraction as necessary in order to bring things into relation
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sedgwick on generative shame&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;klein on figuring what is absent&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the parallels between DH and Queer theorists, different reading
styles; refocus on touch
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;feminist distant reading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;mcgann, ramsay on deformance, piper on close &amp;amp; distant.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;example of queer theorist who is guided by
touching/feeling… affect theories? Munoz, Anzaldua, Ahmed…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my reading of /voyant-tools/ &amp;amp; /waves/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progression builds off the notion of touch, then immediately
brings in that which is untouchable—queerness and data, and starts
to plot how we might move from there, into a criticism that celebrates
detachment by turning to the body and abstraction. Bodies engaging
with the subject matter through abstraction. By abstracting data, we
can move within them and interface with them. Something along those
lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing process is slow, as I’m trying to coordinate my readings
of the critics and bring them into a narrative. There are moments,
however, when I break free from my critics, to articulate without
substantiation the focus on touch and the necessity of critical
distance. In those moments the writing is loose and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m trying very deliberately to base my method on work
done by women and especially queer women of color. When it comes to
digital humanities, this has been tough, because as Sara Ahmed says,
whiteness and maleness automatically reproduce themselves. We
reproduce them without intention, and it takes a willful effort to
center other voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that vein, I tweeted out a call for “non-cishet-white-male distant
reading.” The responses I got were overwhelming, with people citing
their own work and others. So I’m inundated with some exciting reading
for the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Filipa Calado</name></author><category term="dissertation" /><category term="distant reading" /><category term="methods" /><category term="feminism" /><summary type="html">Over the past two weeks, I continue to interweave discussions on queer theory and dh methods, focusing on what they share—the sensitivity to textual objects, mediated by the critic’s self-consciousness of her distance from the object.</summary></entry></feed>
