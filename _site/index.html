        <p>Since the spring my ideas for this chapter have solidified, and I am
beginning to see what the argument may look like. In the past few days
the fragments are coming together as a whole, to my surprise, as I’ve
become increasingly desperate, beating my head against a wall to make
two things talk to each other which don’t speak the same language –
media archaeology and black feminist studies. In looking for some way
to talk about race and technology from a material standpoint, I landed
on the concept of the flesh, and have been struggling to theorize from
black feminist notions of flesh (beginning with Spillers through
Snorton and Musser) to get at this kind of radical potential contained
within the flesh, which operates through opacity and surface. In my
reading of Black Femininist thinking on the flesh, particularly
Snorton, what I found was a capacious way of thinking about the
intersection of two registers, of the material (flesh) and
cultural/symbolic (race/gender), which I can apply back to my thinking
about technology, and the intersecting registers of the digital and
analog.</p>

        <p>These are some speculations for my third chapter, which I’m going to
begin researching this spring. Whereas the first two chapters were
about text analysis and text encoding, this chapter will be about
<em>media</em>. I’m looking to explore how an attention to the material
specificity of media enhances our reading of eletronic literary work,
such as hypertext and interactive fiction.</p>

        <p>The work on chapter two has been taking longer than I thought-
there were three weeks of heavy revision in October/November, where I
made the following changes at the request of my peer reviewers. Then
a round of copyediting, which is done, and the final round of
proofreading, to be completed next week, after which the thing will
finally go to press. The major revisions included:</p>

the first chapter and to complete a readable draft of the second
chapter by August 31. I managed to make that goal, though a few days
late.</p>

        <p>After letting the draft sit for a while, slightly traumatized by the
hectic process of wrapping it up over the winter, I was pleasantly
surprised by my perspective on it now. The argument that I found
discouragingly convoluted still reads as a bit messy but also
intriguing, particularly in the way it interweaveas deformance and
performativity.</p>

        <p>Even though I still need to finalize the conclusion (and add a final
example of text analysis), I’m deeming the first draft of my first
chapter complete. It’s been nearly a year, and the thing has taken so
many shapes, texts, interventions in the meantime. Although there’s
still a little more work to do, fleshing out some text analysis with
Python, the thing is being set aside. It doesn’t feel totally done –
in fact I feel slightly guilty for setting it aside – but I know that
any attempt to finalize it right now will just have to be revised once
I progress through other chapters and my intervention develops.</p>
