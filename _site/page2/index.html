        <p>In the past three months, this chapter has taken on a whole new
form. I had a meeting with my dissertation workshop in late October
that revealed to me how I was writing around the argument I wanted to
make, which is about deconstructing (in NKM’s words) “the fantasy of
the falsifiable.” So I cut about half of what I had already written,
the sections on the digital, queerness, and touch, and moved that to
an introductory chapter. What remained was the section where I
critique “reproducible” criticism, and that was pretty much it. Around
this section, I’ve written another on textual scholarship and
deformance, and one on queer performance. I’m now working on the final
section of the chapter, where I synthesize aspects from deformance and
preformance to present a new approach for “queer” text analysis. After
that, I will write up a quick intro that begins be presenting a
critique of the falsifiable, which I position as forerunner to the
reproducible.</p>

        <p>About a week ago I converted my chapter document into a word
doc. Until now, I’ve only been engaging with the draft on through the
text editor Emacs using Org Mode, an amazing format that allows you to
collapse paragraphs and outlines to make writing cleaner and more
navigable. As a result, however, I didn’t have a sense of how long my
document was until I opened it in Word. Turns out I have 34 pages
single spaced. And I still need to draft what I think will take up
about one third of the chapter. Clearly, some revision and
reorganization is necessary.</p>

        <p>My past two posts have been clarifying the concept of “untouchable”
and how it functions in relation to queerness. “Untouchable” denotes a
state of <em>suspended knowledge</em> (about queer subjectivity and
experience) that allows me to then turn to <em>feeling and affect</em> as
epistemological methods.
    - First, I worked out a definition of “untouchable” as the raw
      data about queer subjectivity and experience that cannot be
      quantified. (later in the chapter, I will explain that in order
      to engage (or “interface”) with this data, we need abstraction
      and formalization.
	- Then, I looked for analogies of the “untouchable” in other
      fields (history and science) that display the impulse to verify,
      correct, or recover. In literary studies, this impulse for
      satisfaction is observed in “paranoid” or “suspicious” reading
      practices, which attempt to find “hidden meaning” in texts in a
      way that constrains inquiry.</p>

        <p>In my last post, I started to organize my thoughts on feminist distant
reading. My focus was to work out how we might open up the way we
interface with queerness as “untouchable,” as the raw data that cannot
be quantified. The solution is to abstract and formalize so we can
move or “interface” with it.</p>

        <p>It’s been difficult to stay focused during the pandemic. Only the past
week have I been able to return to my dissertation work, and just to
go over my reading notes taken in the weeks prior to march 16, when I
left New York. I was working through a mountain of reading and
research in response to a
<a href="https://twitter.com/Caladoscope/status/1232711183288934400">tweet</a> I
sent out about a month ago asking for examples of
non-white-cis-male-het distant reading.</p>
